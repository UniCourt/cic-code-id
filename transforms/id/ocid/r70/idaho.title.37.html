       When the employment of a health care provider has been terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, for adulteration or misappropriation of controlled substances, as defined in chapter 27, title 37, Idaho Code, the employer shall, within thirty (30) days of the termination, furnish written notice of the termination, described herein as “notice of termination,” to the health care provider’s professional licensing board of the state of Idaho, which shall include a description of the controlled substance adulteration or misappropriation involved in the termination. An employer who in good faith provides such information shall not be held civilly liable for the disclosure or the consequences of providing the information. There is a rebuttable presumption that an employer is acting in good faith when the employer provides such information. The presumption of good faith is overcome only upon showing by clear and convincing evidence that the employer disclosed the information with actual malice or with deliberate intent to mislead. For the purposes of this section, “actual malice” means knowledge that the information was false or given with reckless disregard of whether the information was false. For the purposes of this section, the term “health care provider” means any person licensed by a professional licensing board of the state of Idaho whose license permits the health care provider to dispense or administer controlled substances. For the purposes of this section, “employer” means a person or entity licensed under chapter 18, title 54, Idaho Code, or chapter 13, title 39, Idaho Code, who employs a health care provider or providers.

       A professional licensing board that receives a notice of termination from an employer pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall maintain the notice of termination for the health care provider. The notice of termination shall be subject to disclosure in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c01s37-117Aol13">
       Any prospective employer of a health care provider shall, before hiring such health care provider, request in writing that the health care provider’s professional licensing board furnish the prospective employer any notice of termination maintained by the board with respect to the health care provider. The prospective employer shall maintain the confidentiality of such information and shall not disclose it to any other person or entity without the prior written approval of the health care provider or as required by law, court order or the rules of civil procedure. The professional licensing board shall require, as a condition of furnishing the notice of termination, that the prospective employer file a written request for the health care provider’s notice of termination, stating under oath that the request for the notice of termination is made for a bona fide hiring purpose, that the request is made pursuant to the provisions of this section, and that the prospective employer will not disclose the information to any other person or entity without the prior written approval of the health care provider or as required by law, court order or rules of civil procedure. In the event that the prospective employer discloses the information in the notice of termination to any other person or entity in violation of the provisions of this section, and unless the disclosure is required by law, court order or the rules of civil procedure, the health care provider may pursue a civil cause of action against the prospective employer for a breach of the health care provider’s right of privacy. Upon receipt of a request made in accordance with this section for a health care provider’s notice of termination, the professional licensing board shall furnish the notice of termination to the prospective employer. The professional licensing board shall not be held liable for the correctness or completeness of the information contained in the notice of termination and shall include a disclaimer statement on all released information, attesting that the information has not been verified by the professional licensing board. An employer who obtains a notice of termination from the appropriate professional licensing board as provided in this section shall not be held civilly liable for hiring or contracting with a health care provider who the employer in good faith believes has been rehabilitated from drug abuse, absent the employer’s gross negligence or reckless conduct.
    (4) Notices of termination submitted hereunder shall be maintained and available to employers as set forth above for fifteen (15) years from the date of receipt by the professional licensing board.

The director or agent of the department of agriculture of the state of Idaho shall make sanitary inspection of milk, cream, butter and dairy products of any kind whatsoever, intended for human consumption, and of containers, utensils, equipment, buildings, premises or anything whatsoever employed in the production, handling, storing, processing or manufacturing of dairy products or that would affect the purity of the products. Inspections, examinations and tests shall be made to meet the requirements of the laws of the state and of the United States for the sale of the products or their transportation in both intrastate and interstate commerce.

     <ol>
      <li id="t37c03s37-309ol11">
       All milk haulers must possess a permit issued by the state department of agriculture. All milk haulers shall be subject to such examination and abilities as the department of agriculture may prescribe by rule or regulation in order to receive and retain such permit. The fee for the permit shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The permit shall be valid for three (3) years and must be renewed by December 31 of the third year.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c03s37-309ol12">
       The milk line shall be passed through a special port opening through the milk house wall with care to prevent contact with the ground or floor of the milk house. The port opening shall be closed when not in use.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c03s37-309ol13">
       It shall be the responsibility of the milk hauler to assure that in the event the processor washes and sanitizes the truck the operation has been adequately performed, and that prior to use the tank truck has been properly sanitized. In the event it is the milk hauler’s responsibility to sanitize the tank truck, it shall be done with a chlorine solution of proper strength.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c03s37-309ol14">
       The milk hauler’s hands shall be washed immediately before gauging the milk.

      </li>
      <li id="t37c03s37-309ol18">
       After the milk is pumped to the transportation tank the milk conductor tubing shall be capped and returned to the vehicle storage cabinet. Care shall be taken to prevent soiling of the milk line by contact with the milk house floor, operator’s hands or the ground.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c03s37-309ol19">
       The milk hauler shall rinse the farm tank and accessories free of milk with clean water immediately after emptying.

        Where a dairymen’s association and a cattle association filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of Gooding County, Idaho, Ordinance No. 90, which regulated water quality at confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), the supreme court held that Ordinance 90 did not violate Idaho Const., Art. XII, § 2. While<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.42.html#t42c01s42-101" target="_blank">§ 42-101 </a></cite>provided that control over the appropriation of water was vested in the state, local governing board’s had the authority under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c65s67-6537" target="_blank">§ 67-6537 </a></cite>to consider the effect any proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan would have on the water quantity in the area; therefore, regulation of CAFOs by the local government was permitted by this section.

     <p>
      Whenever an inspection of any dairy product is made by the department of agriculture, or whenever permanent or temporary inspectors or employees are used by said department for the purpose of enforcing or promulgating an inspection or sanitary program for any dairy product, the department is authorized to fix, assess and collect or cause to be collected from the dairy processors, fees or assessments for such services when they are performed by such employees or agents of the department, such fees to be on a uniform basis in an amount reasonably necessary to cover the cost of such inspection and the administration of the department of agriculture dairy inspection program; provided, however, that the department shall so adjust the fees to be collected under this section as to meet the expenses necessary for this inspection service only, all of said fees to be used for this purpose alone; and provided further, that in no event shall the fees or assessments exceed four (4) mills per pound of butterfat produced by any dairyman in Idaho or received by processors. All such fees and moneys collected or received by the department, its employees or agents under this act shall be deposited in the “dairy industry and inspection account” which account is hereby created. All moneys coming into said account are hereby appropriated to the department of agriculture to be used in the inspection required by law to be made of the dairy industry and dairy products. The fees and assessments accrued in any given month are due and payable no later than the twentieth day of the following month.

      J. All outside openings shall be screened and self-closing doors shall open outward.
     </p>
     <p>
      K. The truck approach shall be properly graded and surfaced to prevent pooling of water at the point of loading. Adequate artificial light shall be provided to illuminate this area to facilitate loading during hours when natural light is insufficient.

       Suitable facilities, including hot and cold running water, detergent, brushes, sanitizers, and sanitizing equipment, a concrete floor with proper drainage and waste disposal shall be provided for washing and sanitizing of transportation tanks. Unless the truck is to be used within a few hours of the washing operation the sanitizing of the tank shall be omitted until just before the tank truck is to be used. During the interim the tank truck shall be protected from contamination by closing port holes, etc. Since the tank truck may be sanitized on a different date and at a different time from cleaning and washing operation, a tag shall provide space for recording this information. The washing, sanitizing and maintenance of the transportation tank and accessories shall be the responsibility of the processor or milk hauler. The department of agriculture shall be informed in writing designating the person responsible for the cleaning, sanitizing and maintenance of the transportation tank.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c04s37-411C">
       The transportation tank and all accessories shall be thoroughly rinsed after each usage and shall be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized daily and the tank tagged and sealed with a tag attached indicating that the tank has been washed and/or sanitized. This tag shall also contain the name of the person doing the work and the date on which the work was done. The tag shall be removed by the hauler at his first pickup and shall be retained at the receiving plant for a minimum of thirty (30) days.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c04s37-411D">
       Single length, durable, non-toxic, flexible milk conductor tubing shall be used for conveying milk from the farm tank to the transportation tank. The inside diameter of milk conductor tubing shall not be less than one and three-eighths (1 3/8) inches. If two (2) lengths of tubing are used, they shall be connected either by the use of sanitary couplings or a piece of 3A sanitary tubing with clamps which can be removed without tools. The connections between the pump and the vehicle tank, and between the pump and the milk conductor tubing shall remain assembled except when dismantled for cleaning. The open end of the milk tubing shall be capped with an approved protective cap at all times except when loading or unloading. The outlet valve, milk pump and the milk conductor tubing and samples shall be inclosed in a properly drained, insulated, dust tight cabinet.

        The legislature’s classification of cocaine as a narcotic for regulatory and penalty purposes is not in conflict with constitutional principles of due process, equal protection, and cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Cianelli, 101 Idaho 313, 612 P.2d 550 (1980).

       <p>
        An examination of the word “delivery”, as defined pursuant to this section, makes it clear that a defendant need not have been an agent of another to be guilty under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2732" target="_self">§ 37-2732</a></cite>. State v. Sharp, 104 Idaho 691, 662 P.2d 1135 (1983).

       <p>
        A violation of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2732" target="_self">§ 37-2732</a></cite>(a)(1)(B) occurs when a controlled substance is intentionally and unlawfully delivered; it is immaterial that the recipient is an unexpected person. State v. Castillo, 108 Idaho 205, 697 P.2d 1219 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instruction was proper where court advised the jury that they could convict defendant of delivery of cocaine if they found he had “attempted to deliver” cocaine, as the instruction followed the statutory language whereby “deliver” or “delivery” are defined as the actual, constructive or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance, whether or not there is an agency relationship. State v. Bruno, 119 Idaho 199, 804 P.2d 928 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, and that the jury should have been given the definition of “deliver”, asserting that an indirect transfer did not equate to a constructive transfer and that the district court’s instruction lessened the state’s burden of proof; however, the jury was instructed from the pattern Idaho criminal jury instructions, which were presumptively correct. State v. Cuevas-Hernandez, 140 Idaho 373, 93 P.3d 704 (Ct. App. 2004).

        The facts establishing the statutory elements of manufacturing a controlled substance are different from the facts required to prove the elements of possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and separate convictions for these offenses did not violate state and federal constitutional protection against double jeopardy.

        Substance identification is an issue to be decided by the jury, and, where a drug analyst testified at length to the laboratory tests she conducted on the plant material found in defendant’s home and at the end of the testimony concluded that in her opinion each of the evidence envelopes contained marijuana, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury’s verdict.

       <p>
        The definition of marijuana was intended to include those parts of marijuana which contain THC and exclude those parts which do not and was not limited to any particular species of marijuana. State v. Miles, 97 Idaho 396, 545 P.2d 484 (1976), overruled on other grounds, State v. Bottelson, 102 Idaho 90, 625 P.2d 1093 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in holding that the growing of marijuana was within the personal use exception of the manufacturing statutes,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2732" target="_self">§§ 37-2732</a></cite>, 37-2737A, and this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of marijuana in this section is unambiguous and will be interpreted by the court in accordance to its language. State v. Griffith, 130 Idaho 64, 936 P.2d 707 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the definition of marijuana in this section, the state is not required to offer evidence that the material disputed at trial contains THC in order to prove such material is marijuana; but, as the section indicates, if the state does introduce evidence that the material contains THC, it creates a presumption in favor of the state that the material is marijuana. State v. Griffith, 130 Idaho 64, 936 P.2d 707 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where officers discovered approximately one pound of marijuana in the garage at defendant’s home and approximately $151,000 in currency at defendant’s automotive repair shop, the evidence was sufficient to support his felony conviction for possession of marijuana.

    Where the informations separately charging defendant with the two crimes of manufacturing and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance contained no specific factual allegations showing what acts were alleged to be the basis for each respective crime, and since there were no specific references to separate acts committed at different times in order to satisfy the “temporal” test under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c03s18-301" target="_blank">§ 18-301</a></cite>, the district court erred in refusing to dismiss one of the counts against defendant.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a state expert witness began her testing analysis with the assumption that the substance in question, prednisolone, was a drug did not detract from the relevance of the tests performed or the conclusions drawn since, even assuming that a nondrug substance might theoretically give the same test results as prednisolone, the possibility of such an occurrence did not bar the jury from deciding that the evidence presented was convincing enough to persuade them, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the substance was prednisolone.

        Marijuana.
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is a rational relationship between classifying marijuana as a schedule I drug and a legitimate government purpose therefor. Recent changes in the social and legal landscapes do not provide the court a basis upon which to change that classification. The legislature or proper administrative board has that responsibility. State v. Rainier, 159 Idaho 142, 357 P.3d 867 (Ct. App. 2015).

        Punishment of three years probation, 45 days in jail and $1,000 fine was not grossly disproportionate to offense of possession with intent to manufacture, considering the amount of marijuana and paraphernalia seized, nor was it clearly arbitrary and shocking to the sense of justice. State v. Kelly, 106 Idaho 268, 678 P.2d 60 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 918, 105 S. Ct. 296, 83 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1984).

        Because the language of the controlled substances statute is plain and unambiguous, even a trace amount of the substance will satisfy the requirement of the statute, and a refusal to adopt the usable-quantity rule does not lead to a result which is palpably absurd.

       <p>
        The court determined from the testimony of officer that the white envelope containing drug evidence was sealed when it left the officer and that it was sealed in the same way when the criminologist received it. Mere speculation that the evidence was mishandled or tampered with was insufficient to establish a break in the chain of custody. State v. Kodesh, 122 Idaho 756, 838 P.2d 885 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Cocaine.

        The legislature’s classification of cocaine as a narcotic for regulatory and penalty purposes is not in conflict with constitutional principles of due process, equal protection, and cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Cianelli, 101 Idaho 313, 612 P.2d 550 (1980).

       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase “having a stimulant effect on the central nervous system” in subsection (d) of this section modifies the word “substances” not the word “quantity”; had the Idaho legislature intended that a quantitative analysis be required under subsection (d) of this section, the legislature would have set forth required amounts as it did for certain other substances. State v. Troughton, 126 Idaho 406, 884 P.2d 419 (Ct. App. 1994).

       <p>
        Whether or not this section required the state to prove that the methamphetamine which defendant delivered to law enforcement agents had a stimulant effect on the central nervous system, defense counsel admitted at oral argument that he had failed to raise the issue at trial and in such a situation, where the issue was not raised below, the court would not consider it on appeal.

        Quantity.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the legislature did not proscribe the possession of “any quantity” of cocaine as it did for methamphetamine, its classification of cocaine as a Schedule II controlled substance and its limited availability demonstrate that the legislature intended the possession of even trace or residual quantities of cocaine to fall within the scope of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2732" target="_self">§ 37-2732</a></cite>(c). State v. Groce, 133 Idaho 144, 983 P.2d 217 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state need not prove that the amount of a controlled substance possessed was a usable amount. State v. Neal, 155 Idaho 484, 314 P.3d 166 (2013).

        Search Warrant Description.

       <p>
        Although a warrant describes a controlled substance in a certain form, the purpose of the search is not limited to finding the substance in that particular form and the scope of the warrant shall extend to alternate forms of the same substance which are similarly controlled by statute. State v. O’Campo, 103 Idaho 62, 644 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a search warrant on its face authorized police to search for PCP on mint leaves or in a powdered form, but instead the PCP was found in a liquid solution, the controlled substance had not lost its identity; it had merely taken a different form still controlled by this section and remained subject to search. State v. O’Campo, 103 Idaho 62, 644 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1982).

       <p>
        The three concurrent indeterminate five-year sentences for three counts of delivery of a controlled substance, one for each count, involving a presumed confinement for one and two-thirds years, was held reasonable when viewed upon the facts.

        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 108, inserted “and driving while under the influence” in the fourth sentence in subsection (k).
    The 2010 amendment, by ch. 118, updated the section reference in subsection (i) in light of the 2010 amendment of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2701" target="_self">§ 37-2701</a></cite>.

       <p>
        The term “this act” in subsection (f) refers to S.L. 1977, Chapter 185, which is codified only as this section. Probably the reference should be to “this section.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The bracketed insertion in subsection (h) was added by the compiler. At the time that subsection (h) was added to this section in 1983, the referenced penalty in subsection (g) was identical to that now found in paragraph (1) of subsection (g).
       </p>

        Conspiracy.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The essential elements of conspiracy are the existence of an agreement to accomplish an illegal objective, coupled with one or more overt acts in furtherance of the illegal purpose and the requisite intent necessary to commit the underlying substantive offense. State v. Martin, 113 Idaho 461, 745 P.2d 1082 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a conspiracy is shown, there must be evidence linking the defendant with it. State v. Martin, 113 Idaho 461, 745 P.2d 1082 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement to conspire need not be proven directly, but may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. State v. Martin, 113 Idaho 461, 745 P.2d 1082 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant’s wife had been heavily involved in distributing methamphetamine and she pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine, the defendant accompanied his wife on several occasions either to pick up narcotics or to make payments, a witness testified that the defendant had agreed that his wife would sell methamphetamine and that he encouraged and assisted his wife in her activities, at least one recorded conversation revealed that the defendant and his wife had requested an amount significantly more than necessary for personal use, and during a search of the defendant’s residence, police found methamphetamine, the jury reasonably could infer the existence of a conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine and could infer a connection between the defendant and the conspiracy. State v. Martin, 113 Idaho 461, 745 P.2d 1082 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Act in furtherance of conspiracy need be committed by only one member of the conspiracy, and the act is then imputed to all other conspirators. State v. Brown, 113 Idaho 480, 745 P.2d 1101 (Ct. App. 1987), review denied, 116 Idaho 467, 776 P.2d 829 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecution must allege and prove an overt act in order to obtain a conviction for conspiracy to violate subsection (f) of this section. State v. Brown, 113 Idaho 480, 745 P.2d 1101 (Ct. App. 1987), review denied, 116 Idaho 467, 776 P.2d 829 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The overt act requirement to obtaining a conviction under subsection (f) of this section is satisfied by slight evidence, and the act in furtherance of the conspiracy need not itself be criminal. State v. Brown, 113 Idaho 480, 745 P.2d 1101 (Ct. App. 1987), review denied, 116 Idaho 467, 776 P.2d 829 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the telephone calls gave meaning to the conspirators’ other acts of visiting prison and possessing marijuana, the prosecutor’s information, taken as a whole, contained sufficient allegations to satisfy the pleading requirement of an overt act. State v. Brown, 113 Idaho 480, 745 P.2d 1101 (Ct. App. 1987), review denied, 116 Idaho 467, 776 P.2d 829 (1988).

        Where an officer involved in a vehicle search performed at the police station testified that he had extensive experience in drug enforcement, where he stated that, in his opinion, the chemicals and equipment found in the vehicle could be used to manufacture methamphetamine, where the chemicals and equipment were found in a vehicle occupied by defendants, and where the state submitted evidence that in preparation for departure, defendant and co-defendant had left with an empty vehicle and had returned to retrieve another co-defendant with a vehicle loaded with the “stuff,” the state produced sufficient evidence to support the probable inference that there was an agreement between the parties, and the magistrate did not err in finding probable cause to bind defendant over to district court for trial on charges of conspiracy to manufacture a controlled substance. State v. Munhall, 118 Idaho 602, 798 P.2d 61 (Ct. App. 1990). Constitutionality.

        This section, by prohibiting the possession of substances acquired before its effective date, does not unconstitutionally deprive persons of their property without just compensation. State v. Kellogg, 100 Idaho 483, 600 P.2d 787 (1979).

        There is no fundamental right to possess or to grow marijuana, even for personal consumption in the privacy of the home and, under the restrained review test, it was not irrational or arbitrary for the legislature to proscribe its cultivation, even for personal use, and to attach felony penalties for such conduct; accordingly this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2705" target="_self">§ 37-2705 </a></cite>are not unconstitutional. State v. Kelly, 106 Idaho 268, 678 P.2d 60 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 918, 105 S. Ct. 296, 83 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 37-2705 and this section prohibiting the growing and use of marijuana do not violate the prohibitions against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment contained in U.S. Const., Amend.

        Separate convictions for manufacturing a controlled substance and for possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver did not violate constitutional protections against double jeopardy; each crime requires proof of an element not required by the other. State v. Randles, 115 Idaho 611, 768 P.2d 1344 (Ct. App. 1989), aff’d in part, 117 Idaho 344, 787 P.2d 1152 (1990).

       <p>
        In order to prove constructive possession, knowledge of the controlled substance and physical control of the controlled substance must be independently proven beyond a reasonable doubt, by either circumstantial or direct evidence. State v. Rozajewski, 130 Idaho 644, 945 P.2d 1390 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constructive possession of a controlled substance exists where a nexus between the accused and the substance is sufficiently proven so as to give rise to the reasonable inference that the accused was not simply a bystander but, rather, had the power and intent to exercise dominion and control over the substance.

       <p>
        Although defendant may not have been in exclusive possession of her residence — which was occupied by three to ten people when the police arrived — there was substantial evidence to show that she did have exclusive possession of her bedroom — no one was inside, there was women’s and unisex clothing in the room, and a sealed envelope addressed to defendant in a bag in the room. Consequently, there was evidence of circumstances to buttress an inference that defendant knew of and exercised control over the cocaine found in the dresser in what was proven to be her bedroom. State v. Crawford, 130 Idaho 592, 944 P.2d 727 (Ct. App. 1997). Continuous Single Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in a prosecution of defendant for both conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance and for aiding and abetting the delivery of a controlled substance, the evidence showed that everything the defendant did to aid and abet the delivery of the cocaine, he did also in furtherance of the conspiracy, his conduct was one continuous “act,” and, therefore, he could be convicted and sentenced of only one crime but not both. State v. Gallatin, 106 Idaho 564, 682 P.2d 105 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state proved an intent to deliver marijuana as it was being produced by the manufacturing process, but where there was no evidence of an “act” by defendant in committing the crime of possession with intent to deliver that was not also an “act” of manufacturing marijuana, it was double jeopardy to punish defendant for both crimes. State v. Kluss, 125 Idaho 14, 867 P.2d 247 (Ct. App. 1993).

        A violation of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section occurs when a controlled substance is intentionally and unlawfully delivered; it is immaterial that the recipient is an unexpected person. State v. Castillo, 108 Idaho 205, 697 P.2d 1219 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with aiding and abetting the delivery of marijuana, although he did not touch the marijuana, his involvement in the sale was a combination of his presence at the scene and comments he made during the transaction, and, since it was difficult to consider his statements as anything other than counseling the sale and an expression of his intent to see the delivery completed, there was substantial evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant aided and abetted the delivery of the marijuana. State v. Hickman, 119 Idaho 366, 806 P.2d 959 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine was vacated, where the state failed to argue or present any evidence to show that defendant intended to deliver the methamphetamine to a third party. State v. Warburton, 145 Idaho 760, 185 P.3d 272 (2008).

        Where a defendant picked up a package at the airport that the police knew contained methamphetamine, and where the police officer, who did not tell defendant that he was a police officer, told defendant that he knew what was inside the package and would call police unless she gave him a “pinch” of it, such substance was not delivered under duress. Defendant failed to show how her life would be endangered if she had refused to deliver the illegal substance; therefore, trial judge did not err in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss the delivery charge. State v. Kopsa, 126 Idaho 512, 887 P.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant convicted of delivery of controlled substance did not show he sold cocaine under any type of threat, nor that he reasonably believed his life would be endangered if he refused to participate in the transaction, trial court’s denial of requested instruction on the affirmative defense of duress was affirmed.

        Where defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, the fact that he was caught with 394.4 grams of marijuana and 3.828 grams hashish, and testimony of narcotics expert that based on his experience such substances were being held for sale was enough substantial and competent evidence to support conviction. State v. Badger, 96 Idaho 168, 525 P.2d 363 (1974).

       <p>
        Where evidence showed that a search had turned up both marijuana and heroin, and paraphernalia used in connection with both, that defendant admitted knowledge of the marijuana and was found within inches of the heroin, that he denied knowledge of the heroin before the arresting officers were aware of its nature, that papers were found listing the searched premises as the defendant’s address, and where the marijuana and drug-related paraphernalia were found in common areas to which he had access, there was substantial evidence to support his convictions for possession of both drugs.

        Where defendant’s evidence did not contradict the state chemist’s opinion that the capsules contained a controlled substance, i.e., amobarbital and secobarbital, instead, he attempted to discredit the state chemist’s opinion by introducing expert testimony which challenged the reliability of the testing procedures used, such a challenge went only to the weight to be afforded testimony. State v. Kellogg, 100 Idaho 483, 600 P.2d 787 (1979).
    Where the expert testimony showed that the defendant when arrested had in his possession a sufficient quantity of PCP either to prepare more than 800 ordinary packets of solid material, or to distribute some 40 to 70 vials of liquid PCP solution having a total value between $4,000 and $7,000, the evidence afforded a substantial basis for the jury to infer an intent to deliver.

       <p>
        In prosecution for violation for conspiracy to violate this chapter, court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of the co-conspirators’ statements before there was independent proof of the conspiracy for, although not explicit on the record, it was clear that the state “promised” to produce independent proof of the conspiracy, in fact, the district court expressly admitted the testimony upon the condition that the state produce sufficient independent proof of the conspiracy and the court recognized its power to strike those statements if proof was not forthcoming.

        In a prosecution for conspiracy to violate this section, hearsay statements of co-conspirators were properly admitted where a prima facie proof of the conspiracy was presented by independent evidence. Evidence that a co-conspirator arranged a narcotics transaction by calling defendant’s phone number, that narcotics transactions took place at the defendant’s house while he was present, and that a search of defendant’s house revealed packaging and paraphernalia similar to those used by co-conspirators was adequate independent evidence.

        In prosecution for delivery of cocaine, the trial court did not err in admitting drug paraphernalia evidence, even though the defendant was not charged with the paraphernalia violation, because the evidence was clearly relevant to show, if nothing more, that the defendant had the accouterments necessary to deal cocaine. State v. Nelson, 112 Idaho 245, 731 P.2d 788 (Ct. App. 1986), aff’d, 114 Idaho 292, 756 P.2d 409 (1988).

        Verdict on conviction for possession of psilocybin mushrooms with intent to deliver was not supported by substantial evidence since state did not offer evidence which established that defendant, individually, knew of the illegal drugs and that he exercised dominion over them; the state did not meet this requirement since when the police began their search of the car, defendant told the officers that the bag with the mushrooms in it was not his and since, at trial, defendant’s passenger repeatedly declared that he, and not defendant, owned the mushrooms.

        Where the only evidence the police had against defendant at the time of his arrest for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance was that he was with another, whom the police did have probable cause to believe had delivered a controlled substance, defendant’s mere presence was not sufficient to lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe or entertain an honest and strong suspicion that defendant was guilty of conspiring to deliver a controlled substance; the arrest was made without probable cause and was illegal.

        In the absence of information showing that defendant dealt drugs in the past, the magistrate could reasonably conclude that defendant was a drug trafficker and although proof of such facts might have lent additional support to the inference that defendant was involved in drug dealing, its absence does not detract from the inference the magistrate reasonably could draw from the quantity of drugs alone.

        There must be substantial evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that establishes the guilt of each defendant as an individual rather than the collective guilt of two or more persons; the state’s evidence establishing the existence of cultivated marijuana and the status of the defendants as joint owners of the property where some of the marijuana was found did not constitute substantial evidence to uphold the conviction of either defendant individually.

        Where defendant was convicted in district court of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver although none of the drugs were found on defendant’s person, the fact that defendant fled from police into the backyard where cocaine was then found by police in a trash can supports the contention that defendant disposed of the cocaine by placing it into the trash can and the jury could reasonably disbelieve defendant’s story that he never saw the police and was chasing a puppy. Evidence of defendant’s interaction with a drug distributor and the defendant’s possession of marked currency provided to the distributor for purchase of cocaine from defendant further supports the prosecution’s reasonable inference of defendant’s knowledge and control of the substance as necessary to establish constructive possession of cocaine by defendant. State v. Gomez, 126 Idaho 700, 889 P.2d 729 (Ct. App. 1995).
    Evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for possession of methamphetamine where a witness testified that defendant, a passenger, appeared nervous at the scene of an automobile accident, he reached deep into a garbage can, and soon thereafter a police officer found a methamphetamine pipe in the garbage can.

       </h5>
       <p>
        An unconsented police entry into a residential unit, be it a house, apartment, or hotel or motel room, constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; even if the rental period had expired, this does not inevitably terminate the justified privacy expectation. Thus, the district court erred in not suppressing evidence of marijuana plants seized in a warrantless search. State v. Johnson, 108 Idaho 619, 701 P.2d 239 (Ct. App. 1985), aff’d, 110 Idaho 516, 716 P.2d 1288 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officers may only conduct a search of an individual’s home without first obtaining a search warrant where the search is incident to an arrest, in response to exigent circumstances, or where there is proper consent. A lessor who has granted the lessee exclusive possession over a certain area may not, during the period of the tenancy, give an effective consent to a police search of that area; this is so whether the arrangement involves the rental of a house, an apartment, a room in a rooming house, hotel or even a locker. Thus, the landlord’s consent to a police search of the tenant’s apartment was ineffective, and the evidence of marijuana obtained in such warrantless search should have been suppressed. State v. Johnson, 108 Idaho 619, 701 P.2d 239 (Ct. App. 1985), aff’d, 110 Idaho 516, 716 P.2d 1288 (1986).
    The gross weight of the controlled substance seized was more consistent with a dealer amount than a user amount and drug paraphernalia necessary for redistribution would probably be present at the address to which the package containing the controlled substance was mailed; therefore, the officer’s affidavit presented a substantial basis for the magistrate to conclude that probable cause was present to search defendant’s residence for evidence of drug repackaging and records of sale. State v. Wilson, 120 Idaho 643, 818 P.2d 347 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The warrant issued in this case covered only instrumentalities and evidence of drug trafficking and was not issued for the purpose of seizing the contents of the package addressed to defendant and delivered to his residence; therefore, because its execution was neither predicated upon the delivery of the package nor upon the occurrence of any other event, the warrant was not “anticipatory.” State v. Sholes, 120 Idaho 639, 818 P.2d 343 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant’s appeal from an Idaho R. Crim. P. 11 conditional plea of guilty to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver in violation of this section was denied; the defendant was arrested for failure to maintain insurance, in violation of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.49.html#t49c12s49-1229" target="_blank">§ 49-1229 </a></cite>and a subsequent search of his automobile uncovered cocaine and other drug paraphernalia; the defendant sought to suppress the evidence seized, contending that the search of his vehicle was an unconstitutional search and seizure and that the Idaho Constitution provided more protection than afforded by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; the trial court properly denied the suppression motion. State v. Wheaton, 121 Idaho 404, 825 P.2d 501 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where police officers discovered cocaine and scales in the console of defendant’s vehicle, after he was arrested for the misdemeanor charge of operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance, the court of appeals upheld the search and seizure of evidence as a search incident to arrest. State v. Wheaton, 121 Idaho 727, 827 P.2d 1174 (Ct. App. 1991), aff’d, 121 Idaho 723, 827 P.2d 1174 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a casual visitor, defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an apartment that police entered without a warrant; therefore, his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures was not violated, and the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress. State v. Vasquez, 129 Idaho 129, 922 P.2d 426 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for possession of a controlled substance found in patrol car in which defendant was placed after his arrest on an outstanding warrant, defendant’s right against illegal search and seizure were not violated where evidence showed that seizure of defendant did not occur when police officers first arrived at the residence and defendant came out in response of officer’s commands as contended by defendant, but only after defendant was arrested upon an outstanding warrant discovered after an outstanding warrant check was made and defendant was placed in patrol car. State v. Fuentes, 129 Idaho 830, 933 P.2d 119 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>

        The factors to be considered by the magistrate in application for search warrant include the reliability of, and the basis of knowledge of, persons who have supplied information that is related by the affiant or witness. State v. Wilson, 130 Idaho 213, 938 P.2d 1251 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a search is conducted pursuant to a warrant, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that the search was invalid. State v. Wilson, 130 Idaho 213, 938 P.2d 1251 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The affidavit for a search warrant of a law enforcement agent which does not specifically identify each source may, nonetheless, be sufficient to support probable cause if a reader could reasonably infer that the information came from other law enforcement personnel. State v. Wilson, 130 Idaho 213, 938 P.2d 1251 (Ct. App. 1997).
    Since in application for search warrant a common sense reading of postal inspector’s affidavit reasonably identified the sources of his information as other government officials carrying out investigatory or regulatory responsibilities, and since those sources were presumptively reliable, defendant’s challenge to search warrant failed. State v. Wilson, 130 Idaho 213, 938 P.2d 1251 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In application for search warrant where, given a common sense interpretation federal agent’s testimony indicated that her information came from the observations of state and federal law enforcement personnel and postal employees involved in the same investigation and nothing in the evidence presented contradicted the presumption that these sources were reliable, there was a substantial basis for determining that probable cause existed for issuing the search warrant. State v. Wilson, 130 Idaho 213, 938 P.2d 1251 (Ct. App. 1997).

        Because the officer lawfully entered the bedroom to conduct a Type I protective sweep subsequent to defendant’s arrest pursuant to the warrants, and upon entering the bedroom observed, in plain view, the contraband which was the basis of the criminal charges, the evidence was lawfully seized.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence police found when they searched trash cans set near the street that was used to get a search warrant was properly admitted, because there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in items deposited in a public area, conveyed to a third-party for collection, and readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.

        Intent to Deliver.

       <p>
        Where drug enforcement administration expert in narcotics testified that an individual addict would not possess fifteen grams of heroin for personal use and that packaging and purity of the heroin seized at defendant’s residence were consistent with sales activity and inconsistent with mere personal use, the evidence was sufficient to uphold conviction for “intent to deliver.” State v. Gomez, 101 Idaho 802, 623 P.2d 110 (1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 963, 102 S. Ct. 503, 70 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981).

        Evidence of the quantity and variety of controlled substances found will not, by itself, support an inference of intent to deliver a controlled substance under this section. State v. O’Campo, 103 Idaho 62, 644 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where substantial quantities and values of a prohibited substance are combined with evidence of suspicious activities, money, or transaction records, the inference of intent to deliver may be sustained. State v. O’Campo, 103 Idaho 62, 644 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence of drug paraphernalia, even without packaging material, may be sufficient to support an inference of an intent to deliver. State v. O’Campo, 103 Idaho 62, 644 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1982).
    Where the quantity and economic value of the controlled substances suggest personal use, the mere existence of packaging material will not provide an adequate basis to infer an intent to deliver the controlled substance as the packaging may be consistent with the defendant’s purchase of the substances for personal use. State v. O’Campo, 103 Idaho 62, 644 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1982).

       <p>
        Where jury requested that judge define “control” as used in instruction related to possession of marijuana under this section and judge, after unsuccessfully trying to locate defense counsel, conferred with prosecuting attorney and typed out definition for jury, it was harmless error for judge to so act, despite fact that he violated procedure under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c22s19-2204" target="_blank">§ 19-2204</a></cite>, since the information filed against defendant contained the correct definition. State v. Randolph, 102 Idaho 153, 627 P.2d 782 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for delivery of cocaine based entirely on circumstantial evidence, it was reversible error to refuse to give the instruction that a defendant cannot be convicted unless the proved circumstances are not only consistent with guilt but cannot not be reconciled with any other rational conclusion, and that if the evidence is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, one pointing to guilt and the other to innocence, the jury must adopt the interpretation of innocence. State v. Nelson, 112 Idaho 245, 731 P.2d 788 (Ct. App. 1986), aff’d, 114 Idaho 292, 756 P.2d 409 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for delivery of cocaine, it was not error for the court to refuse a requested instruction dealing with drug paraphernalia, as the defendant was not charged with a paraphernalia violation. State v. Nelson, 112 Idaho 245, 731 P.2d 788 (Ct. App. 1986), aff’d, 114 Idaho 292, 756 P.2d 409 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure to give the requested instruction advising the jury to examine a paid informant’s testimony with greater caution than the testimony of ordinary witnesses was at most harmless error, where the informant’s testimony was not the sole or primary evidence against the defendant. State v. Nelson, 112 Idaho 245, 731 P.2d 788 (Ct. App. 1986), aff’d, 114 Idaho 292, 756 P.2d 409 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in prosecution for delivery of cocaine, the defendant never claimed to have delivered any cocaine, the giving of the instruction that the state did not have the burden of proving that the defendant did not have any authority under law to deliver the controlled substances was harmless because the question of the defendant’s authority to deliver was not at issue in the trial. State v. Nelson, 112 Idaho 245, 731 P.2d 788 (Ct. App. 1986), aff’d, 114 Idaho 292, 756 P.2d 409 (1988).
    Where, in prosecution for delivery of cocaine, there was substantial evidence presented to show the state’s theory of the defendant’s involvement in the crime, that evidence fully supported an aiding and abetting instruction. State v. Nelson, 112 Idaho 245, 731 P.2d 788 (Ct. App. 1986), aff’d, 114 Idaho 292, 756 P.2d 409 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in prosecution for delivery of cocaine, the testimony of the defendant’s alibi witness established the defendant’s presence for only part of the evening, the district court did not err in giving the instruction that allowed the jury to make a reasonable doubt determination of whether the defendant was involved in the crime, nor did the court err in refusing to give the defendant’s requested alibi instruction. State v. Nelson, 112 Idaho 245, 731 P.2d 788 (Ct. App. 1986), aff’d, 114 Idaho 292, 756 P.2d 409 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The instruction requested by defendant on possession of paraphernalia only served to suggest a crime that could have been, but was not, directly or indirectly charged. Therefore, the court was not required to give any instruction about the crime of possession of paraphernalia. State v. Kodesh, 122 Idaho 756, 838 P.2d 885 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defense of necessity could not logically have applied to the charged offense of which defendant was found guilty, possession of marijuana with intent to deliver; thus any error in the denial of her requested jury instruction was harmless. State v. Tadlock, 136 Idaho 413, 34 P.3d 1096 (Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for possession of a controlled substance, the state need only prove the defendant’s knowledge that he had a controlled substance in his possession and need not prove that the defendant was aware of the precise type of controlled substance. State v. Stefani, 142 Idaho 698, 132 P.3d 455 (Ct. App. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for possession of amphetamine, defendant was entitled to a new trial due to conflict between oral and written instructions. In light of defense counsel’s focus in closing argument around incorrect standard provided in oral instructions, defendant was prejudiced by correct, but looser, standard provided in written instructions. State v. Amelia, 144 Idaho 332, 160 P.3d 771 (Ct. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an appeal in which the state challenged the propriety of the district court’s jury instruction regarding the elements of possession of a controlled substance under subsection (c), the supreme court concluded there was no need for it to determine if the jury instruction given by the district court was error, because such an error was harmless. State v. Razo-Chavez, 159 Idaho 590, 364 P.3d 291 (2016).

       <p>
        District court erred in denying suppression motion of defendant charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver; the five seconds the police waited after a knock and announce was not a reasonable length of time to allow an occupant of defendant’s home to answer the door in the early morning, when no exigency existed or arose and the alleged volume of drugs in the home was itself insufficient to create reasonable suspicion of an exigency allowing the police to almost immediately enter the home after knocking and announcing.

       <p>
        The mens rea element of the offense of possession of a controlled substance is knowledge of possession, not knowledge that the substance possessed is a controlled substance. State v. Fox, 124 Idaho 924, 866 P.2d 181 (1993).
    Where defendant claimed that he did not know the nature of the residue in the vial that he possessed, not that he did not know the illegal nature of the substance he possessed; testimony of third party was relevant to the issue of knowledge of what the substance was. State v. Lamphere, 130 Idaho 630, 945 P.2d 1 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        To be convicted under this section, an individual need not know that the substance possessed is a controlled substance. State v. Blake, 133 Idaho 237, 985 P.2d 117 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s mistaken belief that the cotton ball in his possession no longer contained any methamphetamine residue did not absolve him of guilt where he earlier knew of and controlled that same methamphetamine residue as part of a larger quantity that he was using. State v. Armstrong, 142 Idaho 62, 122 P.3d 321 (Ct. App. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of probable cause may be met by means of circumstantial evidence supportive of reasonable inferences on the part of the magistrate. For the purposes of determining whether there was probable cause to believe that defendant had possessed methadone, the magistrate judge could reasonably have inferred that defendant consumed the methadone, that defendant possessed it before she consumed it, and that defendant knew it was either methadone or a controlled substance when she was possessing it. State v. Neal, 155 Idaho 484, 314 P.3d 166 (2013).

        Manufacturing and Possession.

       <p>
        This section treats manufacturing as a criminal act distinguishable from delivery or possession with intent to deliver. This is a constitutionally permissible legislative choice. State v. Randles, 115 Idaho 611, 768 P.2d 1344 (Ct. App. 1989), aff’d in part, 117 Idaho 344, 787 P.2d 1152 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The facts establishing the statutory elements of manufacturing a controlled substance are different from the facts required to prove the elements of possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver; manufacturing is completed when a person produces or otherwise prepares the controlled substance. On the other hand, possession with intent to deliver does not require any production, processing or synthesizing of a drug; it is complete upon actual or constructive possession coupled with the intent to transfer, or attempt to transfer, the substance to another person. State v. Randles, 115 Idaho 611, 768 P.2d 1344 (Ct. App. 1989), aff’d in part, 117 Idaho 344, 787 P.2d 1152 (1990).

       <p>
        Growing marijuana plants in a greenhouse was not sufficient to sustain a conviction of manufacture of marijuana against the defendant. State v. Randles, 117 Idaho 344, 787 P.2d 1152 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The facts establishing the statutory elements of manufacturing a controlled substance are different from the facts required to prove the elements of possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and separate convictions for these offenses did not violate state and federal constitutional protection against double jeopardy.

        In prosecution for delivery of a controlled substance, circumstantial evidence that police informant was quite familiar and had a lot of experience with methamphetamine, that he had purchased the drug from defendant on several occasions, that it was packaged in the same manner on such occasions as it was during the transaction in question, that police officer who was listening to informant’s and defendant’s conversation over a listening device confirmed informant’s description of the transaction, was sufficient evidence from which jury could find that the substance defendant delivered to informant was methamphetamine.

        Where, although defendant charged with certain crimes under this section did not have actual possession of the drugs in question, he did have constructive possession, and this was established by evidence that the defendant knew of the drugs and had equal control with co-defendant over the premises in which they were found. State v. Hickman, 119 Idaho 366, 806 P.2d 959 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to establish possession of a controlled substance, a defendant need not have actual physical possession of the substance; the state need only prove that the defendant has such dominion and control over the substance to establish constructive possession. What is crucial to the state’s proof is a sufficient showing of a nexus between the accused and the controlled substance. Knowledge of the existence of controlled substances may be inferred through circumstances. State v. Kopsa, 126 Idaho 512, 887 P.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1994).
    Where defendant was convicted in district court of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver under this section, the fact that defendant received marijuana in the mail in a package addressed to him at a location where he was known to sometimes reside was not sufficient to establish constructive possession of marijuana because it did not warrant an inference beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the drugs knowingly. State v. Gomez, 126 Idaho 700, 889 P.2d 729 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for possessing a controlled substance, methamphetamine, with intent to deliver and failing to affix a controlled substance tax stamp, where friends of defendant testified that he personally used the drug, and there was evidence that the only place that the drug was found in the clubhouse was in the closet filled with defendant’s belongings, that defendant attempted to drive away when he arrived at the clubhouse and saw that a search was being conducted, that he was an officer of the club and frequently approached police as the contact person for the group, that he often resided at the clubhouse and received personal mail there, that he controlled access to the bedroom and kept a list of personal effects there, that he protected the room with firearms, that small bags similar to those used to package the drug were found in the room, that the drug was found on a beam scale in an amount usually kept for personal use but was consistent for an amount intended for sale, taken together these facts were sufficient to support the inferences that defendant knew of the methamphetamine and exercised dominion and control over it by occupying and controlling the room. State v. Seitter, 127 Idaho 370, 900 P.2d 1381 (Ct. App. 1994), rev’d on other grounds, 127 Idaho 356, 900 P.2d 1367 (1995).

        The magistrate’s finding of probable cause was supported by the evidence where cocaine was found both scattered across the seat and floor of defendant’s pickup and in a bindle lying near his feet and the paper used to make the bindle of cocaine was torn from a bank deposit slip bearing defendant’s name and lying under the floor mat of the pickup. From this evidence, a reasonable inference could be drawn that defendant had physically possessed the cocaine and had either dropped the bindle himself or had previously transferred the bindle to his companion.

        Although the legislature did not proscribe the possession of “any quantity” of cocaine as it did for methamphetamine, its classification of cocaine as a Schedule II controlled substance and its limited availability demonstrate that the legislature intended the possession of even trace or residual quantities of cocaine to fall within the scope of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the language of the controlled substances statute is plain and unambiguous, even a trace amount of the substance will satisfy the requirement of the statute, and a refusal to adopt the usable-quantity rule does not lead to a result which is palpably absurd.

       <p>
        The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the indeterminate sentence of not more than three years for delivery of marijuana, where defendant had had numerous brushes with the law prior to the arrest which led to conviction, and although of a relatively minor nature, these gave support to the trial court’s decision to deny the defendant probation at the time of sentencing.

        Defendant confused the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c53s19-5304" target="_blank">§ 19-5304</a></cite>(1) — requiring that a court order a defendant to pay victims for any economic losses directly resulting from the criminal conduct for which the defendant is convicted — with the provisions of subsection (k) of this section — which authorizes the courts to “order restitution for costs incurred by law enforcement agencies in investigating the violation” for which the defendant is convicted; in this case the district court expressly ordered restitution pursuant to the latter statute and thus, contrary to defendant’s claim, the district court had statutory authority, and hence jurisdiction, to order him to pay restitution to the law enforcement agencies. State v. Hernandez, 121 Idaho 114, 822 P.2d 1011 (Ct. App. 1991).
    An order for restitution of costs incurred by law enforcement agencies in investigation is a direct consequence of entering a guilty plea and the sentencing court may not impose restitution upon a defendant who pleads guilty, unless defendant is advised of that possibility prior to entering the plea. State v. Banuelos, 124 Idaho 569, 861 P.2d 1234 (Ct. App. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1098, 114 S. Ct. 936, 127 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court abused its discretion in ordering a defendant, convicted of racketeering for his participation in growing and processing marijuana, to pay restitution to the county for costs of investigating and prosecuting the action against him; as it existed during the period relevant to defendant’s appeal, this section was limited to a conviction of felony violation under this chapter. State v. Hansen, 125 Idaho 927, 877 P.2d 898 (1994) (see 2004 amendment authorizing restitution in misdemeanor cases).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory language of paragraph (k) is broad enough to encompass prosecutorial expenses associated with drug court operations incurred before a judgment of conviction has been entered against the defendant. State v. McCool, 139 Idaho 808, 87 P.3d 295 (Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        A reasonable reading of subsection (k) includes costs incurred for law enforcement employees’ attendance at a restitution hearing and the costs of their investigation. State v. Mosqueda, 150 Idaho 830, 252 P.3d 563 (Ct. App. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c53s19-5304" target="_blank">§ 19-5304</a></cite>, the court properly entered a civil judgment for restitution against a defendant who agreed to plead guilty to two counts of trafficking in cocaine and one count of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, even though there was no mention of restitution in the plea agreement. State v. Gomez, 153 Idaho 253, 281 P.3d 90 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the dismissal of a felony conviction became final after the expiration of the time for appeal or affirmance of the dismissal on appeal, a district court’s jurisdiction to amend the order expired at that time. Jurisdiction was not extended for a motion, seeking reimbursement for restitution already paid to the court, that was filed 10 months after the dismissal. Even assuming the district court had subject matter jurisdiction, it lacked personal jurisdiction over the nonparty agencies that collected, disbursed, or retained the monies paid. State v. Peterson, 153 Idaho 157, 280 P.3d 184 (Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (k) allows an award of restitution for any costs incurred by law enforcement agencies, and law enforcement agencies expressly includes county prosecuting attorney offices. Thus, that provision plainly encompasses restitution for the salaries of prosecutors for their time devoted to particular cases. State v. Cardoza, 155 Idaho 889, 318 P.3d 658 (Ct. App. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court has discretion to deny all or part of the restitution request for an economic loss, including the costs for prosecuting the case. In that regard, the trial court should look to subsection (7) and consider the amount of economic loss sustained by the victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources, needs and earning ability of the defendant, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate. State v. Harer, 160 Idaho 98, 369 P.3d 316 (Ct. App. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (k) does not violate a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to stand trial and present a defense, as it is not premised upon whether he exercised his rights, but is aimed at the legitimate governmental end of recovering prosecution costs. State v. Kelley, 161 Idaho 686, 390 P.3d 412 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (k) does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to equal protection, as it does not distinguish among defendants, but treats equally all defendants who are convicted. State v. Kelley, 161 Idaho 686, 390 P.3d 412 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restitution award was not supported by substantial evidence, where the state’s unsworn statement of costs, submitted as evidence of its prosecution costs, did not even state that restitution was sought only for expenses actually incurred in prosecuting the charge that resulted in the defendant’s conviction, and did not include costs associated with a mistrial, acquittal, or the conviction of defendant’s spouse. State v. Nelson, 161 Idaho 692, 390 P.3d 418 (2017).
    Subsection (k) does not permit recovery of reasonable.prosecution expenses. By its plain terms, it grants the court discretion to award restitution to the state for prosecution expenses actually incurred. State v. Cunningham, 161 Idaho 698, 390 P.3d 424 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restitution under subsection (k) must be based on a preponderance of the evidence. An award of restitution will not be disturbed, if supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. Unsworn representation, even by an officer of the court, does not constitute substantial evidence upon which restitution may be based. State v. Cunningham, 161 Idaho 698, 390 P.3d 424 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court is not statutorily required to articulate its reasoning for declining to award total or partial restitution for prosecution costs; therefore, the articulation of one reason, e.g., defendant’s future limited earning capacity, does not erase all others. State v. Matthews, 164 Idaho 605, 434 P.3d 209 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restitution proceedings under subsection (k) are subject to the general Idaho rules of evidence hearsay rules. State v. Cunningham, 164 Idaho 759, 435 P.3d 539 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in awarding restitution to the state because, although the defendant agreed to pay restitution for investigative and prosecution expenses, the costs associated with the county prosecutor’s office and the city’s police department were not sufficiently presented in the state’s restitution requests. State v. Hess, — Idaho —, — P.3d —, 2020 Ida. App. LEXIS 92 (Ct. App. April 30, 2020).

       <p>
        Search of defendant’s car was proper and supported by probable cause where drug-detection dog used to sniff the exterior indicated the presence of a controlled substance and defendant’s initial detention was proper and did not constitute an arrest without probable cause where, after a proper initial stop due to defendant’s excessive speed, officer acquired information contrary to what defendant had been telling him and became suspicious of objects in the back seat of defendant’s car. State v. Martinez, 129 Idaho 426, 925 P.2d 1125 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine, defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied as he failed to demonstrate that his arrest was unlawfully made in violation of the restrictions on the warrants for his arrest in a public place or in violation of the Fourth Amendment. State v. Shellenbarger, 140 Idaho 185, 90 P.3d 935 (Ct. App. 2004).

        The automobile exception to the warrant requirement justified the search of defendant’s purse following a drug dog’s alert on the vehicle. State v. Easterday, 159 Idaho 173, 357 P.3d 1281 (Ct. App. 2015).

        The officer’s brief questioning and his use of the drug detection dog to sniff the exterior of defendant’s truck did not violate defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights. State v. Parkinson, 135 Idaho 357, 17 P.3d 301 (Ct. App. 2000). — Exigent Circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        The circumstances known to officer immediately before she entered defendant’s apartment — a violent fight in progress with one participant already having been injured, the presence of a small child who could be victimized, and the consequent risk of bodily harm to one or more occupants of the apartment if the police did not intervene — constituted an exigent circumstance that justified officer’s entry for purpose of preventing further violence and rendered discovery of methamphetamine lawful. State v. Sailas, 129 Idaho 432, 925 P.2d 1131 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had just been found unconscious under circumstances suggesting that he was under the influence of drugs, the fact that he was declining treatment did not make unreasonable the paramedics’ belief that he required further attention; therefore, the exigent circumstance had not yet dissipated when police officers entered the motel room while defendant was still on the floor with paramedics continuing to evaluate or treat him, because law enforcement officers may enter premises to seize contraband that was found in plain view by firefighters or other emergency personnel if the exigency is continuing and the emergency personnel are still lawfully present.

        Where there was no evidence to suggest that defendant was uncooperative, that he had a propensity for violence, or that there were suspicious bulges in his clothing, nor did the officer who frisked defendant testify that he had any information prior to the frisk to indicate that defendant was armed, based upon the totality of the circumstances known to the officers on the scene, a reasonably prudent person would have no cause to believe that defendant was armed and dangerous; therefore, the district court erred in determining that the officers were justified in frisking defendant. State v. Kerley, 134 Idaho 870, 11 P.3d 489 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no clear request for consent to search defendant’s home, and it could not be inferred that defendant consented to the officers conducting a search to find items that were not in plain view, the search was unreasonable and defendant’s motion to suppress should have been granted; the court thus vacated defendant’s conviction of possession of methamphetamine. State v. Lafferty, 139 Idaho 336, 79 P.3d 157 (Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for possession of a controlled substance was improper where the evidence found in his wallet should have been suppressed; although a drug dog’s alert to defendant’s vehicle, and subsequent failure of a search of that vehicle to disclose contraband, might have caused the officers’ suspicions to be aroused, the officers could not lawfully arrest him on the basis of their suspicions and could not reasonably conclude that defendant was in possession of drugs. State v. Gibson, 141 Idaho 277, 108 P.3d 424 (Ct. App. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a controlled drug transaction took place at one location in a mobile home park, but a search of that location failed to find any marijuana, and the officer determined that the suspect lived in an adjoining space and obtained a search warrant for that space based solely on the residence of the suspect, the search of the adjoining space was invalid for lack of a nexus between the place to be searched and the item to be seized, and the evidence should have been suppressed.

        Where a police officer intentionally removed all items from a suspect’s pocket, he acted unreasonably and not in a minimally intrusive fashion, and exceeded the scope of a pat-down search for weapons. The baggy of methamphetamine that the officer removed from defendant’s pocket was, therefore, the fruit of an unreasonable search and should have been suppressed. State v. Watson, 143 Idaho 840, 153 P.3d 1186 (Ct. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on a response to a possible burglary, an officer was justified in conducting a

Upon defendant’s admission that he also possessed marijuana, the officer was permitted to reach into defendant’s pocket and remove the marijuana. State v.

        Under the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art.

       </p>
       <p>
        To determine whether probable cause exists in order to issue a search warrant, a magistrate must employ the totality of circumstances standard set forth in
    Illinois v. Gates
    , 402 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983), and make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. State v. Wilson, 130 Idaho 213, 938 P.2d 1251 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>

        A magistrate’s evaluation of probable cause is based on facts set forth in an affidavit or any sworn, recorded testimony given in support of the search warrant. State v. Wilson, 130 Idaho 213, 938 P.2d 1251 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The stop was valid because the facts as found by the district court provided objectively reasonable grounds to support the officer’s suspicion of criminal activity, where the officer responded at night to a reported burglar alarm at a building that the officer was aware had been burglarized and vandalized in the recent past, and defendant was the only person at the scene of the reported alarm other than the officer. State v. Robertson, 134 Idaho 180, 997 P.2d 641 (Ct. App. 2000).
    The affidavit in support of the request for a search warrant contained reliable, nonstale information that an informant had observed growing, harvested, drying and stored marijuana, thus supplying probable cause to the magistrate that a crime was being committed on the property to be searched.

State v. Soto, 127 Idaho 324, 900 P.2d 800 (Ct. App. 1995).

        In prosecution for possession and trafficking of methamphetamine, trial court erred in denying defendants motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of police officer’s entry, along with firefighters, into defendant’s garage after a fire had been put out. There was no exigency that would allow police to follow emergency personnel into the garage without a search warrant, because the firefighters did not find any contraband or evidence of a crime while investigating the fire’s cause and they did not request the assistance of a police officer.

        While police officer’s initial detention of defendant was without reasonable suspicion, it ended when defendant jumped up from picnic table where officer was questioning him and ran.

Had defendant remained at table, however, evidence would have been suppressible. State v. Zuniga, 143 Idaho 431, 146 P.3d 697 (Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where police officers had observed defendant smoking a marijuana cigarette, their statement that defendant would be subject to arrest if he did not turn over what drugs he had did not render defendant’s subsequent consent to search his truck involuntary, as it merely informed defendant of their intention to do something that was within their authority based on the circumstances. State v. Garcia, 143 Idaho 774, 152 P.3d 645 (Ct. App. 2006).

       <p>
        Where the sentence was well within the limits set by the legislature for the punishment of the crime of selling heroin, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to two years in prison although there was a strong showing of rehabilitation made in his favor. State v. Ogata, 95 Idaho 309, 508 P.2d 141 (1973).
    Since the maximum sentence for violation of this section is 15 years [now life] and/or a $25,000 fine, a sentence of 3 years in prison was not an abuse of discretion. State v. O’Bryan, 96 Idaho 548, 531 P.2d 1193 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court in a heroin delivery case to sentence the defendant to an indeterminate period not to exceed eight years pursuant to this section, despite the fact that there was evidence in the record to support mitigation of the punishment, since the record also contained evidence that the defendant was extensively and intentionally involved in the trafficking of heroin and that he was selling extremely pure heroin, which posed the threat of death to the unwary. State v. Gonzales, 102 Idaho 701, 638 P.2d 1390 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant pled guilty to possession with intent to deliver a nonnarcotic drug or substance and the record adequately demonstrated that, prior to sentencing the defendant to the maximum prison sentence permissible, the trial judge closely examined the presentence report, considered six letters submitted on defendant’s behalf, the facts and circumstances of this offense, the defendant’s prior record, the defendant’s previous actions and character, rehabilitation prospects, feasibility of probation, and the interest of society, the trial judge did not clearly abuse his discretion. State v. Couch, 103 Idaho 496, 650 P.2d 638 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was given maximum sentences of five years for offenses of drunk driving and marijuana possession and was not given any reduction for presentence confinement, the term of imprisonment imposed exceeded the statutory maximum. Law v. Rasmussen, 104 Idaho 455, 660 P.2d 67 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Punishment of three years probation, 45 days in jail and $1,000 fine was not grossly disproportionate to offense of possession with intent to manufacture, considering the amount of marijuana and paraphernalia seized, nor was it clearly arbitrary and shocking to the sense of justice. State v. Kelly, 106 Idaho 268, 678 P.2d 60 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 918, 105 S. Ct. 296, 83 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since former<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c03s18-301" target="_blank">§ 18-301 </a></cite>prohibited the trial court from convicting and sentencing the defendant for both conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance and aiding and abetting the delivery arising from the defendant’s continuous course of conduct, the appellate court chose to vacate the delivery conviction and affirm the conspiracy conviction based upon a policy of deterrence arising from enforcement of the crime of conspiracy. State v. Gallatin, 106 Idaho 564, 682 P.2d 105 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy to violate the controlled substance law by selling heroin, district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to an indeterminate 15-year term, for heroin is a schedule I controlled substance, and is a “narcotic drug,” and the maximum penalty for the manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a schedule I narcotic drug is life imprisonment, a $25,000 fine, or both and defendant’s sentence was well within the statutory maximum. State v. Mata, 107 Idaho 863, 693 P.2d 1065 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court possesses discretionary authority to determine an appropriate sentence, within statutory limits. State v. Garza, 109 Idaho 40, 704 P.2d 944 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        A fixed sentence of ten years for a conviction of delivery of heroin was not excessive where the defendant had two prior convictions for similar offenses; the sentencing judge acted within his discretion in determining that substantial confinement was necessary to protect society from the defendant’s repeated drug trafficking. State v. Garza, 109 Idaho 40, 704 P.2d 944 (Ct. App. 1985).
    The defendant’s indeterminate five-year sentence for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver was not an abuse of discretion, where the judge could have reasonably concluded that the defendant’s involvement went beyond the sale of a single ounce of marijuana, and the defendant was later convicted of another crime. State v. Paz, 112 Idaho 407, 732 P.2d 376 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The three concurrent indeterminate five-year sentences for three counts of delivery of a controlled substance, one for each count, involving a presumed confinement for one and two-third years, was held reasonable when viewed upon the facts. State v. Edwards, 113 Idaho 821, 748 P.2d 405 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for unlawful delivery of heroin and cocaine, the judge abused his discretion by pronouncing a 30-year indeterminate sentence and by declining to reduce the sentence when requested to do so pursuant to Idaho R. Crim. P. 35, where the defendant had no prior criminal record and was of good character before his involvement in these drug transactions, and his participation in the transactions was encouraged by offers of large sums of money from government agents; 20 years was the heaviest appropriate sanction. State v. Carrasco, 114 Idaho 348, 757 P.2d 211 (Ct. App. 1988), rev’d on other grounds, 117 Idaho 295, 787 P.2d 281 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for attempted manufacture of methamphetamine, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing the defendant to a fixed 15-year prison term, where he intentionally left the state to avoid the sentence, resulting in the forfeiture of the security which was his mother’s home, he was convicted in subsequent drug-involved crimes, and he was previously involved in a killing. State v. Ballard, 114 Idaho 799, 761 P.2d 1151 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court properly denied a motion for a reduction of sentence by defendant convicted of possession of controlled substance with intent to deliver and of theft by possession of stolen property where defendant was sentenced to concurrent, unified sentences of seven years with three years minimum confinement and of five years with three years minimum confinement, and these sentences were well within the statutorily permitted maximum penalties. State v. Garcia, 115 Idaho 559, 768 P.2d 822 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a unified sentence has been imposed, and where defendant claims that the sentence is excessive, an appellate court examines the minimum period of confinement established by the sentencing court as the probable measure of confinement. State v. Heer, 116 Idaho 969, 783 P.2d 308 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of possessing approximately nine pounds of marijuana with intent to deliver and was sentenced as a persistent violator to 30 years with a 15-year minimum term of confinement, and the sentencing judge wanted to send a “message” to drug traffickers, to law enforcement officers and to the public, as well as wanting to protect society, such “message” sentences must be tailored to the facts at hand, and the goals of protecting society and sending a “message” in this case, where defendant’s prior record involved a long history of criminal offenses, but no violent crimes and no activities in controlled substances other than marijuana, did not require a minimum period of incarceration exceeding ten years. State v. Gauna, 117 Idaho 83, 785 P.2d 647 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary for the court to resort to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c03s37-2739A" target="_self">§ 37-2739A</a></cite> for authority to impose a life sentence as a maximum penalty as the offense with which defendant was charged, delivery of a schedule II controlled substance, carries with it the maximum possible penalty of life imprisonment. State v. Way, 117 Idaho 594, 790 P.2d 375 (Ct. App. 1990).
    A unified sentence of five and one-half years with a one-year minimum confinement period followed by a four and one-half year indeterminate period was not excessive for a conviction of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. State v. Zamora, 118 Idaho 619, 798 P.2d 464 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the sentencing judge imposed a minimum period of confinement of three years for possession of controlled substance with the intent to deliver, the sentence was reasonable where it accomplished the primary objective of protecting society and met any or all of the related goals of deterrence, rehabilitation, or retribution. State v. Huck, 119 Idaho 10, 802 P.2d 1222 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where sentence imposed, an indeterminate term of nine years with a minimum period of three years’ incarceration, was clearly within the statutory maximum of a fixed life sentence and defendant provided no argument showing that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the facts of his case the sentence was upheld. State v. Rodriguez, 118 Idaho 948, 801 P.2d 1299 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, although defendant, convicted of possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana, did not have a prior felony record, he had a significant misdemeanor record which would give some cause for concern about his willingness and ability to be law abiding, where, in addition, the police found nine ounces of cocaine, 16 ounces of marijuana, $11,900 in cash, drug paraphernalia and other evidence of the sale of controlled substances, where defendant admitted to using cocaine on a daily basis for a period of several years, a pattern which the district court characterized as a $100,000 a year habit, and where the district judge found, and the record supported his finding, that defendant was engaged in a regular activity of selling drugs for profit, namely cocaine, the district judge properly determined that the need to protect society warranted a prison term. State v. Christiansen, 119 Idaho 841, 810 P.2d 1127 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a sentence imposed for the delivery charge was twice the length of that given for the possession charge, the sentence was not excessive where court’s comments underscored the seriousness of the menace which drug dealing presents to society, and the need to protect against that harmful activity, and in light of the legislature’s implicit determination that delivery of a controlled substance is the more serious crime, warranting a maximum penalty of life imprisonment compared to the three-year maximum sentence provided for possession. State v. Fuller, 118 Idaho 962, 801 P.2d 1313 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although district judge noted that the defendant had no prior record, had children, and was recently remarried, these factors were outweighed by the fact that her ex-husband, and her friends and acquaintances, used and had dealings with drugs, and the court properly determined that one-year of confinement was the best way to keep the defendant from repeating her crime and from being a further threat to the public and to herself. State v. Marks, 119 Idaho 64, 803 P.2d 565 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the district judge found the defendant was not being fully truthful about her involvement with drugs but was minimizing her drug activities and where defendant’s disregard for orders to appear at court for evaluation further dissuaded the judge from ordering probation initially, the objectives of general deterrence and rehabilitation as stated in the judge’s reasoning satisfied the reasonableness test of the measure of confinement and the sentence of confinement was not an abuse of discretion. State v. Marks, 119 Idaho 64, 803 P.2d 565 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unified sentences of 15 years, with a minimum period of confinement of five years, on two counts of delivery of a controlled substance, heroin, with the sentences to be served concurrently were not unreasonably and excessively harsh and therefore did not constitute an abuse of the court’s sentencing discretion where facts that defendant was 30 years old, divorced with dependent children, was a reliable and hard worker when employed, had no formal education, had considerable familial support and was well liked by his friends, had no prior criminal record had one shoplifting conviction five years earlier and did not smoke, drink or use drugs and expressed contrition and repentance over his involvement with these drug transactions were balanced against the nature of the offense and the protection of the public interest, and the period of incarceration clearly reflect the primary objective of protection of society, and the deterrence both of defendant and other individuals who may be tempted to engage in the distribution of large quantities of heroin or other controlled substances. State v. Baiz, 120 Idaho 292, 815 P.2d 490 (Ct. App. 1991).
    Defendant’s fixed term of two years confinement for delivery of a controlled substance was reasonable in light of the nature of the crimes he committed; the maximum penalty which the district court could have imposed under Idaho law; his character as revealed by his extensive criminal history and the other information contained in his presentence investigation report; and the facts showed that he was a threat to society. State v. Esparza, 120 Idaho 578, 817 P.2d 1102 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court did not abuse its sentencing discretion where it considered defendant’s extensive criminal background of five felonies and one misdemeanor, and emphasized the court’s concern for the protection of society from the harm that could result from his conduct, and the court considered defendant’s drug and alcohol problem. State v. Hoak, 120 Idaho 415, 816 P.2d 371 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The three-year minimum period of confinement imposed by the trial court did not represent an abuse of discretion where defendant was charged with three counts of delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine, based on three separate and substantial transactions involving a total amount in excess of $8,000 despite progress reports that were quite favorable. State v. Hernandez, 121 Idaho 114, 822 P.2d 1011 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant sold heroin on five separate occasions to an undercover officer and, simultaneously with his arrest on these charges, he was also arrested on an outstanding federal warrant for illegal entry into the United States and for possessing heroin and cocaine, unified sentences of 20 years in the custody of the board of correction with minimum periods of confinement of ten years was reasonable. State v. Sanchez, 121 Idaho 124, 822 P.2d 1021 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A unified sentence of seven years in the custody of the board of correction for delivery of a controlled substance with a minimum period of confinement of three years, to be served concurrently with a sentence defendant was already serving, was reasonable where defendant was on parole at the time she committed the offense, had background and marital problems, and had unfortunately allowed herself to fall into a “vicious cycle” of association with drug dealers and users and abusers of drugs. State v. Ochoa, 121 Idaho 536, 826 P.2d 497 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the record revealed that the sentence imposed for the drug possession count was clearly in excess of that provided by this section which limits the period of confinement to a maximum of three years, the Idaho supreme court will not address on appeal a challenge to the legality of a sentence where the trial court was not given an opportunity to consider the issue. State v. Lavy, 121 Idaho 842, 828 P.2d 871 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant received a sentence of a fixed four year term followed by an indeterminate eight year term for manufacturing of illegal drugs, the record indicated that the trial court took into consideration both the seriousness of the crimes and defendant’s unique background, including his education and lack of any criminal record; furthermore, the sentence for the manufacturing count clearly was within the maximum penalty permitted pursuant to this section; consequently, the sentence imposed for the manufacturing count was not unreasonable under the facts of this case and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s plea for leniency. State v. Lavy, 121 Idaho 842, 828 P.2d 871 (1992).
    A unified sentence of nine years with a minimum period of confinement of two years, for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, was not an abuse of discretion, where although the evidence presentence indicated that defendant’s behavior and attitudes were good, and that he was taking advantage of the programs offered at the Idaho state correctional institution, the district court decided not to reduce the sentence imposed because of the magnitude and seriousness of the crime. State v. Brydon, 121 Idaho 890, 828 P.2d 919 (Ct. App. 1992), overruled on other grounds, State v. Tranmer, 135 Idaho 614, 21 P.3d 936 (Ct App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was sentenced to a unified 25 year sentence, with 12 years fixed, for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, a fixed five-year term, to run concurrently, for possession of marijuana in excess of three ounces and in addition, the court imposed maximum fines of $25,000 and $10,000 respectively, the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Fairchild, 121 Idaho 960, 829 P.2d 550 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unified sentences of eight years with minimum periods of confinement of three years on each of two counts of delivery of a controlled substance was not excessive where the primary occupation of the defendant at the time of his arrest was the sale of drugs. State v. Lamas, 121 Idaho 1027, 829 P.2d 1376 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A 10-year term which included a minimum of five-years’ incarceration for delivery of heroin was not an abuse of discretion where defendant was in possession of a .45 caliber pistol when he was arrested, he was a party to three drug transactions, and he purportedly was the one from whom the other two defendants got their drugs. State v. Jardin, 121 Idaho 1030, 829 P.2d 1379 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A unified sentence of six years imprisonment with a minimum period of confinement of three years delivery of heroin, a controlled substance was not an abuse of discretion where defendant had only recently immigrated to the United States and the facts in the presentence report indicated that he was involved in an organized drug distribution syndicate. State v. Pena, 121 Idaho 1032, 829 P.2d 1381 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        An eight-year prison term, with five years fixed, for delivery of heroin was not an abuse of discretion where the district judge rejected defense counsel’s argument that the state could ill afford the costs of incarcerating an illegal alien and the terse comments of the judge in sentencing defendant clearly demonstrated his concern for retribution and for the protection of society from the “poison” being distributed by drug traffickers. State v. Perez, 122 Idaho 1, 830 P.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had been charged with two separate deliveries of heroin and had pled guilty to one count of delivery under an agreement with the state, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the sentence of five to eight years it had previously imposed. State v. Gonzales, 122 Idaho 17, 830 P.2d 528 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant’s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum of life imprisonment, and no contention was made that the sentence was otherwise illegal, the court refused to consider the issue of whether sentence of 10 years minimum confinement and $10,000 fine was unduly harsh for conviction of delivery of a controlled substance, heroin. Ruiz v. State, 122 Idaho 222, 832 P.2d 1157 (Ct. App. 1992).
    The judgment of conviction imposing a unified sentence of five years, including a two-year fixed period of confinement for two counts of delivery of hydromorphone, a controlled substance, was affirmed, where defendant was on parole for a similar crime at the time of the instant offense, and at the time of sentencing was a self-admitted drug addict with an extensive criminal record; although defendant had made an agreement with the prosecutor, whereby certain charges were dismissed and the prosecutor agreed to recommend a lesser sentence, the court was not bound by the sentence recommendation made by the state. State v. Qualls, 122 Idaho 542, 835 P.2d 1353 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant delivered five ounces, approximately 142 grams, of cocaine to an undercover police officer, a sentence of ten years in the custody of the board of correction, including a minimum period of three years’ incarceration, was reasonable. State v. Salgado, 123 Idaho 247, 846 P.2d 249 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s request for a reduction of sentence where defendant’s sentences for drug offenses were reasonable and where defendant committed several disciplinary offenses in prison during the time before the court relinquished jurisdiction. State v. Sapp, 124 Idaho 17, 855 P.2d 478 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was manufacturing and selling methamphetamine, a minimum period of confinement of seven years on each of three charges, to run concurrently, was not unreasonable. State v. Follinus, 124 Idaho 26, 855 P.2d 863 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of forty years with ten years fixed for conspiracy to deliver cocaine was not an abuse of discretion, where defendant admitted to the scope of his involvement with the distribution of drugs in county. State v. Banuelos, 124 Idaho 569, 861 P.2d 1234 (Ct. App. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1098, 114 S. Ct. 936, 127 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of five years and a $5,000 fine for conspiracy to distribute marijuana was not an abuse of discretion, where defendant was heavily involved in drug distribution and refused to fully cooperate with and admit his full involvement to the pre-sentence investigator. State v. Robles-Rivas, 125 Idaho 160, 868 P.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where record did not indicate that district court relied upon unsubstantiated statements offered by the state, yet did indicate that court properly weighed defendant’s previous felony conviction and nature of the instant offense, 10-year sentence, with fixed 2-year term of incarceration, for felony possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, was not unreasonable and was affirmed. State v. Vivian, 129 Idaho 375, 924 P.2d 637 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to a sentence that included a fixed imprisonment term of five years where defendant was charged with delivery of heroin and with being a persistent violator, despite defendant’s contention that the court did not give adequate consideration to his drug addiction. State v. Zamora, 129 Idaho 817, 933 P.2d 106 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the maximum sentence for which the crime to which defendant plead guilty was life imprisonment, defendant had the burden of showing a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court in sentencing him to a fixed imprisonment term of five years. State v. Zamora, 129 Idaho 817, 933 P.2d 106 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence for possession of a controlled substance within 1000 feet of a school of a fixed minimum term of 5 years to be served consecutively to minimum term of sixty days for the substantive offense was proper and by imposing such sentence the court correctly perceived the mandatory nature of the fixed minimum sentence prescribed by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c03s37-2739B" target="_self">§ 37-2739B</a></cite> and the bounds of its sentencing discretion. State v. Ayala, 129 Idaho 911, 935 P.2d 174 (Ct. App. 1996).
    While the sentence of twenty years with five years fixed was one of the longest sentences imposed on a first-time youthful drug offender in the state, it was not so harsh as to be unreasonable under any view of the facts. State v. Chareunsouk, 135 Idaho 1, 13 P.3d 1 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information regarding a defendant’s expressions of political views on the legalization and use of marijuana is relevant to the sentencing decision, for it bears upon the likelihood that the defendant will repeat the crime. State v. Tadlock, 136 Idaho 413, 34 P.3d 1096 (Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no abuse of discretion in a sentence imposed for delivery of methamphetamine, which consisted of a unified prison term of seven years with three years determinate, or in a district court’s decision not to reduce defendant’s possession of methamphetamine sentence upon revocation of probation, because (1) at the time of sentencing, defendant had a twenty-year history of criminal offenses relating to alcohol and drug abuse; (2) before the instant offenses, defendant had been convicted three times for driving under the influence, once for unlawfully obtaining a legend drug by fraud, and twice for possession of methamphetamine, in addition to numerous theft offenses; and (3) while on probation for possession of methamphetamine, defendant engaged in the business of selling that drug to others. State v. McCarthy, 145 Idaho 397, 179 P.3d 360 (Ct. App. 2008).

        Where defendant served his entire prison term following a sentence for possession of methamphetamine in violation of this section, state’s jurisdictional challenge to lower court decision was moot since outcome would have no effect on defendant. State v. Barclay, 149 Idaho 6, 232 P.3d 327 (2010).

        Where the district court did not order defendant’s deportation, but merely made a provision conditioning the suspension of his sentence upon the likely event that he would be deported by a proper federal authority, conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver was affirmed; such provision in a sentence is not an abuse of judicial discretion.

        Where the informations separately charging defendant with the two crimes of manufacturing and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance contained no specific factual allegations showing what acts were alleged to be the basis for each respective crime, and since there were no specific references to separate acts committed at different times in order to satisfy the “temporal” test under former<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c03s18-301" target="_blank">§ 18-301</a></cite>, the district court erred in refusing to dismiss one of the counts against defendant.

        It is immaterial when a controlled substance was acquired, for the offense is the unauthorized possession of a controlled substance, without regard to the time the substance was acquired. State v. Kellogg, 100 Idaho 483, 600 P.2d 787 (1979).

        This section does not provide a penalty for the acquisition of controlled substances prior to the effective date of the act, rather, the penalty it imposes is for continuing to possess a controlled substance after the act’s effective date. State v. Kellogg, 100 Idaho 483, 600 P.2d 787 (1979).
    The law itself by classification of marijuana as a drug not used for medicinal purposes, negates the burden on the state to prove absence of a prescription. State v. Segovia, 93 Idaho 208, 457 P.2d 905 (1969) (see<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2745" target="_self">§ 37-2745</a></cite>).

        This section was amended by two 1995 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 58, § 1, in subdivision (a)(2)(A) added “two hundred” preceding “(200) grams” and in subsection (a)(7) in the first sentence added “the” following “adjudication of guilt or” and added “or execution” preceding “of sentence shall not”.
    The 1995 amendment, by ch. 103, § 1, in subdivision (a) (1) (A) deleted “in excess of” following “is” and added “or more” preceding “but not less than five”; in subdivision (a) (2) (A) added “two hundred” preceding “(200) grams”; in subdivision (a) (5) (C) substituted “fifteen (15)” for “twenty-five (25)” following “mandatory minimum fixed term of imprisonment of”; in subsection (a) (7) in the first sentence deleted “, except as provided in subsection (a) (8) of this section” following “prescribed in this section” and deleted subsection (a) (8).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 245, in the last paragraph of subsection (5), inserted “in the quantities specified in paragraphs (A) through (F) of this subsection (5)” and added the last sentence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section, after its 1995 amendment which deleted the provision allowing the mandatory sentence to be reduced upon the motion of the prosecuting attorney, fully compiles with the requirement of<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. V,</cite> § 13 that mandatory sentences shall not be reduced and, therefore, such section is constitutional. State v. Puetz, 129 Idaho 842, 934 P.2d 15 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendment to Idaho Const., Art. IV, § 13, effectively circumscribed the power of the courts to suspend a mandatory minimum sentence contained in a statute enacted pursuant to the authority of the constitution; therefore, subsection (a)(7) [now (a)(8)] of this section does not violate the constitution. State v. Pena-Reyes, 131 Idaho 656, 962 P.2d 1040 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is not unconstitutional in that it does not impermissibly abrogate the inherent authority of the courts to suspend sentences, as that authority has been effectively circumscribed by<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. V,</cite> § 13; nor does it deny due process because there is no element of intent, as the legislature elected not to make intent an element of the offense. State v. Rogerson, 132 Idaho 53, 966 P.2d 53 (Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute is not unconstitutionally vague because the definition of marijuana plant is clear; it means plants with a root structure attached. State v. Schumacher, 136 Idaho 509, 37 P.3d 6 (Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory fine for trafficking in controlled substances under paragraph (a)(3) was a mandatory sentence imposed by that section and authorized by the Idaho Constitution; therefore, because the Idaho supreme court had upheld the legislative power to mandate minimum sentences, and treated mandatory minimum fines as part of the sentences, the fines, as part of the sentences, did not create a separation of powers violation under the<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. V, § 13.</cite> State v. Alexander, 138 Idaho 18, 56 P.3d 780 (Ct. App. 2002).

        Where, even if an information had not fully informed defendant of the charge which he had to defend against, trafficking in methamphetamine by manufacturing, a violation of paragraph (a)(3), the preliminary hearing evidence established that defendant was given notice of how the state intended to present its case, and the evidence which had to be refuted at trial; consequently, defendant could not claim prejudice to his defense, and his due process challenge failed. State v. Dorsey, 139 Idaho 149, 75 P.3d 203 (Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        State did not violate defendant’s due process rights by destroying the hazardous portions of the methamphetamine lab because it was not done in bad faith and the police had no reason to believe that the presence or absence of fingerprints on the lab equipment would have potentially exculpatory value.

        Where a defendant picked up a package at the airport that the police knew contained methamphetamine, and where the police officer, who did not tell defendant that he was a police officer, told defendant that he knew what was inside the package and would call police unless she gave him a “pinch” of it, such substance was not delivered under duress for defendant failed to show how her life would be endangered if she had refused to deliver the illegal substance; therefore, trial judge did not err in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss the delivery charge. State v. Kopsa, 126 Idaho 512, 887 P.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1994). Enhanced Sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The plain language of paragraph (7) clearly demonstrates that, if it is established at the time of sentencing that the conviction for which the defendant is being sentenced is the second trafficking conviction for the defendant, the sentencing court shall apply a mandatory minimum fixed term that is twice what is otherwise required. The plain language does not require that the arrest for the second trafficking offense occur after a defendant’s first trafficking conviction. State v. Beavers, 152 Idaho 180, 268 P.3d 1 (Ct. App. 2010).

        Where defendant picked up a package at the airport that the police knew contained methamphetamine, action of the police officer, who did not tell defendant that he was a police officer, in telling defendant that he knew what was inside the package and would call police unless she gave him a “pinch” of it, was not entrapment since the ruse was not to convince an innocent citizen to commit a crime, but to discover whether defendant knew that the package sent to her contained methamphetamine, and as such, it served as a legitimate method of ferreting out a crime. State v. Kopsa, 126 Idaho 512, 887 P.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant challenged the description in instruction of the predisposition element of entrapment, that defendant “was not ready and willing to commit the crime of trafficking in methamphetamine before the law enforcement officials spoke” with defendant. However, the instruction called upon the jury to determine whether defendant was predisposed to commit the charged offense “without the actions” of the state or its agent and did not mislead the jury or prejudice defendant. State v. Henry, 138 Idaho 364, 63 P.3d 490 (Ct. App. 2003).

        Because the classification of persons convicted of trafficking in a controlled substance is neither a suspect classification nor an invidiously discriminatory classification, the rational basis test is used in claims of equal protection violation.

        In prosecution for delivery of and trafficking in methamphetamine, evidence, that defendant sent two money orders, both for substantial amounts, to the identical person in a city within the same week that two packages were sent from fictitious people and addresses and delivered to defendant through an airline from the same city, made it more probable that defendant was engaged in trafficking methamphetamine and, thus, such evidence was relevant; however, the trial court’s conclusion that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by its unfair prejudice was not an abuse of discretion and such evidence was properly admitted. State v. Kopsa, 126 Idaho 512, 887 P.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction for trafficking by attempted manufacture of methamphetamine where police found hundreds of pseudoephedrine tablets, lithium batteries, and anhydrous ammonia in defendant’s home. State v. Swader, 137 Idaho 733, 52 P.3d 878 (Ct. App. 2002).
    In defendant’s drug case, the state’s evidence showing that defendant manufactured or possessed over 2500 grams of a substance that contained methamphetamine was sufficient to support the jury’s finding that defendant violated paragraph (a)(3)(C) [now (a)(4)(C)] by manufacturing or possessing 400 grams or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine. State v. Palmer, 138 Idaho 931, 71 P.3d 1078 (Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support jury’s verdict of guilty of aiding and abetting trafficking in cocaine and aiding and abetting failure to affix illegal drug tax stamps where defendant arranged for the sale of cocaine to a confidential informant and accompanied him to the drug dealer’s residence where the sale took place. State v. Romero-Garcia, 139 Idaho 199, 75 P.3d 1209 (Ct. App. 2003).

        Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, and that the jury should have been given the definition of “deliver” contained within<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2701" target="_self">§ 37-2701</a></cite>, asserting that an indirect transfer did not equate to a constructive transfer and that the district court’s instruction lessened the state’s burden of proof; however, the jury was instructed from the pattern Idaho criminal jury instructions, which were presumptively correct. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. State v. Cuevas-Hernandez, 140 Idaho 373, 93 P.3d 704 (Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Note written by defendant’s co-conspirator to the co-conspirator’s girlfriend, showing that the co-conspirator was attempting to cover up the crime by dissuading his girlfriend from divulging information to police, was not hearsay; although the note was offered in error under Idaho Evid. R. 801(d)(2)(E), such error was harmless because the note was admissible on other grounds. State v. Harris, 141 Idaho 721, 117 P.3d 135 (Ct. App. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the district court erred by creating the impression that only a general intent was required to find defendant guilty of conspiracy to traffic in controlled substances, the error was harmless, because there was overwhelming evidence that defendant was an active participant in the group, including: (1) a co-conspirator’s testimony that defendant was the group’s boss; (2) the high level of phone contact between defendant’s two phones and his co-conspirators’ phones; (3) when defendant was arrested, officers found inside his vehicle the titles of several of the vehicles used by his co-conspirators in the drug operation; (4) officers watched defendant visiting several of the residences from which the co-conspirators were known to operate and in which drugs, cash, and other paraphernalia were later found; and (5) a document linking the drug operation to Utah, where defendant lived, that provided a breakdown of the drugs transported from Utah. State v. Rolon, 146 Idaho 684, 201 P.3d 657 (Ct. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported defendant’s conviction for aiding and abetting trafficking in methamphetamine, because the state provided evidence that the principal represented to an undercover officer that the principal was selling 28 grams or more of methamphetamine to the officer, defendant admitted in an interview to being present to offer protection to the principal in both transactions in which the principal sold methamphetamine to the officer, and defendant was paid by the principal in previously marked bills.

        It was not error for an information to have charged defendant with both manufacture and attempted manufacture of methamphetamine in the same count of the information, because the statute enumerated a series of acts either of which, separately or all together, could constitute the offense, and all of such acts could have been set forth and charged in a single count.

        There was no prosecutorial misconduct where prosecutor reiterated what the district court had already instructed, that the state bears the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt and that defendant has no obligation to present evidence; the prosecutor stated that criminal defendants had those and a number of other rights.

        In defendant’s drug case, because there was overwhelming evidence that methamphetamine had been manufactured in the house, any prosecutorial misstatement of the law during closing was harmless. The jury instructions provided a proper statement of the law and the jury had been instructed to disregard arguments or statements of counsel that were not based on evidence or the law. State v.

        It was permissible for the state to establish trafficking under subsection (a)(3) [now (a)(4)] of this section by adding together quantities of methamphetamine found in package received by defendant and in can found in defendant’s car. State v. Kopsa, 126 Idaho 512, 887 P.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for trafficking in methamphetamine which according to subdivision (a)(3) [now (a)(4)] requires possession of at least 28 grams, where package received by defendant contained 27.02 grams and STP can located in defendant’s car contained 6.8 grams, since the can was in defendant’s car and she had just received a package containing a substantial amount of methamphetamine, the same substance as that contained in the can, and although defendant took the package to her car before delivering a sample to an undercover police officer, the package was found unopened in the car indicating that she had extracted the sample from another source within her car, jury could find that defendant had sufficient dominion and control over the can and its contents; thus, trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on the trafficking charge. State v. Kopsa, 126 Idaho 512, 887 P.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1994).
    Under subsections (a)(3) [now (a)(4)] and (c), a defendant may be convicted of trafficking in methamphetamine if the defendant represented the weight of the delivered substance to be twenty-eight grams or more, even if the actual weight was less; therefore, the evidence presented to the jury, showing that defendant represented the amount sold to be one ounce — which is more than 28 grams — was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction. State v. Escobar, 134 Idaho 387, 3 P.3d 65 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony that defendant represented that the weight of a quantity of methamphetamine was one ounce was, as a matter of law, testimony that the defendant represented that the weight of the methamphetamine was more than 28 grams; one ounce equals 28.35 grams under federal law. There is no requirement that the represented weight be expressed in the wording of the statute. State v. Lemmons, 158 Idaho 971, 354 P.3d 1186 (2015).

        Based upon the seriousness of the offense, the evidence of defendant’s character, and the danger of reoffense that he presented, a unified life sentence with a seven and one-half year determinate term of incarceration and a $ 50,000 fine was not an abuse of the district court’s sentencing discretion.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s unified sentences of 15 years, with 5 years determinate, were not excessive, as defendant had two prior drug convictions and those sentences had not been enough to deter him from committing additional drug-related crimes. State v. Harris, 141 Idaho 721, 117 P.3d 135 (Ct. App. 2005).

        Defendant’s 10-year sentence, with a minimum period of confinement of three years, for trafficking in methamphetamine was appropriate. Although sentence was for a first time felony, it fell well within the minimum of three years and the maximum of life mandated by the provisions of this section for trafficking. State v. Dewitt, 153 Idaho 658, 289 P.3d 60 (Ct. App. 2012).
    In a case involving trafficking in methamphetamine, an argument that a sentence was excessive was rejected, because the district court acted within the boundaries of its discretion in sentencing defendant to a unified term of 10 years, with 4 years fixed. The district court considered the nature of the offense and character of the offender, and the mitigating and aggravating factors and the objectives of protecting society and achieving deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution or punishment. The record also showed that the defendant was actively involved in distributing large amounts of methamphetamine in the community. State v. McIntosh, 160 Idaho 1, 368 P.3d 621 (2016).

        Because the officer lawfully entered the bedroom to conduct a Type I protective sweep subsequent to defendant’s arrest pursuant to the warrants, and upon entering the bedroom observed, in plain view, the contraband which was the basis of the criminal charges, the evidence was lawfully seized. State v. Northover, 133 Idaho 655, 991 P.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of defendant’s prior drug use was admissible because it was not presented to show his character or to show that he acted in conformity with a particular trait of character, rather, the challenged evidence was relevant to prove the specific intent element of the charged offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. State v. Williams, 134 Idaho 590, 6 P.3d 840 (Ct. App. 2000).

        Motion to suppress the evidence was denied where the officer had two warrants for defendant’s arrest and defendant failed to prove that the police officer’s actions of entering the curtilage and looking into the lighted basement window were unreasonable. State v. Northover, 133 Idaho 655, 991 P.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had just been found unconscious under circumstances suggesting that he was under the influence of drugs, the fact that he was declining treatment did not make unreasonable the paramedics’ belief that he required further attention; therefore, the exigent circumstance had not yet dissipated when police officers entered the motel room while defendant was still on the floor with paramedics continuing to evaluate or treat him, because law enforcement officers may enter premises to seize contraband that was found in plain view by firefighters or other emergency personnel if the exigency is continuing and the emergency personnel are still lawfully present. State v. Bower, 135 Idaho 554, 21 P.3d 491 (Ct. App. 2001).
    Evidence of drug paraphernalia was not suppressible on the ground that the seizing officer illegally entered defendant’s home because the officer did not derive this evidence from any exploitation of the unlawful entry; rather, it was found in a search incident to an arrest for battery of the officer and, thus, was not “fruit of the poisonous tree.” State v. Lusby, 146 Idaho 506, 198 P.3d 735 (Ct. App. 2008).

       <p>
        Possession of drug paraphernalia is not a “lesser included offense” of the crime of possession of cocaine. The instruction requested by defendant on possession of paraphernalia only served to suggest a crime that could have been, but was not, directly or indirectly charged. Therefore, the court was not required to give any instruction about the crime of possession of paraphernalia. State v. Kodesh, 122 Idaho 756, 838 P.2d 885 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        An instruction requiring the state to prove not only that the defendant possessed paraphernalia while in the state of Idaho, but also that he intended to use that paraphernalia to introduce a controlled substance into the body, is an accurate statement of the law State v.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2738ol11">
       Any person who pleads guilty to, is found guilty of or has a judgment of conviction entered upon a violation of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (e) of section 37-2732, Idaho Code, shall be sentenced according to the criteria set forth herein.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2738ol12">
       Prior to sentencing for a violation enumerated in subsection (1) of this section, the defendant shall undergo, at his own expense (or at county expense through the procedures set forth in chapters 34 and 35, title 31, Idaho Code), a substance abuse evaluation at a facility approved by the Idaho department of health and welfare. Provided however, if the defendant has no prior or pending charges under the provisions of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (e) of section 37-2732, Idaho Code, and the court does not have any reason to believe that the defendant regularly abuses drugs and is in need of treatment, the court may, in its discretion, waive the evaluation with respect to sentencing for a violation of subsection (b), (c)(3), or (e) of section 37-2732, Idaho Code, and proceed to sentence the defendant. The court may also, in its discretion, waive the requirement of a substance abuse evaluation with respect to a defendant’s violation of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (e) of section 37-2732, Idaho Code, and proceed to sentence the defendant if the court has a presentence investigation report, substance abuse assessment, criminogenic risk assessment, or similar assessment which has evaluated the defendant’s need for substance abuse treatment conducted within twelve (12) months preceding the date of the defendant’s sentencing.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2738ol13">
       In the event a substance abuse evaluation indicates the need for substance abuse treatment, the evaluation shall recommend an appropriate treatment program, together with the estimated costs thereof, and recommendations for other suitable alternative treatment programs, together with the estimated costs thereof. The person shall request that a copy of the completed evaluation be forwarded to the court. The court shall take the evaluation into consideration to determine an appropriate sentence. If a copy of the completed evaluation has not been provided to the court, the court may proceed to sentence the defendant; however, in such event it shall be presumed that substance abuse treatment is needed unless it is shown by a preponderance of evidence that treatment is not required. If the defendant has not made a good faith effort to provide the completed copy of the evaluation to the court, the court may consider the failure of the defendant to provide or report an aggravating circumstance in determining an appropriate sentence. If treatment is ordered, the person or facility performing the evaluation shall not be the person or facility that provides the treatment, unless this requirement is waived by the sentencing court, and with the exception of federally recognized Indian tribes or federal military installations where diagnoses and treatment are appropriate and available. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the use of funds authorized pursuant to the provisions of chapter 3, title 39, Idaho Code, for court ordered substance abuse treatment for indigent defendants.

        </li>

         The sentencing court has an abiding conviction that the defendant will successfully complete the terms of probation; and

      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The requirements for the granting of a withheld judgment pursuant to this subsection shall not apply to a defendant who has been admitted to a problem solving court program approved by the drug court and mental health court coordinating committee and is participating in, or about to begin participating in, such a program, or who participated in such a problem solving court program in connection with the pending case and who successfully graduated from such a program prior to sentencing.

        This section places the burden of getting a substance abuse evaluation, and providing a copy to the court, squarely on the shoulders of the defendant, but does not empower a defendant to prevent sentencing indefinitely by declining to obtain or furnish an evaluation to the court.

        Since the judiciary does not have the “inherent power” to withhold judgments, then any such power conferred on the courts by the legislature may be abrogated by statute. Thus, a withheld sentence that does not meet the standards of this section is invalid and must be corrected under the state’s motion. State v. Branson, 128 Idaho 790, 919 P.2d 319 (1996).

      § 37-2739B. Fixed minimum sentences in drug cases.
     </h3>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t37c27s37-2739Bol1a">
       The legislature intends to allow fixed minimum sentences for certain aggravating factors found in cases brought under the uniform controlled substances act. The legislature hereby finds and declares that trafficking in controlled substances in the state of Idaho is a primary contributor to a societal problem that causes loss of life, personal injury and theft of property, and exacts a tremendous toll on the citizens of this state. To afford better protection to our citizens from those who traffic in controlled substances, the fixed minimum sentencing contained in subsections (b) and (c) of this section is enacted. By enacting fixed minimum sentences, the legislature does not seek to limit a court’s power to impose a greater sentence pursuant to section 19-2513, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2739Bol1b">
       Any person who is found guilty of violating the provisions of section 37-2732(a)(1)(A), Idaho Code, or of any attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime, may be sentenced to a fixed minimum term of confinement to the custody of the state board of correction, which term shall be at least five (5) years and may extend to life, for each of the following aggravating factors found by the trier of fact:
       <ol>
        <li id="t37c27s37-2739Bol1b1">
         That the defendant has previously been found guilty of or convicted of a violation of section 37-2732(a)(1)(A), Idaho Code, or of an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime, or an offense committed in another jurisdiction which, if committed in this jurisdiction, would be punishable as a violation of section 37-2732(a)(1)(A), Idaho Code, or as an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense.
        </li>
        <li id="t37c27s37-2739Bol1b2">
         That the violation occurred on or within one thousand (1,000) feet of the property of any public or private primary or secondary school, or in those portions of any building, park, stadium or other structure or grounds which were, at the time of the violation, being used for an activity sponsored by or through such a school.
        </li>
        <li id="t37c27s37-2739Bol1b3">
         That the violation consisted of the delivery or attempted delivery of a controlled substance to a minor child under the age of eighteen (18) years.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2739Bol1c">
       The fixed minimum terms provided in this section may be imposed where the aggravating factors are separately charged in the information or indictment and admitted by the accused or found to be true by the trier of fact at the trial of the substantive crime; provided, however, that the prosecutor shall give notice to the defendant of intent to seek a fixed penalty at least fourteen (14) days prior to trial. During a fixed minimum term of confinement imposed under this section, the offender shall not be eligible for parole or discharge or credit or reduction of sentence for good conduct except for meritorious service. Each fixed minimum term imposed shall be served consecutively to the others, and consecutively to any minimum term of confinement imposed for the substantive offense.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2739Bol1d">
       Any person who is found guilty of violating the provisions of section 37-2732(a)(1)(A), Idaho Code, or of any attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime, and who is sentenced to serve at least one (1) minimum term of confinement under this section, may be fined an amount up to twice that otherwise provided for the substantive offense.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with a single crime of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver subject to an enhanced penalty,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c17s19-1719" target="_blank">§ 19-1719 </a></cite>did not apply.

       <p>
        Since the intent of the legislature in enacting this section clearly was to provide for an enhanced minimum term of confinement as a penalty upon the commission of drug offenses within 1000 feet of schools, defendant’s claim, that since possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c27s37-2732" target="_self">§ 37-2732</a></cite>(a)(1)(A), is a lesser included offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1000 feet of a school, this section, and he was convicted of both charges he suffered multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of double jeopardy protection, must fail.

       <p>
        Since information charged that defendant possessed a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1000 feet of a private, primary or secondary school, there was no need for the state to produce any evidence with respect to the school property other than as to its location and the distance between that location and where defendant possessed the controlled substance and was not required to prove that the school was in use when he possessed the substance. State v. Ayala, 129 Idaho 911, 935 P.2d 174 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support conviction of possession of controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1000 feet of a primary or secondary school where police officer testified as to measurements he had taken from the alley behind the house where the car containing the controlled substance was located to the property of the primary school and that such measurements showed that the offense was committed within the 1000 feet distance set forth in the statute.

        Where defendant pled guilty to two counts of delivery of a controlled substance and one aggravating factor for having a prior conviction for delivery of a controlled substance, the court properly sentenced defendant to a unified term of fifteen years on the first count of delivery of a controlled substance, including a fixed minimum term of five years for the prior conviction enhancement, and a unified term of fifteen years, with five years fixed, for the second count. This section requires a fixed minimum term of confinement; the district court is without power to suspend the sentence, withhold judgment, or retain jurisdiction State v.

The subpoena shall be served on the utility as in civil actions. The court may, upon motion timely made and in any event before the time specified for compliance with the subpoena, condition compliance upon advancement by the attorney general or prosecuting attorney of the reasonable costs of producing the records specified in the subpoena.

       Except as provided in this subsection, a utility served with a subpoena under this section may disclose to the customer the fact that a subpoena seeking records relating to the customer has been served.

        This section was amended by two 1994 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both 1994 amendments substituted “lienholder” for “lien holder” throughout subsection (d)(3)(D)(IV), in subsection (e)(2)(A) substituted “including, but not limited to,” for “including but not limited to” and in the first sentence of subsection (f)(2) inserted “the” following “surrendered under”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1994 amendment, by ch. 285, § 1, also added subsection (a)(9).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1994 amendment, by ch. 286, § 1, also inserted “or appropriate prosecuting attorney” following “director” throughout the section; in paragraph (d)(3)(D)(IV)(ii)2.C., added “or to the appropriate prosecuting attorney for credit to the local drug enforcement donation account, or its equivalent.”; in subsection (e)(2)(A) substituted “prosecuting attorney on behalf of the” for “by the director, to his agent” following “To the director or”; and deleted former paragraph (e)(4) which read “Upon the recommendation of the director only, the court may order property forfeited, in whole or in part, to a city or county the law enforcement agency of which participated in the events leading to the seizure of the property. Upon such order, the city or county shall use the property for drug enforcement purposes consistent with this act.”.
    The 2009 amendment, by ch. 108, in subsections (d)(3)(D)(IV)(ii)2C. and (e)(2)(C), inserted “and driving while under the influence.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2014 amendment, by ch. 78, substituted “Idaho state police by a representative” for “supervisory drug analyst of the Idaho state police, a representative” in the second sentence in paragraph (f)(2).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 221, substituted “used in the commission of an act prohibited by section 37-2732B, 37-2732(a) or (b), or 37-2737A, Idaho Code” for “described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this section” in paragraph (a)(3); substituted “or manufacture of substances as prohibited by section 37-2732B, 37-2732(a) or (b), or 37-2737A, Idaho Code” for “possession or concealment, for the purpose of distribution or receipt of property described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this section” in the introductory paragraph of paragraph (a)(4); added the last paragraph in subsection (b); in subsection (d), rewrote the first sentence in the introductory paragraph, which formerly read: “Property taken or detained under this section shall not be subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of the director, or appropriate prosecuting attorney, subject only to the orders and decrees of the district court, or magistrate’s division thereof, having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceedings” and added the second and third sentences; in paragraph (d)(2), inserted “or (9)” in the first sentence, rewrote the third sentence, which formerly read: “The court shall order the property forfeited to the director, or appropriate prosecuting attorney, if he determines that such property was used, or intended for use, in violation of this chapter, or, in the case of items described in paragraph (6)(A) of subsection (a), was found in close proximity to property described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (5), (7) or (8) of subsection (a) of this section”, and added the last three sentences; substituted “forfeiture because he did not know” for “forfeiture because he could not have known in the exercise of reasonable diligence” in paragraph (d)(3)(D)(II); deleted the former last sentence in paragraph (d)(3)(D)(IV)(i), which read: “The court may order payment of all costs incurred by the state or law enforcement agency as a result of such seizure”; rewrote paragraph (e)(1), which formerly read: “Retain it for official use”; and added subsection (j).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2020 amendment, by ch. 14, deleted “and a representative of the state board of pharmacy” from the end of the first sentence in paragraph (f)(2).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A forfeiture proceeding pursuant to this section is a civil action prosecuted against the seized property; generally, the responding claimant challenging the forfeiture action is the owner of the seized property and, with the exception of special procedural rules directing the manner in which notice is given and the appropriate manner for a claimant to respond, the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure apply to forfeiture proceedings. Richardson v. One 1972 GMC Pickup, 121 Idaho 599, 826 P.2d 1311 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Idaho department of law enforcement (department) brought action against defendant for forfeiture of defendant’s personal property under this section, after entry of judgment against defendant and prior to defendant’s motion to set aside the judgment, the property was transferred to the county; since the civil forfeiture statutes did not authorize the department to bring a forfeiture action in its own name as representative of, and for the benefit of another governmental entity and as forfeiture proceedings were governed by Idaho R. Civ. P. 17, forfeiture actions must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, which in this case was the county. As such, in the event of reversal of the forfeiture judgment and remand to the district court, the county could be joined as a party plaintiff pursuant to Idaho R. Civ. P. 19 and the department’s argument that defendant’s appeal should be dismissed as moot as the property of the action was no longer in the department’s control would be obviated by proper pleading. State Dep’t of Law Enforcement ex rel. Cade v. One 1990 Geo Metro, 126 Idaho 675, 889 P.2d 109 (Ct. App. 1995).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a civil forfeiture case, because a county filed a plainly untimely complaint and unreasonably resisted a motion to dismiss the action, an award of attorney fees was proper. The county’s reliance on a mandatory/directory analysis relating to the word “shall” in paragraph (c)(3) was not reasonable and did not enable the county to avoid liability for attorney fees. Bonner County v. Cunningham, 156 Idaho 291, 323 P.3d 1252 (Ct. App. 2014).

       <p>
        Since the legislature may have intended to provide the state with a 30-day period, under this section, to prepare its case, a literal reading of the requirement of subdivision (d)(3)(D) of this section requiring a hearing to be set not “less” than 30 days after filing a verified answer would not necessarily be irrational or absurd and the provision must be interpreted as written. State, Dep’t of Law Enforcement v. One 1955 Willys Jeep, 100 Idaho 150, 595 P.2d 299 (1979), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

        In context of criminal forfeiture, the words “such violation” in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c28s37-2801" target="_self">§ 37-2801</a></cite>(2), plainly refer to the specific violation of which a defendant has been found guilty; in this respect,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t37c28s37-2801" target="_self">§ 37-2801</a></cite>(2), which is a criminal forfeiture statute, differs significantly from the civil forfeiture provision within this section. State v. Stevens, 139 Idaho 670, 84 P.3d 1038 (Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition of excessive fines under U.S. Const., Amend. VIII limits forfeitures made pursuant to this section. Nez Perce County Prosecuting Atty. v. Reese, 142 Idaho 893, 136 P.3d 364 (Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a civil forfeiture action, the state must prove that the vehicle at issue was involved the “distribution or receipt” of controlled substances and must prove that element by a preponderance of the evidence. Ada County Prosecuting Atty. v. 2007 Legendary Motorcycle, 154 Idaho 351, 298 P.3d 245 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred by ordering the civil forfeiture of an owner’s vehicle, after the owner pleaded guilty to delivery of a controlled substance and the owner’s spouse pleaded guilty to manufacturing a controlled substance, after marijuana was found in the vehicle, because the prosecutor failed to establish that the vehicle was used for the purpose of distribution or receipt of a controlled substance.

       <p>
        Where forfeiture of currency required findings both of close proximity to controlled substances and use or intention for use in violation of law, a forfeiture judgment based solely on a finding of proximity was error, and the action was remanded for further findings. State ex rel. Rooney v. One 1977 Subaru Two Door, 114 Idaho 43, 753 P.2d 254 (1988) (decision prior to 1986 amendment).

       <p>
        In light of recent precedent from the United States supreme court, this section does not create forfeiture proceedings which are criminal in nature or which result in punishment for double jeopardy. State v. McGough, 129 Idaho 371, 924 P.2d 633 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the U.S. supreme court recently determined that civil forfeitures in general, and specifically in cases involving money laundering and drug statutes, do not constitute “punishment” for purposes of the double jeopardy clause, there was no double jeopardy attached to defendant’s convictions and sentences for delivery of controlled substance, money laundering, and failure to pay income tax and the prior forfeiture of his property under this section. State v. Ross, 129 Idaho 380, 924 P.2d 1224 (1996).
    Defendant’s conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver was not barred by the doctrine of double jeopardy due to the prior civil forfeiture of his property in an action brought under this section, since the United States supreme court in
    United States v. Ursery
    , 518 U.S. 267, 116 S. Ct. 2135, 135 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1996) declared that civil forfeiture in general, and specifically in cases involving drug statutes, do not constitute punishment for purposes of double jeopardy. State v. Ayala, 129 Idaho 911, 935 P.2d 174 (Ct. App. 1996).

        The mere fact that property is seized illegally does not immunize it from forfeiture.

        In 1986 the legislature amended this section adopting what appears to be a “per se” rule of mandatory forfeiture of money or property found in close proximity to contraband controlled substances, without the necessity of finding that the money was used or intended for use in violation of the act. State ex rel. Rooney v. One 1977 Subaru Two Door, 114 Idaho 43, 753 P.2d 254 (1988).
    District court erred in granting involuntary dismissal of a county’s civil forfeiture claim, where it established that the aggrieved individual made three large deposits into his bank account in the months leading up to his arrest, he was unemployed on the day he was arrested, he had made a number of large cash withdrawals from the account that were approximately equal to the value of the methamphetamine he possessed upon his arrest, and he used the account for a restaurant purchase on the same day he was meeting with his supplier. That evidence tended to show that the bank funds were more likely than not used or intended for use in connection with drug trafficking. Ada County Prosecuting Atty. v.

        Where a claimant’s motor home and a travel trailer were forfeited based on the nature of marijuana-growing operation, the claimant’s culpability, and the connection between the conveyances and the operation, a finding that the forfeiture was not disproportionate to the claimant’s drug trafficking offense was improper since the proportionality analysis failed to consider the monetary value of the conveyances and their character as the residence of the claimant and the claimant’s spouse, economic hardship to the claimant and third parties, penalties authorized by the legislature, and factors for determining the gravity of the claimant’s offense.

     </h3>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t37c27s37-2744Aol1a">
       Any real property, including any interest therein and any appurtenances thereto or improvements thereon, which is used in any manner or part, to commit or to facilitate the commission of a violation of the provisions of this chapter punishable by more than one (1) year of imprisonment, shall be subject to forfeiture under the provisions of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2744Aol1b">
       Property subject to forfeiture under the provisions of this section may be seized by the director upon determining that a parcel of property is subject to forfeiture, by filing a notice of forfeiture with the recorder of the county in which the property or any part thereof is situated. The notice must contain a legal description of the property sought to be forfeited; provided, however, that in the event the property sought to be forfeited is part of a greater parcel, the director may, for the purposes of this notice, use the legal description of the greater parcel. The director shall also send by certified mail a copy of the notice of forfeiture to any persons holding a recorded interest or of whose interest the director has actual knowledge. The director shall post a similar copy of the notice conspicuously upon the property and publish a copy thereof once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks immediately following the seizure in a newspaper published in the county. The owner or party in lawful possession of the property sought to be forfeited may retain possession and use thereof and may collect and keep income from the property while the forfeiture proceedings are pending.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2744Aol1c">
       In the event of a seizure pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a complaint instituting forfeiture proceedings under subsection (d) of this section shall be filed in the district court in the county in which the real property is situated within ninety (90) days of the date of seizure. The complaint shall be served in the same manner as other complaints subject to the Idaho rules of civil procedure on all persons having an interest in the real property sought to be forfeited.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c27s37-2744Aol1d">
       Real property sought to be forfeited under the provisions of this section shall not be subject to an action for detainer or any other collateral action, but is deemed to be in the custody of the director subject only to the orders and decrees of the district court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceedings. Forfeiture proceedings shall be civil proceedings in which the burden of proof shall be on the director to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property sought to be forfeited is subject to forfeiture. Upon being satisfied that an owner or claimant as defined in paragraph (4) of this subsection should not be subjected to forfeiture because that person had no knowledge or reason to believe that the real property was being used or had been used for the purposes alleged by the department, the director shall release the property to the owner or other claimant. The procedure applicable to such cases shall be the same as that prescribed by the Idaho rules of civil procedure. Following service the director may, where appropriate, seek default judgment pursuant to the Idaho rules of civil procedure. If an answer is filed the court shall proceed to set the case for hearing before the court without a jury.
       <ol>
        <li id="t37c27s37-2744Aol1d1">
         Following the hearing, if the court finds that the property is subject to forfeiture pursuant to subsection (a) of this section the court shall order the property forfeited to the director and title shall vest as of the date of the original seizure.

         Any owner who has an answer on file may show by competent evidence that his interest in the property sought to be forfeited is not subject to forfeiture because he could not have known in the exercise of reasonable diligence that the real property was being used, or had been used in any manner in violation of the provisions of this section. If the court finds that the property was not used in violation of the provisions of this section or is not subject to forfeiture under the provisions of this section, the court shall order the property released to the owner.

      The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to chapter 27, title 37, Idaho Code, that the person forfeit to the state of Idaho all property described in this section. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed or interpreted in any manner to prevent the state of Idaho, attorney general or the appropriate prosecuting attorney from requesting restitution pursuant to section 37-2732(k), Idaho Code; or, if appropriate, from pursuing civil forfeiture pursuant to section 37-2744 and/or section 37-2744A, Idaho Code. Nor shall an order of forfeiture pursuant to this chapter be used as an offset against, or in any manner be used to diminish the amount of, a restitution order under section 37-2732(k), Idaho Code. The issue of criminal forfeiture shall be for the court alone, without submission to a jury, as a part of the sentencing procedure within the criminal action.

If the court determines that there is probable cause to believe that the property to be seized would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture and that an order under subsection (1) of this section may not be sufficient to assure the availability of the property for forfeiture, the court shall issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property by the appropriate law enforcement agency upon such terms and conditions as the court shall deem proper.

Any income accruing to or derived from property subject to forfeiture under this chapter may be used to offset ordinary and necessary expenses to the property which are required by law, or which are necessary to protect the interests of the state of Idaho or third parties.
