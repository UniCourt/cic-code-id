        In reviewing an order holding a party in contempt of court, while the reviewing court may not weigh the evidence, it has the right to examine the record to determine whether there is any substantial evidence to support the order of the trial court; for if there is a lack of evidence, then the trial court would have acted in excess of its jurisdiction.

        A “writ of review” brings up the record of the tribunal, board, or body whose acts are to be examined and is issued for reviewing the law applicable to the case, instead of examining the facts of the case, except as an examination of the facts is necessary in the determination of jurisdiction; the purpose of the review is to determine primarily the law applicable to the case rather than the facts of the case.

        Where writ of review is asked upon ground that judge of district court had exceeded his jurisdiction in hearing and determining cause at chambers, and the return, which contains a copy of court record, shows that cause was heard and determined at a regular term, writ will be discharged.

        Certiorari and not mandate is the proper remedy to review and correct an order of the district court quashing a jury panel made in excess of jurisdiction. Heitman v. Morgan, 10 Idaho 562, 79 P. 225 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of review is not a remedy for correcting errors and mistakes of judgment or for purpose of reviewing facts upon which inferior tribunal, board, or officer acted, but its province is limited to a review of questions of law, confined to the specific question as to whether or not the action complained of was in excess of jurisdiction conferred on tribunal, board, or officer.

        Error of law or fact committed by inferior tribunal within the limits of its jurisdiction does not constitute an excess of its jurisdiction. Beus v. Terrell, 46 Idaho 635, 269 P. 593 (1928).
    Sole issue in determination of writ of review is whether the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in making disputed order. Specialty Sales, Inc. v. Graf, 73 Idaho 113, 245 P.2d 820 (1952).

       </p>
       <p>
        On a petition for writ of review, the sole question before the court was whether the district court acted within its jurisdiction in finding the petitioner in contempt for violation of a previously issued injunction and whether substantial competent evidence supported the court’s findings; the fact that the proceeding resulted from a contempt adjudication did not change that standard of review.

        On the original writ of review in the supreme court to review the action of the Governor in removing a commissioner of the Idaho fish and game commission, inquiry is limited to whether the charges filed against the commissioner constitute charges of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or misconduct in office, and whether there was any evidence adduced to support the charges sustained by the order of removal. Hawley v. Bottolfsen, 61 Idaho 101, 98 P.2d 634 (1940).

        Where a bondholder has a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy for the collection of principal or interest due from property owners who have failed to pay assessments made by the city authorities on property within a special improvement district, a writ of mandamus may not be resorted to for the collection of the bonded indebtedness and interest thereon.

        Where, through fault of the city clerk, the assessment roll, standing as security for the payment of special or local improvement district bonds, was inadequate, bondholders’ only adequate relief was to have the property in the district exclusive of lots sold for general taxes and reassessed for payment of deficit, with interest from the date of the maturity of the bonds.

        When a plain official duty, requiring no exercise of discretion, is to be performed, and performance is refused, any person who will sustain personal injury by such refusal may have mandamus to compel its performance; and when such duty is threatened to be violated by some positive official act, any person who will sustain personal injury thereby, for which adequate compensation cannot be had at law, may have injunction to prevent it; in such cases, writs of mandamus and injunction are somewhat correlative to each other.

        It should appear in order for a mandamus to issue from the applicatory affidavit and proofs: First, that a duty is imposed upon defendant that it is sought to have him fulfill; second, that plaintiff has the right to demand performance of that duty; third, that legal demand has been made accompanied with a payment or tender of whatever is required as a concomitant of the demand imposed by law; fourth, that defendant has the ability to comply without impairing rights of nonparty, third persons; fifth, that defendant has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy otherwise.

        Where under the facts the granting of the bank charter by defendant commissioner was purely a ministerial act, the writ of mandamus would be properly issued, defendant having determined that banking corporators had complied with all statutory provisions required to entitle such bank to engage in banking, stockholders and officers were of such character and general fitness as to command confidence in the community, the additional bank was justified in that area, such bank was entitled lawfully to commence business in the community, and stockholders would command confidence in the community.

        Where county commissioners refused to perform ministerial duty to contribute their share of funds to public health district as required by statute, which would diminish ability of public health district to furnish services and reduce its matching funds from state, writ of mandate was properly issued to require commissioners to appropriate and pay required sum, since the public health district had no speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

        Where a criminal case was dismissed and refiled, no writ of mandamus to require the judge to dismiss the case or reassign it to the original magistrate would issue since defendants were not precluded from their normal right to appeal and would not be subjected to any hardships exceeding those ordinarily borne by a defendant in a criminal prosecution.

        Where an agency petitioned for a writ of mandamus to require agency officials to sign a resolution for the issuance of certain bonds, and to proceed to publish notice and execute the bonds, since the agency had available to it other adequate remedies at law and sufficient time within which to pursue those remedies, all mandamus relief requested by the agency could have been accomplished at the district court level by a declaratory judgment action or in other proceedings, and the petition for issuance of a writ of mandamus was denied.

        Where an agency simply alleged in its verified petition for a writ of mandamus that, if agency officials do not sign a resolution for the issuance of certain bonds and proceed to publish notice and execute the bonds, the urban renewal project to be funded by such bonds cannot be completed, and that the will of the citizens would be thwarted, and there was no proof to support the agency’s assertion that it had no other plain, speedy or adequate remedy, the agency failed to prove that a writ of mandamus was its only adequate remedy under the circumstances; the law requires more than conclusions and allegations to warrant the issuance of such a writ, and the petition for issuance of a writ of mandamus was denied.

        In answer to respondents’ contention that since they had no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law, a writ of mandate must issue, the court set forth that it had repeatedly held that mandamus is not a writ of right and that the allowance or refusal of such writ is a matter of discretion with the court before whom the application for it is heard.

        If a citizen has a right to a writ of mandamus to compel a public officer to perform a statutory public duty and a concurrent right of action against a private individual, even if it would in a measure redress the private injury to himself, he is entitled to resort to mandamus.

        The standard of review in a request for writ of mandate to compel reinstatement following a teacher termination by a school board is limited to an examination of whether the party seeking the writ has a clear legal right to have an act performed, and whether the action basically is ministerial, not discretionary; if it is discretionary, mandamus will not lie unless it clearly appears that the board has acted arbitrarily, unjustly and in abuse of its discretion and there is not available any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

        The application for writ of habeas corpus did not show the petitioner to be unlawfully imprisoned or restrained in light of the established facts that he failed to file a tax return containing the required verification or certification and such failure to file a return with a proper verification or certification constituted a refusal and failure to obey a writ of mandate without just excuse and justified his imprisonment pursuant to this section until the writ was obeyed; accordingly, the application for a writ of habeas corpus would be denied. Mitchell v. Agents of State, 105 Idaho 419, 670 P.2d 520 (1983).

        A writ of prohibition to prevent proceedings before a district court or the judge thereof will not be issued in any case unless it is so clear that such court or judge is acting outside of or beyond its or his jurisdiction that there is no reasonable doubt. In re Miller, 4 Idaho 711, 43 P. 870 (1896).

       <p>
        Writ of prohibition is extraordinary remedy which is sometimes granted, not as matter of right but in sound discretion of court, to restrain inferior tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction; where inferior court has jurisdiction expressly conferred upon it by statute, supreme court will not presume in advance that such court will exceed its jurisdiction. Since it is an extraordinary writ, it will not issue in doubtful cases, nor in any case where a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy of law exists. And where it appears that the act sought to be prohibited may speedily be reviewed in supreme court by appeal from order of inferior tribunal, or if appeal will not lie then upon writ of error or certiorari, writ of prohibition will not issue. Rust v. Stewart, 7 Idaho 558, 64 P. 222 (1901).

        Writ of prohibition as authorized by the constitution and laws of this state is the writ as known and recognized at common law. Stein v. Morrison, 9 Idaho 426, 75 P. 246 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The writ of prohibition will not issue to restrain purely ministerial acts. Stein v. Morrison, 9 Idaho 426, 75 P. 246 (1904); Taylor v. Girard, 54 Idaho 787, 36 P.2d 773 (1934).

        This section must be construed with<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c04s7-402" target="_blank">§ 7-402</a></cite>, and, when so construed, it is clear that two contingencies must arise before writ of prohibition will issue, namely, that the tribunal, corporation, board, or person is proceeding without or in excess of jurisdiction of such tribunal, corporation, board or person, and that there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy of law. Olden v. Paxton, 27 Idaho 597, 150 P. 40 (1915); Taylor v. Girard, 54 Idaho 787, 36 P.2d 773 (1934); Roark v. Koelsch, 62 Idaho 626, 115 P.2d 95 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no part of the office of a writ of prohibition to perform the true function of appeal; it does not concern itself with the correction of errors or irregularities of a tribunal so long as that tribunal is acting within its lawful jurisdiction, although it may be improperly exercising such jurisdiction; and when the inquiry is made and answered as to whether or not an inferior court or tribunal has jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the person, the true function of a writ has been performed. Gropp v. Huyette, 35 Idaho 683, 208 P. 848 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of prohibition is used to arrest proceedings involving lack of or excess of jurisdiction and not to attack errors committed in exercise of jurisdiction. Gasper v. District Court, 74 Idaho 388, 264 P.2d 679 (1953).
    A writ of prohibition may be granted if the proceedings of the court are without or in excess of its jurisdiction. Hubbard v. Morse, 76 Idaho 494, 285 P.2d 483 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        A special prosecuting attorney did not become a party to civil action involving party seeking discovery by petitioning district court for protective order to prevent inquiry into certain aspects of criminal investigation during taking of depositions; therefore, a writ of prohibition rather than an appeal was the proper remedy to prevent enforcement of district court’s assessment of discovery costs against special prosecuting attorney. Frost v. Hofmeister, 97 Idaho 757, 554 P.2d 935 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The writ of prohibition serves a fundamental but narrow purpose of determining whether a body whose action is challenged was attempting to act without or in excess of its jurisdiction. Clark v. Meehl, 98 Idaho 641, 570 P.2d 1331 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        A writ of prohibition was not an available means of relief for property owners against a hospital district for levying taxes. Idaho County Property Owners Ass’n v. Syringa Gen. Hosp. Dist., 119 Idaho 309, 805 P.2d 1233 (1991).

        The standard of review for an appeal of the dismissal of a petition for writ of prohibition is the same as the summary judgment standard. All facts and inferences from the record will be viewed in favor of the nonmoving party to determine whether the motion should be granted. Rim View Trout Co. v.

       <p>
        Before a writ of prohibition will issue to an inferior court, it must appear both that the inferior court is proceeding without or in excess of its jurisdiction and that there is not a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Smith v. Young, 71 Idaho 31, 225 P.2d 466 (1950); Freiburghaus v. Freiburghaus, 100 Idaho 730, 604 P.2d 1209 (1980).
    A writ of prohibition may be granted if the proceedings of the court are without or in excess of its jurisdiction. Hubbard v. Morse, 76 Idaho 494, 285 P.2d 483 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court has jurisdiction to issue extraordinary writs in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, and a writ of prohibition is available to arrest the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board or person, when such proceedings are without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such tribunal, corporation, board or person.

Hubbard v. Morse, 76 Idaho 494, 285 P.2d 483 (1955).
    The district court acted within its jurisdiction in finding divorced wife in contempt for refusing her divorced husband his reasonable child visitation rights, so that writ of prohibition was improperly sought, improvidently issued and was quashed since such a writ is to issue only when a court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and no other adequate remedy exists.

        Where a party seeking discovery moved the district court to assess discovery costs against special prosecutor, who had petitioned the district court for protective order to prevent inquiry into certain aspects of criminal investigation, a writ of prohibition would not be issued against the party seeking discovery who exercised no judicial or quasi-judicial power but who was merely a private citizen attempting to use the courts.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a criminal case was dismissed and refiled, no writ of prohibition would issue to require the trial judge to dismiss the case or reassign it to the original magistrate since the magistrate clearly had jurisdiction of the case. Rufener v. Shaud, 98 Idaho 823, 573 P.2d 142 (1977).

P. 82(c)(2) and a rule of the third judicial circuit, lawyer magistrate had subject matter jurisdiction in divorce action, where after holding a hearing on the matter he found that a common-law marriage existed and ordered defendant to pay alimony pendente lite and attorney fees, district court erred in issuing writ of prohibition forbidding any further action by the magistrate in the proceedings. Freiburghaus v. Freiburghaus, 100 Idaho 730, 604 P.2d 1209 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        State was not entitled to a writ of prohibition to enjoin a district court from assessing fees for a special master against the state because the appointment of special masters and the assessment of special master costs were matters within the discretion of the district courts. Clear statutory authority existed for the award of such fees, as well direction as to how costs awarded against the state were to be paid. State v. District Court, 143 Idaho 695, 152 P.3d 566 (2007).

        Writ of prohibition will not issue to restrain judge from holding court at a certain place, on ground that act purporting to create county of which place is the county seat is unconstitutional, where petitioner has no interest in question of the constitutionality of such act, but his interest depends on his being litigant in case pending in court of such judge, and no reason is apparent from the petition why case in which he is interested cannot as well be tried at place in question as at any other place.

        The supreme court cannot anticipate error or that a trial court, board or commission will exceed its jurisdiction and thereupon take jurisdiction before that court has heard and determined the matter which it has jurisdiction to hear and determine, and where the act sought to be prohibited may speedily be reviewed in the supreme court by appeal from the order of the inferior tribunal, or if an appeal will not lie, then upon a writ of error or certiorari the writ of prohibition will not issue. In re Miller, 4 Idaho 711, 43 P. 870 (1896); Rust v. Stewart, 7 Idaho 558, 64 P. 222 (1901); Olden v. Paxton, 27 Idaho 597, 150 P. 40 (1915); Skeen v.

        A writ of prohibition will be issued upon proper complaint or petition to arrest proceedings which are without or in excess of the jurisdiction of a tribunal, corporation, board or person, in all cases where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Cronan v. District Court, 15 Idaho 184, 96 P. 768 (1908); Little v. Broxon, 31 Idaho 303, 170 P. 918 (1918); Evans v. District Court, 47 Idaho 267, 275 P. 99 (1929); State ex rel. Bank of Eagle v.

        Under the statute making a homestead subject to execution in satisfaction of a judgment obtained on a debt secured by a materialman’s lien, the court, in decreeing the foreclosure of such lien and in issuing a writ of assistance directing the sheriff to place the holder of sheriff’s deed in possession, was not subject to writ of prohibition.

       </p>
       <p>
        A right of appeal is regarded as a plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law in the absence of a showing of exceptional circumstances or of the inadequacy of an appeal to protest existing rights, and it never was the intention or meaning of this section that writs of prohibition should take the place of appeals. Smith v. Young, 71 Idaho 31, 225 P.2d 466 (1950).
    Before a writ of prohibition will issue to an inferior court, it must appear both that the inferior court is proceeding without or in excess of its jurisdiction and that there is not a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

        Where the petitioners sought to prohibit county boards from interfering with the assessor’s office but there was no showing that they had attempted to appeal from the actions complained of, the petitioners did not establish lack of an adequate remedy at law and no writ of prohibition would issue. Clark v. Ada County Bd. of Comm’rs, 98 Idaho 749, 572 P.2d 501 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a criminal case was dismissed and refiled no writ of prohibition would issue to require the trial judge to dismiss the case or reassign it to the original magistrate since defendants were not precluded from their normal right to appeal and would not be subjected to any hardships exceeding those ordinarily borne by a defendant in a criminal prosecution. Rufener v. Shaud, 98 Idaho 823, 573 P.2d 142 (1977).

        Plaintiff who had been ordered by the department of water resources to install measuring and recording devices on rim of plaintiff’s water diversion of creek had statutory appeals process available to it when district court dismissed its petition for writ of prohibition against department and since the right to an appeal, although unexercised and since expired, was an adequate remedy at law and the issues raised in the petition were the same ones that could have been brought in a petition for judicial review, dismissal of petition was proper. Rim View Trout Co. v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Resources, 119 Idaho 676, 809 P.2d 1155 (1991).
       </p>

        Idaho department of land’s motion to dismiss the attorney general’s writ of prohibition was granted, as there was a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, such that an extraordinary writ of prohibition would be improper. Injunctive relief would be at least as effective as issuance of the writ, if not more so. State v. Idaho State Bd. of Land Comm’rs (In re Verified Petition), 150 Idaho 547, 249 P.3d 346 (2010).

        Contempt is not proper proceeding to determine issue when person not party to judgment sets up bona fide claim to title of property involved in such judgment. Greene v. Edgington, 37 Idaho 1, 214 P. 751 (1923).

        In a case where the mother granted her consent to her 17-year-old child’s marriage, but the father did not, the district court erred in affirming the magistrate’s judgment holding the mother in contempt for violating the order modifying custody, because the order did not clearly and unequivocally prohibit the mother from consenting to the child’s marriage.

       <p>
        Because of the criminal nature of a contempt proceeding, a person charged with contempt under this section is entitled to certain procedural due process protections before the court can impose sanctions: he is entitled to notice of the exact charges against him, proof that he had knowledge of the terms of the court’s order that he was alleged to have violated, notice of the sanctions which might be imposed against him (fine or jail term), and a trial or hearing on the charges raised. Ross v. Coleman Co., 114 Idaho 817, 761 P.2d 1169 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order to show cause is not fatally defective if it does not contain notice of possible sanctions, and as long as the contemnor is provided notice of the possible sanctions before admitting or denying the contempt allegation, due process, insofar as notice of the possible sanctions, is satisfied. Muthersbaugh v. Neumann, 133 Idaho 677, 991 P.2d 865 (Ct. App. 1999).

        In contempt proceedings for illegal practice of law, a demurrer would not lie to a single paragraph of the petition on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute practicing law, since the petition was sufficient if taken as a whole, and if it stated facts as a whole to constitute a charge of contempt, that is all that is required.

        A district judge who was also serving as an administrative district judge was cloaked in absolute judicial immunity from liability when he jailed a clerk and deputy clerk of court pursuant to a contempt order even though the judge was not in chambers nor were the parties involved in an adversary proceeding; jurisdiction is construed broadly where the issue is the immunity of a judge.

        Contempt proceedings will not lie against party for wrongfully diverting water to his own use where its use has been decreed to others, when his conduct does not otherwise violate any judgment, order, or process of court. Albrethson v. Ensign, 32 Idaho 687, 186 P. 911 (1920).

        Contempt is not proper proceeding to determine issue when person not party to judgment sets up bona fide claim to title of property involved in such judgment. Greene v. Edgington, 37 Idaho 1, 214 P. 751 (1923).

        A contempt proceeding under this section is a special proceeding criminal in nature, since a violation thereof is punishable by fine or imprisonment. Bandelin v. Quinlan, 94 Idaho 858, 499 P.2d 557 (1972).

        In a case where the mother granted her consent to her 17-year-old child’s marriage, but the father did not, the district court erred in affirming the magistrate’s judgment holding the mother in contempt for violating the order modifying custody, because the order did not clearly and unequivocally prohibit the mother from consenting to the child’s marriage.

        Due Process.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because of the criminal nature of a contempt proceeding, a person charged with contempt under this section is entitled to certain procedural due process protections before the court can impose sanctions: he is entitled to notice of the exact charges against him, proof that he had knowledge of the terms of the court’s order that he was alleged to have violated, notice of the sanctions which might be imposed against him (fine or jail term), and a trial or hearing on the charges raised. Ross v. Coleman Co., 114 Idaho 817, 761 P.2d 1169 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order to show cause is not fatally defective if it does not contain notice of possible sanctions, and as long as the contemnor is provided notice of the possible sanctions before admitting or denying the contempt allegation, due process, insofar as notice of the possible sanctions, is satisfied. Muthersbaugh v. Neumann, 133 Idaho 677, 991 P.2d 865 (Ct. App. 1999).

        In contempt proceedings for illegal practice of law, a demurrer would not lie to a single paragraph of the petition on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute practicing law, since the petition was sufficient if taken as a whole, and if it stated facts as a whole to constitute a charge of contempt, that is all that is required.

        The circuit court of appeals which had granted a decree enforcing back pay against an employer, on petition of the board, granted injunction restraining estranged wives and creditors of the employees entitled to the back pay from maintaining actions in the state courts for the purpose of carrying into effect attachment writs, and injunctive orders against the employer for the purpose of reaching back pay, since the power to punish contempt was not an adequate remedy.

       <p>
        Since contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, even though designed to impose punishment for violation of an order made in a civil action, no intendments or presumptions may be indulged to aid the sufficiency of the affidavit charging the contempt. First Sec. Bank v. Hansen, 107 Idaho 472, 690 P.2d 927 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff’s affidavit, wherein she alleged that a lawful court order existed requiring that defendant pay child support, that defendant had knowledge of that order, and that defendant had failed to comply with that order, was sufficient to vest the magistrate with jurisdiction over the contempt action.

        A violation of an order which is void because of lack of jurisdiction to make it is not a contempt of court and no one is under compulsion to obey it. State v. McNichols, 62 Idaho 616, 115 P.2d 104 (1941).

        The testimony clearly showed a course of wilful and persistent violation on the part of both defendants of the district court’s restraining order to cease interfering with plaintiff landowners’ use of water and by virtue thereof, factually, the district court was justified in adjudging defendants and each of them in contempt of its order.

    Definition of “willful” as an indifferent disregard of duty or a remissness and failure in performance of a duty but not a deliberately and maliciously planned dereliction of duty applies to contempt proceedings. Watson v. Weick (In re Weick), 142 Idaho 275, 127 P.3d 178 (2005).

        When an attorney is called as a witness and declines to answer questions or to produce letters or documents on the ground of privilege, the burden is upon him to establish the general privileged character of the communications or documents. In re Niday, 15 Idaho 559, 98 P. 845 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        A recalcitrant witness may be cited for contempt; continued refusal to answer questions within an area results in but a single contempt of a continuing nature and, to counter such contempt, civil as well as criminal contempt sanctions may be imposed although the imposition of multiple criminal sanctions is impermissible.

       <p>
        A contemnor’s prior history can be considered in determining the appropriate sanction; therefore, there was no error in considering the prior history of the attorney’s difficulty in being in court at the appointed time. State v. Delezene, 120 Idaho 473, 817 P.2d 139 (1991).

        To justify a coercive sanction, a person held in civil contempt must be able to comply with the court order in question; even if a defendant is unable to attack an enforcement order on the ground that he was unable to comply when the order was issued, he still may assert a present inability to comply as a defense to the contempt, but the burden of proving plainly and unmistakably that compliance is impossible rests with the contemnor.

        Failure to Appear.

        An attorney’s failure to appear is a direct contempt and, as such, no affidavits were required for the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the absent counsel. State v. Epperson, 130 Idaho 905, 950 P.2d 1244 (1997).

       <p>
        An attorney’s failure to be present in court when scheduled without valid excuse constitutes a hybrid form of direct contempt because the circumstances surrounding the absence were readily apparent to the court, but notice of the charges and a hearing were necessary; therefore, the court must issue an order to show cause and conduct a hearing to allow the attorney to explain the absence, and proof of knowledge by the attorney of the original court order must also be shown.

        The incarceration of the contemnor is not a voluntary or bad faith change in circumstance in the sense that the contemnor’s act is self-disabling; therefore, a change of economic circumstances due to incarceration may form a valid basis for inability to comply with a contempt order.

       </p>
       <p>
        Both this section and the Idaho criminal rules of court allow, if not require, that the judge who witnessed the conduct punish such conduct; therefore, because the judge is to preside at the hearing and the judge cannot be called as a witness, there is no right to call the judge as a witness in summary contempt proceedings.

        Because once an attorney has been given the opportunity to explain the absence to the court, all elements of direct contempt are present and the attorney’s absence is a direct contempt and because the attorney was notified of the contempt charge and the order, the district court did not err in treating the attorney’s failure to be present as a direct contempt.

        Both this section and the Idaho criminal rules of court allow, if not require, that the judge who witnessed the conduct punish such conduct; therefore, because the judge is to preside at the hearing and the judge cannot be called as a witness, there is no right to call the judge as a witness in summary contempt proceedings.

        Because when the contempt is an indirect contempt, an affidavit must be presented to the court and in this case it was not included in the record, reviewing court had to conclude the contempt order was properly served. State v. Schorzman, 129 Idaho 313, 924 P.2d 214 (1996). — Summary Contempt Proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the necessities of the summary contempt proceeding require that the judge who witnessed the conduct preside at the hearing and Idaho rules of evidence bar a judge from serving as both judge and witness in the same proceeding, there is no right to call a judge as a witness in summary contempt proceedings.

        Recusal by Judge.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A judge is not automatically prejudiced because it is the judge that is bringing the motion to show cause in a contempt proceeding; therefore, requiring recusal by a judge because it is the judge that institutes the contempt proceedings would not serve the interests of justice. State v. Delezene, 120 Idaho 473, 817 P.2d 139 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contempt proceedings are unique, criminal rules are used for guidance only, and they are not mandatory; therefore, in a proceeding for direct contempt, there is no right to disqualify the involved judge where the conduct of the attorney was not a personal affront to the magistrate.

        Sanctions.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The exercise of the broad power to impose civil sanctions is not without limitation; the sanctions imposed will be subject to appellate review under an abuse of discretion standard. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where reporter was adamant regarding her refusal to answer the questions first propounded in habeas corpus proceeding, which resulted in but a single contempt of a continuing nature, and magistrate first imposed a civil sanction by ordering reporter incarcerated until she purged herself of the contempt, there was no error in this ruling. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate’s subsequent modification of contempt order, which originally imposed incarceration, to impose a daily $500.00 fine for each day that reporter continued to refuse to answer the questions put to her in a habeas corpus proceeding was to coerce her testimony; this modification did not result in multiple criminal sanctions, but rather constituted a continuing coercive force terminable by compliance of the contemnor — the answering of the questions. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where reporter refused to answer questions in habeas corpus proceeding seeking to return child to father’s custody, the compelling state interests — the sanctity of the writ of habeas corpus and the safety of the child — outweighed any public interest in an unfettered press and magistrate did not abuse discretion in imposing contempt sanctions of incarceration and fines on reporter. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).

        Wilfulness.

       <p>
        Where in an action to modify child support the father was intermittently employed prior to his incarceration, had paid some of his attorney fees and had acquired a new motor vehicle, the record was sufficiently clear to preclude the necessity of additional findings by the trial court regarding his ability to pay support, and there was no error in the court’s conclusion that he was in contempt of court for diverting funds to his criminal defense instead of paying child support. Nab v. Nab, 114 Idaho 512, 757 P.2d 1231 (Ct. App. 1988). Wilfulness.
       </p>
       <p>
        An indifferent disregard of a duty—not deliberately and with malice—is a proper standard for determining wilfulness when an attorney fails to appear in court, and the burden of producing exculpatory evidence rests on the attorney. State v. Epperson, 130 Idaho 905, 950 P.2d 1244 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where attorney failed to appear at the continued arraignment because he neglected to calendar the hearing, this failure amounted to an indifferent disregard of a duty to the court and was contemptuous. State v. Epperson, 130 Idaho 905, 950 P.2d 1244 (1997).

        On appeal, a finding of contempt of court against defense counsel was vacated because a legitimate misunderstanding between the district court and counsel as to what was expected did not justify summarily imposing criminal contempt upon counsel, especially when the court’s order was subject to different interpretations and counsel’s interpretation was reasonable. Because counsel complied with one option outlined in the district court’s order, she should not have been held in contempt of court for failing to comply with the order. State v. Rice (In re Elliott), 145 Idaho 554, 181 P.3d 480 (2008).

        Where plaintiffs were awarded damages for crop damage due to defendants’ depriving them of their decreed irrigation waters both prior to and after the issuance of a court order restraining defendants, such award did not grow out of or depend upon defendants’ violation of the restraining order, and the court did not exceed its jurisdiction in fining defendants for contempt of the restraining order, since the amount assessed was assessed as a fine and not as plaintiffs’ damages, and no part of the fine was adjudged to be paid to the plaintiffs or either of them.

        Although a father was held in contempt for failure to pay child support, a trial court’s affirmance of a magistrate court order that denied him the ability to seek modification of child custody and support was error, because denial of access to the courts was not a possible criminal contempt sanction.

        Magistrate court’s reference to the statute of limitations for criminal contempt did not constitute an abuse of discretion regarding its decision to award a wife attorney fees in a husband’s contempt proceeding; absent legislative action, a criminal contempt sanction cannot be imposed for contempt unless the contempt proceedings are initiated within one year of the commission of the contempt.

       <p>
        Where reporter was adamant regarding her refusal to answer the questions first propounded in habeas corpus proceeding, which resulted in but a single contempt of a continuing nature, and magistrate first imposed a civil sanction by ordering reporter incarcerated until she purged herself of the contempt, there was no error in this ruling. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate’s subsequent modification of contempt order, which originally imposed incarceration, to impose a daily $500.00 fine for each day that reporter continued to refuse to answer the questions put to her in a habeas corpus proceeding was to coerce her testimony; this modification did not result in multiple criminal sanctions, but rather constituted a continuing coercive force terminable by compliance of the contemnor — the answering of the questions. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where reporter refused to answer questions in habeas corpus proceeding seeking to return child to father’s custody, the compelling state interests — the sanctity of the writ of habeas corpus and the safety of the child — outweighed any public interest in an unfettered press and magistrate did not abuse discretion in imposing contempt sanctions of incarceration and fines on reporter. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute over an access easement, the district court did not abuse its discretion by entering an injunction against appellant for contempt because the district court simply ordered the parties to continue abiding by the terms of the stipulated judgment — terms to which they were already bound. That action clearly fell within the judge’s authority to compel obedience. Steiner v. Gilbert, 144 Idaho 240, 159 P.3d 877 (2007).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an officer is required to keep a person arrested on a warrant of attachment in custody, and to bring him before a court or judge, the inability, from illness or otherwise, of the person to attend, is a sufficient excuse for not bringing him up; and the officer must not confine a person arrested upon the warrant in a prison, or otherwise restrain him of personal liberty, except so far as may be necessary to secure his personal attendance.

Jones v. Jones, 91 Idaho 578, 428 P.2d 497 (1967); Parker v. Parker, 97 Idaho 209, 541 P.2d 1177 (1975), superseded on other grounds, Stephens v. Stephens, 138 Idaho 195, 61 P.3d 63 (Ct. App. 2002).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where an owner of land is denied access for irrigation water across the lands of an adjacent landowner, the owner may condemn a right-of-way to supply the water under the law of eminent domain. White v. Marty, 97 Idaho 85, 540 P.2d 270 (1975), overruled on other grounds, Carr v. Magistrate Court, 108 Idaho 546, 700 P.2d 949 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The irrigation and reclamation of arid lands is a well recognized public use, even if the irrigation project is ostensibly intended to benefit only private individuals, and the right to condemn for individual use is supported on the theory that the development of individual property tends to the complete development of the entire state. Canyon View Irrigation Co. v. Twin Falls Canal Co., 101 Idaho 604, 619 P.2d 122 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 1983, 68 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an irrigation company had purchased approximately 300 cfs of Snake River water and sought to put that water to beneficial use on land located west of an existing canal system, but where the irrigation company had no canal and there existed no natural waterway by which its water could be transported by gravity to its stockholders’ lands, the irrigation company could condemn the right to enlarge and use the existing canal in common with the canal company and thus the irrigation company could divert its water from the Snake River into the canal company’s canal system and then reclaim a like amount, with due allowance for seepage and evaporation, at a headgate closer to its irrigation project site. Canyon View Irrigation Co. v. Twin Falls Canal Co., 101 Idaho 604, 619 P.2d 122 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 1983, 68 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1981).

        On appeal from final order of condemnation, court will review the original judgment of condemnation which was invalid and was never entered because of the correction of an error in it as made by respondent. State v. Styner, 58 Idaho 233, 72 P.2d 699 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state was responsible for an incorrect method of correcting a clerical error in a judgment of condemnation of property, the state could not take advantage of mistake so as to preclude property owners from obtaining a review of the judgment.

        In an action to enjoin trespasses on the plaintiff’s land by a reservoir company, which asserted ownership of a water right and right-of-way and easement for a reservoir and ditches on the land, where there was substantial evidence to support the trial court’s finding and judgment for the plaintiff, the supreme court was required to affirm the judgment.

       <p>
        Where landowners specifically alleged that the condemnors had alternative means of access and produced evidence of such alternative means of access, including one road then in use by the condemnors pursuant to a license agreement, it was incumbent upon the condemnors to prove that the alternative means of access were not available to them or that such means of access were not reasonably adequate or sufficient for their purposes.

        A complaint which referred to plaintiff’s land as a farm and alleged the necessity for a roadway from the public highway to that farm was sufficient under subdivision 5 of this section against a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted, it not being for the court to decide whether or not plaintiff could prove his property was a farm.

        Whether existing roads constitute a reasonably convenient way to a residence or farm is a question of fact to be determined by the evidence in an action to condemn a roadway across respondent’s land under subsection 5 of this section. McKenney v. Anselmo, 88 Idaho 197, 398 P.2d 226 (1965).

        If, by its enactment of subdivision 7 of this section, it was the intention of the legislature to restrict the exercise of eminent domain by a sewer district to uses within incorporated cities, then that provision can have no valid effect because the legislature cannot thus annul a provision of the constitution, such as<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art.

Postal Tel. Cable Co. v. Oregon Short Line R.R., 104 F. 623 (C.C.D. Idaho 1900), aff’d, 111 F. 842 (9th Cir. 1901).

        In suit in equity to compel the joint use of right of way already condemned by another, and to obtain the benefits thereof, on theory that condemnation was made for public use, and that appellants are members of public for whom such condemnation has been adjudged, there being no allegation showing necessity for such common use, and nothing to show that appellants cannot proceed and condemn right of way, the relief prayed for will be denied. Headrick v. Larson, 152 F. 93 (9th Cir. 1907).

        Rights of way may be condemned for the purposes of concurrent use in common with the existing owners; in such cases, the original easement owner is not really being deprived of his easement outright, only of its exclusive use, and the condemnation imposes a form of concurrent ownership where both the condemnor and condemnee will enjoy the right to use the easement.

       <p>
        Necessity is not measured by extent to which use is applied. Property devoted to or held for public use is subject to power of eminent domain if right is given by constitutional provision or legislative enactment; but it cannot be taken to be used in same manner and for same purpose to which it is already applied or held if by so doing that purpose will be defeated.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under this statute, the condemner must first establish that the taking is necessary to the intended use and since this gives the property owner the right to litigate that issue, he should not be penalized for so doing. Independent Sch. Dist. v. C.B. Lauch Constr. Co., 78 Idaho 485, 305 P.2d 1077 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the plaintiffs’ existing access was by way of a license, rather than an easement across the land of other adjoining property owners, does not destroy either the evidence or the finding of the court that alternative access routes existed nor the trial court’s holding based thereon that necessity for condemnation did not exist. Erickson v. Amoth, 99 Idaho 907, 591 P.2d 1074 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where landowners specifically alleged that the condemnors had alternative means of access and produced evidence of such alternative means of access, including one road then in use by the condemnors pursuant to a license agreement, it was then incumbent upon the condemnors to prove that the alternative means of access were not available to them or that such means of access were not reasonably adequate or sufficient for their purposes.

        This section, by implication, authorizes a second condemnation, and under it a telegraph company may condemn right of way for its line over right of way of railroad, where court finds that it is necessary and that it will not interfere with use of the property for the purpose of railroad, and that the second use is more necessary than the first.

       </p>
       <p>
        Property already devoted to a public use cannot be taken by eminent domain unless the condemnor proposes to put the property to a more necessary public use, however, the condemnor need not demonstrate a more necessary public use when condemning only the right to the common use of an existing right of way previously appropriated for public use. Canyon View Irrigation Co. v. Twin Falls Canal Co., 101 Idaho 604, 619 P.2d 122 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 1983, 68 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1981).

        Where the former owner’s use is defeated or seriously impaired, the condemnation amounts to an outright taking rather than an appropriation of concurrent ownership, thereby triggering the greater necessity requirement.

     <p>
      In all cases where land is required for public use the state or its agents in charge of such use may survey and locate the same, but it must be located in the manner which will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury, and subject to the provisions of this chapter. The state or its agents in charge of such public use, may enter upon the land and make examinations, surveys and maps thereof, and such entry shall constitute no cause for action in favor of the owners of the land, except for injuries resulting from negligence, wantonness or malice.

        In a proceeding to condemn property for a highway, evidence of the price paid for the property when purchased from an estate was inadmissible since such sale was in the nature of a forced sale and not pertinent in proving the market value; nor was evidence of the amount of assessed value for tax purposes admissible since the amount did not prove the market value.

        There was no reason that the relocation expenses should not be included as part of the business damages, because they were reasonably caused by the taking, when the relocation costs awarded by the jury included the cost of moving the business operations to other portions of the property and the expense of widening the city’s roadway to include additional lanes so that trucks could access the property safely, which became necessary because of the 11-foot drop between the city’s new roadway and the surrounding property.

        In an inverse condemnation action based on the state’s decision to acquire a portion of defendant’s property for a highway improvement project, the district court correctly dismissed defendant’s inverse condemnation claim and request for business damages. Defendant’s claims based on restricted traffic flow and the reduced visibility of its hotel were not compensable takings under Idaho law, as it was undisputed that motorists still had free access to and from defendant’s property. State v. HI Boise, LLC, 153 Idaho 334, 282 P.3d 595 (2012).

       <p>
        Although damages assessed in a condemnation action include the value of the improvements pertaining to the realty, supreme court could not determine whether alleged fixtures removed by condemnee were considered by the jury in arriving at its award in the absence of findings by the trial court or a proper jury instruction, and condemnor was not entitled to the alleged fixtures. State ex rel. Flandro v. Seddon, 94 Idaho 940, 500 P.2d 841 (1972).

       <p>
        The state is required to pay just compensation for the value of land taken through eminent domain and for any damages caused to other property by the severance; however, the compensation is not affected by land which is taken or damaged due to the exercise of police powers or land which may be divided among persons with various interests including leaseholds. State ex rel. Moore v. Bastian, 97 Idaho 444, 546 P.2d 399 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporation’s counsel indicated only a small fraction of the total damages awarded by the jury were for value of the actual property taken, even though a substantial amount of the damages were due to severance of the corporation’s property; although severance damages could be estimated before a taking occurred, they could be more accurately and satisfactorily determined after completion of construction. C & G, Inc. v. Canyon Highway Dist. No. 4, 139 Idaho 140, 75 P.3d 194 (2003).
    The state in a condemnation proceeding for taking of land of manufacturing concern used as storage by the defendant was not entitled to contend that there was available to the defendant for storage other state owned land, since the defendant was entitled to cash for the damage sustained by it and was not required to take other land in exchange. State ex rel. Rich v. Dunclick, Inc., 77 Idaho 45, 286 P.2d 1112 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of eminent domain extends to every kind of property taken for public use, including the right of access to public streets, such being an estate or interest in and appurtenant to real property; and since such right of access constitutes an interest in, by virtue of being an easement appurtenant to, a larger parcel, the court must ascertain and assess the damages which will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned by reason of the severance of the portion — the right of access — sought to be condemned and the construction of the improvement. Hughes v. State, 80 Idaho 286, 328 P.2d 397 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an eminent domain proceeding, it is the mandatory duty of the court, jury or referee to assess the value of the property sought to be condemned, and if such property constitutes a part of a larger parcel, the damages which will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned, by reason of the severance, and the construction of any improvement in the manner proposed by the condemnor, likewise must be ascertained and assessed. Big Lost River Irrigation Dist. v. Zollinger, 83 Idaho 401, 363 P.2d 706 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an eminent domain proceeding where expert witnesses were of the opinion that the land taken by the improvement would cause a reduction by the amount of land taken in the animal units of feed produced thus reducing the animal carrying capacity of the ranch, such reduction, resulting in a loss of at least $7,000 annually, was a damage that must be ascertained and assessed. Big Lost River Irrigation Dist. v. Zollinger, 83 Idaho 401, 363 P.2d 706 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the court’s findings specifically set out each item of property taken and the value thereof, but do not delineate whether the various items of damage constituted valuations for property taken or severance damages, any error in the form of such damages was rendered harmless by the court’s conclusion of law to the effect that the owners were entitled to judgment for $5,222.

    Paragraph (2)(a) provides that, following the taking of a parcel of land through eminent domain, just compensation includes any decrease in the value of remaining property based on the future existence of any planned improvements to the taken property and the planned uses of those improvements. Just compensation does not include any physical damages that accrue to the remaining property during the construction of any improvements on the taken property.

If the condemning authority does not supply the owner of the real property with this form, there will be a presumption that any sale or contract entered into between the condemning authority and the owner was not voluntary and the condemning authority may be held responsible for such relief, if any, as the court may determine to be appropriate considering all of the facts and circumstances.

      For the purpose of assessing compensation and damages, the right thereto shall be deemed to have accrued at the date of the summons, and its actual value, at that date, shall be the measure of compensation for all property to be actually taken, and the basis of damages to property not actually taken, but injuriously affected, in all cases where such damages are allowed, as provided in the last section. No improvements put upon the property subsequent to the date of the service of summons shall be included in the assessment of compensation or damages.

        Under this section requiring determination of damages for the area taken in the eminent domain proceeding as of June 27, 1958, deduction for existing flood damage for which recovery was sought in this action would have to be made in determining the valuation of the premises sought to be taken.

        Primarily right of trial by jury is accorded equally to both parties to action; as a substitute therefor there is accorded to plaintiff the right of having commissioners appointed to assess the damages that will be sustained by defendant, and if plaintiff pays such award and defendant accepts same, right of trial by jury is ended; if, on the other hand, plaintiff pays the award and defendant refuses to accept it, plaintiff may no longer demand a jury, but defendant may still demand a jury to assess the damages that he will sustain.

        An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees to the condemnee in an eminent domain proceeding is a matter for the trial court’s guided discretion and, as in other areas of the law, such award will be overturned only upon a showing of abuse; the condemnee’s costs may be awarded under Idaho R.

       </p>
       <p>
        In determining award of attorneys’ fees to a condemnee, the court should consider the following factors: whether the condemnor reasonably made a timely offer of settlement of at least 90 percent of the ultimate jury verdict and whether such offer was made within a reasonable period after the institution of the action; any controverting of the public use and necessity allegations; the outcome of any hearing thereon and any modification in the plans or design of the condemnor’s project resulting from the condemnee’s challenge; and whether the condemnee voluntarily granted possession of the property pending resolution of the just compensation issue. As to the amount of attorneys’ fees awardable, the criteria outlined in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3) are appropriate in condemnation, as in all other civil cases; however, the court should not automatically adopt any contingent fee or contractual arrangement, but rather the fee awarded may be more or less than that provided in the lawyer-client contract.

        The Idaho transportation board negotiated in good faith for property condemned to facilitate the widening of a highway and the creation of an interchange. The valuation by the board was fair and did not have to take into account a possible increase in value due to a proposed extension of an unrelated road.

    Arbitration agreement in insured’s short-term health insurance policy was not unenforceable as unconscionable because there was no showing that the insured had limited ability to investigate other health insurance contracts in order to avoid those with arbitration clauses; the insured had purchased a similar contract in the past and, therefore, could not claim lack of notice of the policy’s arbitration provision; the cost of arbitrating was not unreasonable given the insured’s potential recovery because by right she could have recovered much of her costs if she prevailed in arbitration. Lovey v. Regence Blueshield of Idaho, 139 Idaho 37, 72 P.3d 877 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        An agreement to arbitrate was unenforceable where large arbitration costs precluded the insured from effectively vindicating his federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum; the arbitration provision, which required each party to bear the cost of the arbitrator, plus the costs of witnesses and attorney fees, was unconscionable based upon the relatively small amount claimed under the policy by the insured.

Moore v. Omnicare, Inc., 141 Idaho 809, 118 P.3d 141 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Arbitration panel did not have authority to award attorney fees pursuant to American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules incorporated into an asset purchase agreement and Idaho statutory law because the agreement clearly stated that AAA rules governed procedural rather than substantive issues. Idaho law, which included the Idaho Uniform Arbitration Act,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c09s7-901" target="_blank">§ 7-901 </a></cite>et seq., applied to interpretation of the parties’ contract terms under the agreement and the parties contracted for a zero dollar amount or claim with respect to an award of attorney’s fees.

    Attorney fees were not awarded where the party did little more than ask the appellate court to re-evaluate the well-reasoned opinion of the district court, arguing that the Idaho Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA),<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c09s7-901" target="_blank">§ 7-901 </a></cite>et seq., did not apply to his employment agreement. That argument ignored the language of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c09s7-901" target="_blank">§ 7-901 </a></cite>that the UAA applied to employment contracts where the parties had so agreed and the parties had not so agreed in the case at bar. Moore v. Omnicare, Inc., 141 Idaho 809, 118 P.3d 141 (2005). Claims Against Counties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature, in passing the Uniform Arbitration Act, did not exempt governmental entities from its operation; thus, it appears that in Idaho there exists no statutory prohibition against a county’s submission of a claim to arbitration but, rather, a strong public policy favors arbitration of disputes. Bingham County Comm’n v. Interstate Elec. Co., 105 Idaho 36, 665 P.2d 1046 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The arbitration power of a county does not conflict with the right of a taxpayer to appeal claims paid by a county, because a taxpayer has that right only if a claim is allowed. Bingham County Comm’n v. Interstate Elec. Co., 105 Idaho 36, 665 P.2d 1046 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        A board of commissioners is forbidden to pay a claim asserted against it until certain procedures are followed; these procedures merely require a claim to be submitted to the commission before an aggrieved party can take further action and there is no reason why an aggrieved party cannot then submit his claim to arbitration rather than commencing a district court action. Bingham County Comm’n v. Interstate Elec. Co., 105 Idaho 36, 665 P.2d 1046 (1983).

        Application of the Uniform Arbitration Act did not violate plaintiff’s right of access to the courts by precluding a meaningful review of the arbitrators’ decision, as the plaintiff challenged the validity of the clause in her insurance contract that permitted the insurer to require binding arbitration by opposing its motion in district court to compel arbitration, but failed to preserve this option.

        The question of arbitrability is a question of law properly for determination by the court. A court reviewing an arbitration clause will order arbitration unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.

        Where an examination of the record of the district court’s hearing, at which the court found that a valid arbitration agreement existed, did not show that the court unduly restricted the appellant’s right to present contrary evidence, nor that the court’s finding of a valid agreement to arbitrate was clearly erroneous, the supreme court would not disturb the district court’s finding.

        This section on its face militates against the power of an arbitrator to award attorney fees to one of the parties absent a contractual agreement to do so; accordingly, where no such agreement existed in the contract of the parties, it was beyond the power of the arbitrator to award such fees. Bingham County Comm’n v. Interstate Elec. Co., 105 Idaho 36, 665 P.2d 1046 (1983).
    Absent agreement to the contrary, an arbitrator has authority and jurisdiction to award prejudgment interest. Schilling v. Allstate Ins. Co., 132 Idaho 927, 980 P.2d 1014 (1999), overruled on other grounds, Greenough v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 142 Idaho 589, 130 P.3d 1127 (2006) and Cranney v. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co., 145 Idaho 6, 175 P.3d 168 (2007).

       <p>
        Arbitrator had authority under this section to award prejudgment interest since, in his first award, the arbitrator recognized that he had the authority and jurisdiction to award prejudgment interest and he recognized the insurer’s argument that the compensatory damages award may be subject to subrogation for workers’ compensation benefits, and the arbitrator properly calculated the maximum allowed by the contract without taking into consideration the workers’ compensation claim or rights to subrogation. Am. Foreign Ins. Co. v. Reichert, 140 Idaho 394, 94 P.3d 699 (2004).

        If a party wishes to take the precaution of preparing a record, it is not unreasonable to require the party to temporarily bear the cost. As in the judicial system, these costs may ultimately be awarded to the prevailing party; thus, the initial imposition of this cost upon one party is not sufficient to constitute a denial of due process.

        Once a judgment is entered by the court after an arbitration proceeding, that judgment is entitled to be treated in all respects as any other judgment; therefore, where adjudicatory procedures were present in the arbitration proceeding, the parties were given notice, they were able to formulate the issues of law and fact in their memos to the arbitrator, they had the right to present evidence and legal arguments, and most importantly, the arbitration matter was deemed to be a final resolution between the parties, and where the record indicated the nature of the claims made by the parties, as well as the findings and conclusions, the judgment entered reflected the ultimate award entered by the arbitrator after the respective awards to parties were offset, and there had been a final judgment entered from which the courts could determine the applicability of the bar of collateral estoppel.

        Application of the Uniform Arbitration Act,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c09s7-901" target="_blank">§ 7-901 </a></cite>et seq., did not violate the plaintiff’s right of access to the courts by precluding a meaningful review of the arbitrator’s decision, as the plaintiff challenged the validity of the clause in her insurance contract that permitted the insurer to require binding arbitration by opposing its motion in district court to compel arbitration, but failed to preserve this option. Cady v. Allstate Ins. Co., 113 Idaho 667, 747 P.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1987).

        Arbitrator Exceeding Powers.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Normally, courts construe the phrase “exceeded his [their] powers” in subdivision (a)(3) of this section to mean that the arbitrator considered an issue not submitted to him by the parties, or exceeded the bounds of the contract between the parties. Bingham County Comm’n v. Interstate Elec. Co., 105 Idaho 36, 665 P.2d 1046 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the arbitrator, in a dispute between a county and an electrical contractor, made an award within the submission of the dispute of the parties, under a reasonable construction of the parties’ contract, he did not exceed his powers; thus, the award of the arbitrator must be confirmed. Bingham County Comm’n v. Interstate Elec. Co., 105 Idaho 36, 665 P.2d 1046 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the arbitrator considered an issue that was clearly submitted to him and did not exceed any limitations contained in the parties’ agreement, he did not exceed his powers in concluding that the element of causation was missing and entering an award granting judgment to attorney in a professional malpractice claim. Chicoine v. Bignall, 127 Idaho 225, 899 P.2d 438 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Arbitrator’s first award, in which he simply awarded the maximum prejudgment interest amount, was reinstated since by modifying his award, the arbitrator took into consideration that the insurer may be entitled to subrogation rights from the workers’ compensation claim and, thus, exceeded the bounds of the contract between the parties. Am. Foreign Ins. Co. v. Reichert, 140 Idaho 394, 94 P.3d 699 (2004).

        Attorney’s fees.

       <p>
        The mere fact that an arbitrator’s interpretation of a prior case is unsatisfactory to a party is not, of itself, a valid basis for appeal; thus, where the nonprevailing party presented no cogent argument as to why settled law did not apply, the appeal was pursued frivolously and without foundation and attorney, prevailing in professional malpractice case, was entitled to attorney fees. Chicoine v. Bignall, 127 Idaho 225, 899 P.2d 438 (1995).
    District court properly vacated arbitration panel’s award of attorney fees on an earnings holdback claim in an asset purchase agreement because the agreement required that the parties were to bear their own costs and fees of arbitration, including specifically attorney fees. The panel’s award of attorney fees on the holdback claim contravened that express language and was, therefore, beyond the scope of the arbitrators’ authority. Moore v. Omnicare, Inc., 141 Idaho 809, 118 P.3d 141 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of the claimant’s request for an award of attorney fees was affirmed because, where the parties clearly submitted the issue of attorney fees for decision and the arbitrator determined the issue, the arbitrator did not exceed his powers; the appellate court would not review the propriety of the arbitrator’s factual determinations or the correctness of his determinations regarding applicable Idaho law. Mumford v. Miller, 143 Idaho 99, 137 P.3d 1021 (2006).

        Lack of a record and the arbitrators’ failure to prepare written findings of fact and conclusions of law in arbitration under insurance contract did not deny plaintiff due process. Cady v. Allstate Ins. Co., 113 Idaho 667, 747 P.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1987).

        <p class="">
    In some instances the subsection, subdivision, etc. designations in the Idaho version of a section of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act are different than those of the official version. For instance,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c10s7-1011" target="_blank">§ 7-1011</a></cite>, Idaho Code contains subsections (1) to (8) with subsection (2) containing subdivisions (a) to (c) and subdivision (b) containing clauses (i) and (ii). The official version of this provision, Section 207, contains subsections (a) to (h) with subsection (b) containing subdivisions (1) to (3) and subdivision (2) containing clauses (A) and (B). Therefore, a reference in the official comments to subsection (b)(2)(A) would be a reference to subsection (2)(b)(ii) in the Idaho version. In these instances, in the official comments, the compiler has added in brackets the references to the Idaho version of the section. Also the references in the official comments to “Act” should be translated as “Chapter” for the Idaho version and where the official comments refer to “Part” of a certain “Article” the corresponding reference to the Idaho version has been added in brackets. Effective Dates.

        Section 68 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    (29) “Tribunal” means a court, administrative agency, or quasi-judicial entity authorized to establish, enforce, or modify support orders or to determine parentage of a child.

It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.” •Title 7»«Ch. 10»«§ 7-1015»

       <p>
        The focus of Subsection (a) [(1)] is on providing services to a petitioner, and not merely on “representing” the obligee. Care should be exercised in the use of terminology given this substantial alteration of past practice under RURESA. Not only may either the obligee or the obligor request services, but that request may be in the context of the establishment of an initial child-support order, enforcement or review and adjustment of an existing child-support order, or a modification of that order (upward or downward). Note that the Act does not distinguish between child support and spousal support for purposes of providing services. Note also, that the services available may differ significantly; for example, modification of spousal support is limited to the issuing State, see Section 205(f) [§ 7-1015],

        Section 68 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    Section 69 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Report — Legislative Intent. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall monitor proceedings affecting Idaho residents that are conducted pursuant to the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance and make a report of such proceedings to the Legislature upon request. If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

        Section 68 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    Section 69 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Report — Legislative Intent. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall monitor proceedings affecting Idaho residents that are conducted pursuant to the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance and make a report of such proceedings to the Legislature upon request. If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care.

It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”

If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions.

Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”

        Section 68 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    Section 69 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Report — Legislative Intent. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall monitor proceedings affecting Idaho residents that are conducted pursuant to the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance and make a report of such proceedings to the Legislature upon request. If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions.

        Section 68 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    Section 69 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Report — Legislative Intent. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall monitor proceedings affecting Idaho residents that are conducted pursuant to the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance and make a report of such proceedings to the Legislature upon request. If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

        Section 68 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    Section 69 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Report — Legislative Intent. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall monitor proceedings affecting Idaho residents that are conducted pursuant to the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance and make a report of such proceedings to the Legislature upon request. If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

        Section 68 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act [§ 56-1003], develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    Section 69 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Report — Legislative Intent. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall monitor proceedings affecting Idaho residents that are conducted pursuant to the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance and make a report of such proceedings to the Legislature upon request. If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

       Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.

If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.

       <p>
        In a paternity suit where the child was only 15 months old, testimony of the mother concerning physical similarities between the putative father and the child was insufficient in itself to establish paternity; but since the matter was tried to the court, the admission into evidence of the child for purposes of comparison was not reversible error.

       <p>
        In a paternity suit where defendant failed to establish any relevance between evidence concerning plaintiff’s reputation for sexual availability and the issue of access during the time period when conception was possible, the court correctly excluded defendant’s evidence of plaintiff’s prior lack of chastity.

      Each parent of a child conceived or born out of wedlock is liable for the necessary support and education of the child and for the child’s funeral expenses. If a parent dies, an order of support or a judicially approved settlement made prior to that parent’s death shall be enforceable as a claim against the deceased parent’s estate in an amount to be determined by the probate court not greater than is provided in the order of settlement, having regard to the age of the child, the ability of the surviving parent to support and educate it, the amount of property left by the deceased parent, and the number, age and financial condition of those other persons legally entitled to support by the deceased parent during his or her lifetime.

      § 7-1106. Acknowledgment of paternity.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t07c11s7-1106ol11">
       A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity for an Idaho birth shall be admissible as evidence of paternity and shall constitute a legal finding of paternity upon the filing of a signed and notarized acknowledgment with the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare. If the mother was married at the time of either conception or birth, or between conception and birth, and the husband is not the father of the child, the husband may file an executed and notarized affidavit of nonpaternity if it is accompanied by a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity signed and notarized by the mother and the alleged father. Any party executing an acknowledgment of paternity or affidavit of nonpaternity may file a notarized rescission of such with the vital statistics unit within the earlier of:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t07c11s7-1106ol11a">
         Sixty (60) days after the acknowledgment is filed; or
        </li>
        <li id="t07c11s7-1106ol11b">
         The date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child, including a proceeding to establish a support order, in which the signatory is a party.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t07c11s7-1106ol12">
       After the period for rescission, an executed acknowledgment of paternity may be challenged only in court on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the party challenging the acknowledgment. The legal responsibilities, including the obligation to pay child support, of any party to the acknowledgment shall not be stayed except for good cause shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c11s7-1106ol13">
       The court may enter an order for the support of a child upon execution of a voluntary acknowledgment without further proceedings to establish paternity.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c11s7-1106ol14">
       The director shall prescribe forms for acknowledgment of paternity, affidavits of nonpaternity, and rescission thereof, and the board of health and welfare may promulgate such rules as are necessary to prescribe forms and establish fees to recover costs of maintaining such system.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Such rescission shall be effective upon filing with the vital statistics unit. The vital statistics unit shall notify the other party or parties of the rescission by certified mail.

        A party seeking to rescind a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity affidavit (VAP) is not required to show that one of the parties executing the VAP did so as a result of fraud, duress, or material mistake; rather, the party seeking rescission must show that his or her acknowledgement of paternity was the product of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.

        When a mother sought relief from a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity affidavit (VAP) over 60 days after the affidavit was signed, based on an alleged material mistake of fact, a reasonable person standard applied, because (1) a VAP is analogous to a judgment, as a VAP is a legal finding of paternity, and (2) a reasonable person standard ensures finality of the acknowledgment and provides stability for the child.

       The court may, and upon request of a party shall, require the child, mother, alleged father, or any male witness who testifies or will testify about his sexual relations with the mother at a possible time of conception to submit to genetic tests. The department of health and welfare may order or the individuals may voluntarily agree to such tests. The tests shall be performed by an expert qualified as an examiner of genetic markers. Verified documentation of the chain of custody of the genetic evidence is competent evidence to establish chain of custody. A verified expert’s report prepared by a laboratory approved by the American association of blood banks or other accreditation body shall be admitted at trial unless a challenge to the testing procedures or the genetic analysis has been made twenty-one (21) days before trial. The genetic test report must be served upon the defendant party with the complaint or as soon as it is obtained, and in any event at least twenty-eight (28) days before a trial together with a notice that the genetic test will be admitted unless a challenge to the testing procedures or the genetic analysis has been made by a party at least twenty-one (21) days before trial. A genetic test result with a probability of paternity of at least ninety-eight percent (98%) shall create a rebuttable presumption of paternity.
      </li>

       The court, upon reasonable request by a party, shall order that independent tests be performed by other experts qualified as examiners of genetic markers present on blood cells and components. Additional tests performed by other experts of the same qualifications may be ordered by the court at the expense of the party requesting additional testing.

      <li id="t07c11s7-1116ol15">
       Whenever the results of the tests exclude any male witness from possible paternity, the tests shall be conclusive evidence of nonpaternity of the male witness. The refusal of any party to submit to the genetic tests shall be disclosed to the court and is subject to the sanctions within the jurisdiction of the court. If the action was brought by the child’s mother, but she refuses to submit herself or the child to genetic tests, the action shall be dismissed.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c11s7-1116ol16">
       Any party calling a male witness for the purpose of testifying that he had sexual intercourse with the mother at any possible time of conception shall provide all other parties with the name and address of the witness twenty (20) days before the trial or pretrial hearing. If a male witness is produced at the hearing for the purpose stated in this subsection, but the party calling the witness failed to provide the twenty (20) day notice, the court may adjourn the proceeding for the purpose of taking a genetic test of the witness prior to hearing the testimony of the witness if the court finds that the party calling the witness acted in good faith.

        The presence of counsel to rebut the presumption of paternity arising from genetic tests would result in de minimis benefits, as the risk of erroneous determinations is already limited by highly accurate blood tests, and as the court may, upon reasonable request by a party, order independent tests.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Since this section does not require the blood test expert’s presence at the trial, the court’s appointment of an expert who resided beyond the court’s subpoena power was not prejudicial, where the defendant was present when the expert’s deposition was taken and extensively cross-examined him.

       <p>
        This section’s plain import is that any challenge to the admissibility of a blood test report should be raised 20 days before trial. The purpose of this requirement is to allow the plaintiff sufficient time to subpoena experts to testify on the blood analysis methodology, the chain of custody, or other issues affecting admissibility of the report. The verification itself could be such an issue. An asserted lack of verification may be a ground for objection, but it is not an excuse for making the objection tardily. State of Alaska ex rel. Sweat v. Hansen, 116 Idaho 927, 782 P.2d 50 (Ct. App. 1989).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that a significant number of people who are owed child support are not paid in accordance with the terms of their child support orders; that this causes a severe financial hardship upon custodial parents and constitutes a significant detriment to the rearing and support of minor children whom the orders intended to support. Further, P.L. 98-378 requires each state to implement statutorily prescribed procedures to improve the effectiveness of child support enforcement. Although the department of health and welfare does not have the authority to establish support orders administratively, the act as amended in 1988 enables the department to give full faith and credit to all legally enforceable support orders issued by other states. The collection remedies required by federal law are enacted in section 7-1203, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that the remedy of suspension of a wide variety of licenses is needed to increase the effectiveness of enforcement of child support orders, compliance with subpoenas in paternity and child support cases, and compliance with orders for visitation with minor children. The legislature intends that there be no exceptions to the licenses, as defined in this chapter, that are the subject of suspension, in order to promote the well-being of Idaho’s children.

      To reduce the cost and expense of litigation and encourage the swift, fair and cost-effective resolution of disputes, the legislature hereby establishes a system to encourage civil litigants to resolve their disputes through alternative dispute resolution. The procedures to be utilized under this chapter, while based on the alternative dispute resolution processes of arbitration, mediation, and early neutral evaluation, are intended to be as informal as practicable to accomplish these concurrent objectives.

For actions pending in the magistrates division, however, notice shall be filed at least one hundred (100) days prior to a scheduled trial but, without consent of all the parties, may not be filed within thirty (30) days following the service of a complaint.

The moving party has a right to a hearing pursuant to the Idaho rules of civil procedure. In making its determination on the motion, the court shall consider, among other factors it deems relevant, the nature of the claim(s) and the defense(s), the prior experience, if any, of the parties or their counsel with mediation or evaluation, in this or other cases, the potential likelihood that the facts alleged in a claim, if proven, will lead to liability of one party to another, and the complexity of the case. If the court does not determine that mediation is a preferable means of alternative dispute resolution for the particular case, it shall order the parties to conduct an evaluation under the provisions of this chapter.

       The supreme court shall maintain a list of private civil litigation evaluators who are approved to serve in each district pursuant to this chapter and any rules adopted by the supreme court. Each county’s clerk of the court shall from time to time be provided by the supreme court a list of evaluators who are approved to serve in that county pursuant to this chapter and any rules adopted by the supreme court.

If there are more than two (2) parties to the litigation, the clerk will provide ten (10) names.

       In every case each party may submit requests for replacement list(s) to the clerk within three (3) days of receipt of a list of evaluators. Upon receipt of such a request, the clerk of the court shall provide each party to the case a new list containing an appropriate number of names of randomly selected evaluators.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c15s7-1504ol15">
       Within seven (7) days of receipt of the list, it shall be the duty of the party that filed the notice initiating proceedings under this chapter to initiate contact with the other party or parties for the purpose of selecting an evaluator. Unless the parties agree on a particular evaluator or a different method of selection, selection of the evaluator will be by alternating strikes. The initiating party shall strike an evaluator’s name, the opposing party shall then strike an evaluator’s name with the parties alternating until only one (1) name is left. If there are more than two (2) parties, the strikes shall be made in the order the parties’ names appear on the case caption commencing with the initiating party.

       If there is any dispute or failure to cooperate with the selection procedures contained in this section, any party may file a motion with the court for assistance in selection of an evaluator. No hearing shall be required and the court shall rule on such motion expeditiously and take whatever steps are necessary to obtain the prompt selection of an evaluator. If the court finds that a party has requested a replacement list of evaluators unreasonably or determines it is otherwise appropriate, the court may appoint a sitting or retired judge or a private lawyer from the list of approved evaluators to serve as evaluator for the case.

    (8) Nothing shall preclude the parties stipulating to the appointment of any individual who agrees to serve as their evaluator under this statute. If the parties stipulate to the appointment of an evaluator different from one on the list provided by the clerk, they shall file a joint statement to that effect with the court.

      (9) To the extent it deems necessary, the supreme court may prescribe rules to reduce the costs of evaluation under this chapter. It may also prescribe forms to be used in the evaluation process, and other rules, standards or procedures it deems appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

     <p>
      (10) The supreme court may exempt all cases filed in the courts of any county from the operation of this chapter if, following application made by the administrative judge of the judicial district which includes that county, the supreme court determines the county does not have sufficient judicial or other resources to implement and effectuate the purposes of this chapter or for other good cause shown.

      </li>
      <li id="t07c15s7-1505ol12">
       To be listed as a private civil litigation evaluator, a person must currently be an active member of the Idaho state bar association and have had such membership for a minimum of seven (7) years or be a retired or senior judge. To the extent it deems them necessary, the supreme court may prescribe by rule additional qualifications for civil litigation evaluators in some or all cases with the purpose of providing the largest pool of individuals with the knowledge and experience to fairly determine claims under this chapter at minimal or no cost to litigants.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c15s7-1505ol13">
       Upon appointment in each case, the evaluator must sign an oath to fulfill the duties of the office, including the impartial, unbiased and timely discharge of those duties. He must also affirmatively state that he has no conflict of interest or, in the alternative, make a written disclosure of any conflict of interest to the parties, which they may waive by filing a written consent with the evaluator. Challenges to the service of an evaluator shall be made by motion to the trial court and shall be heard expeditiously. Evaluators may decline an appointment. The trial court may also release evaluators from an appointment for good cause. If an evaluator declines or is released from service, a new list shall be requested from the clerk for selection of an evaluator.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c15s7-1505ol14">
       Evaluators shall submit their rates of hourly compensation, if any, to the supreme court when submitting their request to be on the list of civil litigation evaluators. The clerk shall include the rate of hourly compensation, if any, for each evaluator in the list of names submitted to the parties. The parties shall each pay an equal portion of a private evaluator’s fee if any is charged as well as an equal portion of any actual costs incurred by the private evaluator. Individuals who wish to serve as private civil litigation evaluators under this chapter other than on a pro bono basis shall agree to serve as an evaluator in exchange for a fee not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) unless the parties agree otherwise. Provided however, sitting or senior judges appointed as evaluators by the supreme court or administrative judge as part of their judicial service shall not be compensated by the parties. Retired or senior judges selected by the parties from the roster of private civil litigation evaluators maintained by the supreme court through the administrative director of the courts shall be compensated by the parties in accordance with this subsection.

The evaluator shall file a notice of issuance of the evaluator’s decision with the clerk of the court, together with proof of service of the notice and the decision on the parties. The decision shall not be filed with the clerk of the court. The evaluator’s decision shall not exceed thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) in total damages to a party.

Any dollar amount sought, demanded or awarded during the evaluation, including the parties’ agreement that for the purposes of the evaluation the claim is limited to thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000), shall be treated as an offer of compromise pursuant to the Idaho rules of evidence and shall not be admissible at trial. Any examination made pursuant to the provisions of section 7-1507(1)(c), Idaho Code, shall be subject to rule 35 of the Idaho rules of civil procedure.
