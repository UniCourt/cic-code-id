    This is a comprehensive act passed under the police power which is valid as against the following objections: 1. That the legislature had no power to grant to the public utilities commission power to restrict competition; 2. That legislative authority is delegated to said commission in an unconstitutional manner; 3. That said commission is a judicial body established in contravention of<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. V, § 2.</cite> Idaho Power &amp; Light Co. v. Blomquist, 26 Idaho 222, 141 P. 1083 (1914). Legislature Can Impose Tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature has the right to impose a business tax for revenue and the mere fact that in some cases the act may work a hardship is not grounds for declaring it unconstitutional, unless it is so unreasonable as to be confiscatory and oppressive in its general operation upon the business.

    Where a railroad holds out to the public that it will operate as a common carrier, and exercises the right of eminent domain, it cannot contend that it is not a common carrier because it has never operated as such. Codd v. McGoldrick Lumber Co., 46 Idaho 256, 267 P. 439 (1928).

        The supreme court’s review of whether the evidence presented to the public utilities commission is competent and substantial must be tempered by a consideration of whether a proposed new rate structure is also just and reasonable as required by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t61c03s61-315" target="_self">§§ 61-315 </a></cite>and 61-502 and this section.

        The public utilities commission has authority to fix rates which are just and equitable, both to the people and to the corporation. Idaho Power & Light Co. v. Blomquist, 26 Idaho 222, 141 P. 1083 (1914).

        Criteria for Rate Differentiation.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the commission has power to regulate and fix charges and rates, but a utility is enjoined from establishing rates or charges which are preferential or discriminatory, it follows by implication that the commission’s authority may only be exercised in such a way as to fix nondiscriminatory, and nonpreferential rates and charges. Idaho State Homebuilders v. Washington Water Power, 107 Idaho 415, 690 P.2d 350 (1984). Criteria for Rate Differentiation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a legislative pronouncement to the contrary, it is within the public utilities commission’s jurisdictional province to consider in its rate making capacity all relevant criteria, including energy conservation and concomitant concepts of optimum use and resource allocation. Grindstone Butte Mut. Canal Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 102 Idaho 175, 627 P.2d 804 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        As between classes of service, whether those classes be as between schedules or as between customers within a schedule, valid considerations for rate differentiation are the quantity of the utility used, the nature of the use, the time of use, the pattern of use, the differences in the conditions of service, the costs of service, the reasonable efficiency and economy of operation, the actual differences in the situation of the consumers for the furnishing of the service, contribution to peak load, costs of service on peak demand days, costs of storage and economic incentives; one criterion is not necessarily more essential than another nor is the list of criteria exclusive.

        Reasonable Classifications.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A reasonable classification of utility customers may justify the setting of different rates and charges for the different classes of customers; any such difference in a utility’s rates and charges must be justified by a corresponding classification of customers that is based upon factors such as cost of service, quantity of electricity used, differences in conditions of service, or the time, nature and pattern of the use. Idaho State Homebuilders v. Washington Water Power, 107 Idaho 415, 690 P.2d 350 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order of the public utility commission imposing a nonrecurring charge of $50.00 per kilowatt on the installation of or conversion to electric space heating after a fixed date exceeded the commission’s authority to fix and regulate rates, since it discriminatorily differentiated between classes of new and old customers without reference to the pattern, nature, and time of usage, quantity, cost of service, or difference in condition of service as between the two classes. Idaho State Homebuilders v. Washington Water Power, 107 Idaho 415, 690 P.2d 350 (1984).
    Where cost of servicing all water customers increased due to several factors including passage of a federal act, court held no particular group of customers should bear the burden of additional expense occasioned by changes in federal law that imposed new water quality standards; as such, it was unlawfully discriminatory to charge new customers hook-up fees based on an allocation of the incremental cost of new plant construction required by growth and passage of the federal act, while not assessing any charges to existing customers. Building Contractors Ass’n v. Idaho Public Utils. Comm’n, 128 Idaho 534, 916 P.2d 1259 (1996).

        On an application by a railroad to abandon a portion of its service and substitute service of another sort in lieu thereof, the burden of proof rests on the railroad to show that the proposed substitute service would be adequate, efficient, just and reasonable. In re Union Pac. R.R., 64 Idaho 597, 134 P.2d 1073 (1943).
    Where the total revenue from passenger trains over a certain branch line for eighteen months was $11,473.80 as against an expense of $23,063.46, the use of the passenger train service by the public being negligible, and there were adequate and efficient means of transportation over another railroad and by bus service, the public utilities commission erred in denying the railroad’s application to discontinue passenger train service and to substitute, in lieu thereof, mixed trains consisting of a passenger car and a baggage car on existing freight trains. In re Union Pac. R.R., 64 Idaho 597, 134 P.2d 1073 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        No fixed rule can be applied in determining whether or not a railroad is entitled to discontinue a portion of its service and substitute in lieu thereof a different class of service, and each case must be considered in the light of all of its facts.

        In determining whether patronage justifies expense of operation of passenger trains on a railroad’s branch line, it is proper to take into consideration the expense of furnishing passenger service, but that is not the most important question, the controlling question being the necessity and reasonableness of the service to the public.

        A railroad was entitled to permission to substitute a caretaker for agency service for community on a branch line having 800 voters, where such substitution would not be a material detriment to the community and would lessen the expense and release a telegraph operator for more necessary service. In re Union Pac. R.R., 64 Idaho 529, 134 P.2d 599 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the service rendered by a railroad is adequate, efficient, just and reasonable as required by statute, it is neither just nor reasonable to impose an unreasonable and unjust economic loss on the railroad, and indirectly, on the public by requiring unnecessary and useless expenditures.

Subject to such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe, such schedules shall be plainly printed in large type and a copy thereof shall be kept by every such carrier readily accessible to and for inspection by the public in every station or office of such carrier where passengers or property are respectively received for transportation when such station or office is in charge of an agent, and in every station or office of such carrier where passenger tickets or tickets for sleeping, parlor car or other train accommodations are sold or bills of lading or waybills or receipts for property issued. Any or all of such schedules kept as aforesaid shall be immediately produced by such carrier for inspection upon the demand of any person.

        In determining whether patronage justified the expense of operating passenger trains on a railroad’s branch line, it was proper to consider the expense of furnishing passenger service, but that was not the most important question; the controlling question being the necessity and reasonableness of the service to the public. In re Union Pac. R.R., 64 Idaho 597, 134 P.2d 1073 (1943).
    In considering the question of whether or not a railroad should be compelled to continue the operation of a branch line passenger service, the entire revenues of the whole system are to be taken into account, and not merely the direct return of the branch line itself, which is sought to be abandoned.

        If passenger service furnished by railroad is in all respects adequate, efficient, just and reasonable as required by statute, it is neither just nor reasonable to impose an unreasonable and unjust economic loss on the railroad, and, indirectly, on the public, to require unnecessary and useless expenditures.

       <p>
        As between classes of service, whether those classes be as between schedules or as between customers within a schedule, valid considerations for rate differentiation are the quantity of the utility used, the nature of the use, the time of use, the pattern of use, the differences in the conditions of service, the costs of service, the reasonable efficiency and economy of operation, the actual differences in the situation of the consumers for the furnishing of the service, contribution to peak load, costs of service on peak demand days, costs of storage and economic incentives; one criterion is not necessarily more essential than another nor is the list of criteria exclusive.

        Furnishing water to one who does not pay regular rate paid by other users of supply is positively prohibited. Rowland v. Kellogg Power & Water Co., 43 Idaho 643, 253 P. 840 (1927).
    An order of the public utility commission imposing a nonrecurring charge of $50.00 per kilowatt on the installation of or conversion to electric space heating after a fixed date exceeded the commission’s authority to fix and regulate rates, since it discriminatorily differentiated between classes of new and old customers without reference to the pattern, nature, and time of usage, quantity, cost of service, or difference in condition of service as between the two classes. Idaho State Homebuilders v. Washington Water Power, 107 Idaho 415, 690 P.2d 350 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of the fact that the commission is not required to create equality of rates among classes of the utility’s customers if the rates set are reasonable, the commission’s order granting a 4.4% increase for residential service, a 10.3% increase for most other rate schedules, and a 16% increase for irrigation and soil drainage pumping service was reasonable and proper where exhibits showed that irrigation users produced a lower rate of return than other customers. Grindstone Butte Mut. Canal Co. v. Idaho Power Co., 98 Idaho 860, 574 P.2d 902 (1978).

        A rate scale under which large volume “firm service” natural gas users pay a minimum monthly charge plus the commodity charge for gas actually used, whereas others including large volume interruptible customers, are credited for the amounts actually used against their minimum monthly charges, so that their bills are the higher of (1) actual use or (2) the minimum charge, and not both, is not an “unreasonable difference” within the meaning of this section and must be sustained.

        A reasonable classification of utility customers may justify the setting of different rates and charges for the different classes of customers; any such difference in a utility’s rates and charges must be justified by a corresponding classification of customers that is based upon factors such as cost of service, quantity of electricity used, differences in conditions of service, or the time, nature and pattern of the use.

       <p>
        The public utilities commission order, which prohibited the water company from collecting any bills more than one month in arrears as of the date of the order, discriminated against those customers who were diligent in the payment of the water bills and was illegal.

        Where cost of servicing all water customers increased due to several factors including passage of a federal act, court held no particular group of customers should bear the burden of additional expense occasioned by changes in federal law that imposed new water quality standards; as such, it was unlawfully discriminatory to charge new customers hook-up fees based on an allocation of the incremental cost of new plant construction required by growth and passage of the federal act, while not assessing any charges to existing customers.

       <p>
        Public utilities commission, in the exercise of its authority to see that rates, both as a whole and for each particular service, are just to the utility and reasonable to the consumer, and nondiscriminatory as between consumers, may not only fix rates for each class, but may classify. Idaho Power Co. v. Thompson, (1927) (various rate-making principles discussed and applied).
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission had authority to fix utility rates which would supersede rates previously fixed by private contract, but, before the commission could increase electric service rates charged to an industrial customer under a special service contract, it was required to find specifically that the different rate was unreasonable and adverse to the public interest. Agricultural Prods. Corp. v. Utah Power & Light Co., 98 Idaho 23, 557 P.2d 617 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The public utilities commission cannot abrogate the terms of a contract in order to create uniform rates unless it first examines all relevant factors of service to comparable customers and expressly finds that a continuation of the rate specified in the contract would be adverse to the public interest. Bunker Hill Co. v. Washington Water Power Co., 98 Idaho 249, 561 P.2d 391 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one of two telephone companies bound by a long-distance toll division agreement issued credit cards to persons outside its own service area who were employed by its parent corporation, the court refused to adopt the position that settlement amounts paid to such company when the credit cards were used outside its service area had the effect of lowering the parent corporation’s rates and, thereby, constituted unreasonable discrimination under this section, since to adopt such a position would give the commission jurisdiction over any revenue producing procedure as long as one customer held stock in the utility. Lemhi Tel. Co. v. Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co., 98 Idaho 692, 571 P.2d 753 (1977).

    Since the commission has power to regulate and fix charges and rates, but a utility is enjoined from establishing rates or charges which are preferential or discriminatory, it follows by implication that the commission’s authority may only be exercised in such a way as to fix nondiscriminatory, and nonpreferential rates and charges.

      Any such property or interest in property hereafter transferred or acquired in violation of this act shall escheat to the state of Idaho. The attorney general of the state shall institute proceedings in the district court of any county in which such property, or any portion thereof, is situated, to have such escheat adjudged and decreed. If the property is operating property, the court shall continue the operation thereof under a receiver appointed by and under the control and supervision of the court, pending final determination of the action and the sale and disposition of the property. When the court has entered judgment escheating the property to the state, the court shall thereupon order a sale of the property, or interest therein, in the same manner as prescribed by the laws of the state of Idaho for the sale of real estate under mortgage foreclosure. Out of the proceeds arising from such sale, any valid liens or claims of third parties shall be paid, and the balance shall be paid into the state treasury for the credit of the school fund [public school permanent endowment fund].

        Section 1 of S.L. 2000, 1st Ex. Sess., § 1 read: “The provision of a safe and reliable supply of electricity in a manner that prohibits the ‘pirating’ of consumers and discourages duplication of facilities is essential to the well-being of Idaho’s citizens and its economy. It was for these and other reasons that the legislature passed the Electric Supplier Stabilization Act in 1970. The legislature has been advised of federal antitrust litigation alleging that conformance with the provisions of this act does not confer federal antitrust immunity upon parties in compliance with the act. The legislature finds that a negative judicial ruling would have the effect of repealing applicable provisions of the act, undercutting the purposes for which this act was enacted. It is and has been the intention of the legislature to confer antitrust immunity upon parties acting in compliance with the act under what is known as the state action doctrine. While the legislature believes that compliance with the existing provisions of this act confers such immunity, it has determined to amend the act to more fully address this issue. The legislature therefore finds that it is in the public interest to enact the following amendments.”

        The electric supplier stabilization act (ESSA) was not intended to provide consumers with an express statutory mechanism by which they would be able to take their disputes with one or more utilities before the public utilities commission (IPUC), nor was it intended to provide an alternative forum for disputes between two public utilities more appropriately heard by the IPUC. Rather, the legislature’s purpose was to vest district courts with jurisdiction to address service territory disputes between utilities and either cooperatives or (later) municipalities not subject to the jurisdiction of the IPUC. Utah Power & Light Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 112 Idaho 10, 730 P.2d 930 (1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 801, 108 S. Ct. 44, 98 L. Ed. 2d 9 (1987).

        State had a significant and legitimate public purpose in passing amended legislation shielding the electric power company from a federal antitrust violation: the prohibiting of unrestrained competition for retail electric customers and the avoidance of the wasteful duplication of electrical suppliers; accordingly, the electricity retailer could not show that the electric power company violated the law in acting in an anti-competitive manner in its dealing with the electricity retailer.

        Feeder Tie Construction.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fact that the feeder tie line was built in accord with various engineering and prudent utility practices does not mean that a court is precluded from considering the electric supplier’s motives for moving it. Otherwise, if an electric supplier seeks to gain service territory all it need do is construct a feeder tie through the territory and then prove that the line has an engineering purpose. Such an approach does not further the purpose of the legislature as set forth in this section. Kootenai Elec. Coop. v. Washington Water Power Co., 127 Idaho 432, 901 P.2d 1333 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though power company did show that it had legitimate reasons for installing the feeder tie through the industrial park, one of its significant purposes was to obtain an advantage over second power company, and, thus, the feeder line cannot be considered an existing service line in order to determine which supplier’s lines are nearest to the new service entrance for selecting which supplier has the right to supply the new consumers. Kootenai Elec. Coop. v. Washington Water Power Co., 127 Idaho 432, 901 P.2d 1333 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the electric supplier stabilization act authorized a power utility to refuse to allow a non-profit cooperative to use the power utility’s transmission facilities, the state action immunity doctrine did not bar the cooperative from bringing an action under the federal antitrust statutes, because the act allows an electric supplier to define its service territory solely by consent and without any state supervision whatsoever.

        Immunity From Federal Antitrust Scrutiny.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The contemporary two-step test for determining whether an alleged state-sponsored restraint of competition is immune from federal antitrust scrutiny is that the challenged restraint must be (1) clearly articulated, and (2) actively supervised by the state. Snake River Valley Elec. Ass’n v. PacifiCorp, 238 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court correctly concluded that the electric supplier stabilization ct (ESSA) clearly expresses a policy to displace competition among electrical suppliers so that the first prong of the two-step test for determining whether an alleged state-sponsored restraint of competition is immune from federal antitrust scrutiny was satisfied, because this prong is satisfied when a state’s policy permits but does not compel anticompetitive conduct. Snake River Valley Elec. Ass’n v. PacifiCorp, 238 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the electric supplier stabilization act does not provide for active supervision of private agreements to divide customers, the second prong of the two-step test for determining whether an alleged state-sponsored restraint of competition is immune from federal antitrust scrutiny was not satisfied, and defendant’s refusal to allow plaintiff to serve its customers was, therefore, not shielded by the state action immunity doctrine. Snake River Valley Elec. Ass’n v. PacifiCorp, 238 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2001).
    State action immunity prevented electricity retailer from asserting a successful claim that the electric power company violated federal antitrust law, as the electricity retailer was prohibited under the law from “pirating” the electric power company’s customers unless the Idaho public utilities commission granted an exception permitting the transfer of present or past customers; since the power to control the division of consumers was controlled entirely by the Idaho public utilities commission, the alleged refusal of the electric power company to “wheel”, that is, allow the electricity retailer to serve customers using the electric power company’s transmission lines, could not be the basis for a federal antitrust action against the electric power company. Snake River Valley Elec. Ass’n v. Pacificorp, 357 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 956, 125 S. Ct. 416, 160 L. Ed. 2d 317 (2004).

        In an action between two electric suppliers regarding who has the right to supply electricity to new consumers, the supplier with the closest “existing service line” to the consumer’s new service entrance is usually entitled to serve the new consumer; however, where evidence shows that a supplier constructed a “feeder tie” in order to obtain an advantage under Idaho electric supplier stabilization act, the feeder tie does not fall within the definition of “existing service line” pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t61c33s61-332A" target="_self">§ 61-332A</a></cite>, regardless of proof that the feeder tie was installed for legitimate reasons. Kootenai Elec. Coop. v. Washington Water Power Co., 127 Idaho 432, 901 P.2d 1333 (1995).
    If an electric supplier had legitimate reasons for constructing its feeder tie, but one of its significant purposes was to obtain an advantage over another electric supplier, then the feeder tie does not meet the definition of “existing service line” under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t61c33s61-332A" target="_self">§ 61-332A</a></cite> and cannot be used as a measuring point for determining which supplier has the right to provide electric service to new consumers.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2000, 1st Ex. Sess., § 1 read: “The provision of a safe and reliable supply of electricity in a manner that prohibits the ‘pirating’ of consumers and discourages duplication of facilities is essential to the well-being of Idaho’s citizens and its economy. It was for these and other reasons that the legislature passed the Electric Supplier Stabilization Act in 1970. The legislature has been advised of federal antitrust litigation alleging that conformance with the provisions of this act does not confer federal antitrust immunity upon parties in compliance with the act. The legislature finds that a negative judicial ruling would have the effect of repealing applicable provisions of the act, undercutting the purposes for which this act was enacted. It is and has been the intention of the legislature to confer antitrust immunity upon parties acting in compliance with the act under what is known as the state action doctrine. While the legislature believes that compliance with the existing provisions of this act confers such immunity, it has determined to amend the act to more fully address this issue. The legislature therefore finds that it is in the public interest to enact the following amendments.”

        Electric power company was entitled to refuse to “wheel”, where it allowed the electricity retailer to deliver electricity to the electricity retailer’s customers through use of the electric power company’s transmission facilities under certain circumstances, and its refusal to do so did not violate federal antitrust law because it was the responsibility of the Idaho public utilities commission, not the electric power company, to determine whether the refusal to wheel violated the law; by the same token, the electricity retailer was prohibited from serving the electric power company’s customers or former customers unless it petitioned the Idaho public utilities commission and the Idaho public utilities commission issued an order allowing this service.

      In the event the annexing municipality has been furnishing electric service to its residents at the time of such annexation, or thereafter commences the furnishing of such service to its residents, nothing in this chapter shall prevent such municipality from extending its service to the annexed or incorporated area, upon the payment of just compensation, as defined in section 7-711, Idaho Code, to such public utility or cooperative serving such area prior to annexation, for any property, real or personal, including damages to the remainder of the system, if any, of such cooperative or public utility, used in distribution, transmission or supply of electrical energy to such area prior to annexation. As used herein, just compensation shall include consideration of new installations necessarily made between the time of annexation or incorporation and final settlement.

       In the event that such voluntary agreement cannot be made within ninety (90) days of the date of incorporation or annexation of such territory served by such cooperative association, then the municipal corporation may, if so determined by unanimous vote of its governing body, submit to the qualified electors of such municipality upon a special ballot to be voted upon at the next regular election of such municipality, the question “Shall portions of the .... of ...., Idaho which have heretofore been served electrical energy by .... become a part of the electrical system of the .... of ...., Idaho. Said areas are generally known and described as follows: (Insert description).”
      </li>

     <p>
      A majority of the votes cast on said special ballot must be in favor of the proposition in order to approve the transaction on the part of the municipal corporation. Further, the cooperative association shall submit either by mail or at an annual or special meeting to its members, at the same time of the municipal election above mentioned, the question of whether or not the board of such cooperative association be authorized to sell to the municipality upon payment of just compensation, to be agreed upon, or if agreement be not reached, upon compensation determined as provided hereinafter. A majority of the votes cast must be in favor of the proposition in order to approve the transaction on the part of the cooperative association. At least 15 days before the vote by the members of the cooperative association, the association shall submit to the municipality a list of members eligible to vote and the municipality is hereby authorized to submit to said members a written statement of the reasons for the transfer to electric service by the municipality.

      If agreement cannot be reached upon the amount of just compensation, the matter shall be submitted to the district court of the county wherein the municipality is located pursuant to procedures of title 10, chapter 12, Idaho Code, for this purpose of fixing and determining the amount of just compensation as hereinbefore defined.
    The court may appoint not more than two (2) experts to advise the court, and the costs of the action, including fees of such experts, shall be taxed equally to the parties.
     </p>

The legislature has been advised of federal antitrust litigation alleging that conformance with the provisions of this act does not confer federal antitrust immunity upon parties in compliance with the act.

        State action immunity prevented electricity retailer from asserting a successful claim that the electric power company violated federal antitrust law, as the electricity retailer was prohibited under the law from “pirating” the electric power company’s customers unless the Idaho public utilities commission granted an exception permitting the transfer of present or past customers; since the power to control the division of consumers was controlled entirely by the Idaho public utilities commission, the alleged refusal of the electric power company to “wheel”, that is, allow the electricity retailer to serve customers using the electric power company’s transmission lines, could not be the basis for a federal antitrust action against the electric power company.

     <p>
      Every public utility, except railroad corporations, shall file with the commission an inventory of all its physical properties within the state, designating the exact location of its property within the several counties of the state; such inventory shall show in detail the cost of construction together with the depreciation charges incident thereto since construction, or may show the cost of replacement of such properties, if in the opinion of the commission the original cost and depreciation charges cannot be obtained: provided, that in the event any public utility refuses or neglects to file such inventory, or the inventory so filed is inaccurate, the commission may send its agents upon the ground and make an inventory as desired by the commission. The entire cost of making such inventory by the agents of the commission shall be paid by the public utility from its profit and loss account and shall not be charged to operating expenses, and such payment shall be made to the treasurer of the state, who shall deposit the same to the credit of the fund provided for the engineering department of said commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every public utility shall file the inventory herein required within six (6) months after the approval of this section by the governor unless for just cause shown the commission may extend such time and shall file new, amended or supplemental inventories at such times thereafter as the commission may require.

     <p>
      Every public utility shall file an annual report with the commission, verified by the oath of an officer thereof. The verification shall be to the best of said official’s knowledge, information and belief. The commission shall prescribe the form of such report and the character of the information to be contained therein, and may from time to time make such changes and such additions in regard to the form and contents thereof as it may deem proper, and on or before January first in each year shall furnish a blank form for such annual reports to every public utility. The contents of such reports and the form thereof shall conform, as nearly as may be, in the case of public utility subject to an act of congress, entitled “An act to regulate commerce,” approved February 4, 1887, and the acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto, to that required by the interstate commerce commission; and the commission may also require the report to contain such additional information as is reasonably practicable for the public utility to furnish in relation to rates or regulations concerning fares, rates, agreements or contracts affecting the same, so far as such rates or regulations pertain to transportation within this state. In case it is unable to give such information, it shall give a good and sufficient reason for such failure. When the report of such corporation is defective, or believed to be erroneous, the commission shall notify the corporation or person to amend the same within the time prescribed by the commission. The originals of the reports subscribed to and sworn to as prescribed by law, shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of April in each year and preserved in the office of the commission. The commission may extend the time for making and filing such report for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days.

        The public utilities commission has no jurisdiction to take away a utility’s freedom of contract (so long as the contract is not inimical to the public interest) and must consider private contracts when involved in the rate-making process; as such, interpretation of contracts, as a general rule, does not fall within the commission’s jurisdiction.

        The Idaho public utilities commission (IPUC) has the authority and the jurisdiction to engage in a case-by-case analysis under applicable statutory law for the standards and requirements pursuant to implementation of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act: thus, all case decisions issued by the IPUC are potentially applicable to, and may have an impact on, a qualifying facility’s project.

        Public utilities commission, in the exercise of its authority to see that rates, both as a whole and for each particular service, are just to the utility and reasonable to the consumer, and nondiscriminatory as between consumers, also may not only fix rates for each class, but may classify. Idaho Power Co. v. Thompson, 19 F.2d 547 (D. Idaho 1927) (valuation for rate-making principles discussed and applied).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonableness of published tariff of carrier is in the first instance a subject of action by the interstate commerce commission or the public utilities commission. Oregon Short Line R.R. v. Teton Coal Co., 35 F.2d 919 (9th Cir. 1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a litigation of reasonable rates between a public utility and a patron, the commission may require the utility to produce records, contracts and papers bearing on the question and may determine the relevancy or competency of all evidence offered. Federal Mining & Smelting Co. v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 26 Idaho 391, 143 P. 1173 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        In exercising the powers and discharging the duties conferred upon the commission by the legislature, it may frequently be necessary for it to reach conclusions upon and make decisions of questions which can only be finally and conclusively adjudicated by the courts, as under the constitution it cannot be deemed invested with judicial powers. Neil v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 32 Idaho 44, 178 P. 271 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although commission cannot exercise judicial powers, it must, in the performance of its duties, exercise judicial functions. Neil v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 32 Idaho 44, 178 P. 271 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        In every case, commission must in first instance decide from evidence before it whether utility with which it seeks to deal is public utility, for unless it is such, commission is without any jurisdiction over it, and this determination can be made only by exercise of judicial functions. Natatorium Co. v. Erb, 34 Idaho 209, 200 P. 348 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission is an arm of legislative authority and not a court of justice within<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. I, § 18.</cite> Natatorium Co. v. Erb, 34 Idaho 209, 200 P. 348 (1921).

        An order in nature of restraining order or injunction issuing from such commission is void. Humbird Lumber Co. v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 39 Idaho 505, 228 P. 271 (1924).

        Public utilities commission had jurisdiction of application of company for a certificate of public convenience and necessity permitting company to transport and distribute natural gas from Canada, even though company might also have to secure a certificate from federal power commission. Application of Trans-Northwest Gas, Inc., 72 Idaho 215, 238 P.2d 1141 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commission has primary jurisdiction in controversy where a plaintiff seeks to compel the furnishing of a service and, in instant case, plaintiff was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. Grever v. Idaho Tel. Co., 94 Idaho 900, 499 P.2d 1256 (1972).
    Where the dispute between two telephone companies stemmed from a “Traffic Agreement” between them concerning long-distance toll division and there was no finding that such contract was adverse to the public interest, the matter involved construction and enforcement of contract rights and lay in the jurisdiction of the courts rather than that of the public utilities commission.

        The public utilities commission had jurisdiction to decide the issues in a petition for a declaratory ruling brought by the department of energy (DOE), as signatory to a three-party agreement with the Idaho Power Company (IPC) and the Utah Power and Light Co. (U. P. & L.) for the furnishing of energy to the national engineering laboratory (INEL), whereby the DOE sought a ruling that upon the exercise of its right to terminate the agreement, IPC would have the right to be the sole supplier of electricity to INEL.

        An order of the public utility commission imposing a nonrecurring charge of $50.00 per kilowatt on the installation of or conversion to electric space heating after a fixed date exceeded the commission’s authority to fix and regulate rates, since it discriminatorily differentiated between classes of new and old customers without reference to the pattern, nature, and time of usage, quantity, cost of service, or difference in condition of service as between the two classes.

        Where a facility of an electric power company was being used to generate power primarily sold at wholesale to companies outside the state, but was installed primarily not to serve customers outside the state, but to serve the present and future demands of the Idaho customers, it was proper to include such facility in the rate base. Idaho Underground Water Users Ass’n. v. Idaho Power Co., 89 Idaho 147, 404 P.2d 859 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to prevent subsidizing interstate sales for resale by Idaho retail customers, the commission was correct in discounting this portion of the utility’s operations in determining intrastate rates assuming that these sales had not previously been discounted in the power company’s original rate increase application. Idaho Power Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 99 Idaho 374, 582 P.2d 720 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where cost of servicing all water customers increased due to several factors including passage of a federal act, court held no particular group of customers should bear the burden of additional expense occasioned by changes in federal law that imposed new water quality standards; as such, it was unlawfully discriminatory to charge new customers hook-up fees based on an allocation of the incremental cost of new plant construction required by growth and passage of the federal act, while not assessing any charges to existing customers.

       <p>
        Absent a legislative pronouncement to the contrary, it is within the public utilities commission’s jurisdictional province to consider in its rate making capacity all relevant criteria, including energy conservation and concomitant concepts of optimum use and resource allocation. Grindstone Butte Mut. Canal Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 102 Idaho 175, 627 P.2d 804 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        As between classes of service, whether those classes be as between schedules or as between customers within a schedule, valid considerations for rate differentiation are the quantity of the utility used, the nature of the use, the time of use, the pattern of use, the differences in the conditions of service, the costs of service, the reasonable efficiency and economy of operation, the actual differences in the situation of the consumers for the furnishing of the service, contribution to peak load, costs of service on peak demand days, costs of storage and economic incentives; one criterion is not necessarily more essential than another nor is the list of criteria exclusive. Grindstone Butte Mut. Canal Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 102 Idaho 175, 627 P.2d 804 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A reasonable classification of utility customers may justify the setting of different rates and charges for the different classes of customers; any such difference in a utility’s rates and charges must be justified by a corresponding classification of customers that is based upon factors such as cost of service, quantity of electricity used, differences in conditions of service, or the time, nature and pattern of the use.

        When any party, be it utility, ratepayer or the state of Idaho, appeals a rate setting order of the public utilities commission to the supreme court, but does not stay the effectiveness of the order by posting bond under the terms of the public utility law, then the rates and charges set forth by the order are final in all respects as service is provided and consumed so long as the order continues in effect.

        The public utilities commission cannot abrogate the terms of a contract in order to create uniform rates unless it first examines all relevant factors of service to comparable customers and expressly finds that a continuation of the rate specified in the contract would be adverse to the public interest. Bunker Hill Co. v. Washington Water Power Co., 98 Idaho 249, 561 P.2d 391 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        No provision in this act gives the commission authority to unilaterally abrogate existing contractual agreements without making the findings required by this section, but, to the contrary, the act recognizes the continued viability of contracts by requiring them to be filed with the commission. United States v. Utah Power & Light Co., 98 Idaho 665, 570 P.2d 1353 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the findings required by this section are made, the commission has authority to determine the rate at which a public utility provides services to a consumer, regardless of whether the utility is specifically designated as the seller in the relevant contractual agreement.

        By attempting to exercise jurisdiction over third parties, and to allocate costs for relocation of electricity transmission facilities to those third parties that had not requested that service, the Idaho public utilities commission exceeded its authority.

        Since the legislature intended to limit the commission’s authority to those practices which affect the rates, fares, tolls, rentals, charges or classifications of the public utility, the ratemaking authority of the commission does not extend to the area of regulating political statements in the absence of a finding that such action by the utilities increases expenses to be borne by the ratepayers.

        Order issued by commission granting increase in electric service rates based upon adjusted test year was not unjust or unreasonable, where it was shown by the applicant utility that use of historical data would have inadequately demonstrated real revenue needs and where the future-year projections were shown to be reasonably reliable and certain.

       </p>
       <p>
        The commission had authority to fix utility rates which would supersede rates previously fixed by private contract, but before the commission could increase electric service rates charged to an industrial customer under a special service contract it was required to find specifically that the different rate was unreasonable and adverse to the public interest.

        The commission could determine a fair rate of return from Idaho intrastate customers by first determining an Idaho intrastate rate base representing Idaho operations producing power to be sold in intrastate commerce and then determining a fair rate of return thereon, or it could determine a fair rate of return from all Idaho operations and then deduct the portion of deficiency reflecting Idaho operations producing power for interstate sales for resale, so long as the commission does not exceed its jurisdiction and provided that the end result of the methods used by the commission to compute a utility’s rate of return produce a “fair, reasonable or sufficient” result. Idaho Power Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 99 Idaho 374, 582 P.2d 720 (1978).
    The determination of what business expenses are to be incurred by a public utility in its operations is ordinarily a matter left within the discretion of the utility’s management, and an inquiry into such expenses by the commission will normally only be extended into whether such expenditures may be classified as “operating expenses” and thus passed on to the utility ratepayers.

        Since the commission has power to regulate and fix charges and rates, but a utility is enjoined from establishing rates or charges which are preferential or discriminatory, it follows by implication that the commission’s authority may only be exercised in such a way as to fix nondiscriminatory, and nonpreferential rates and charges.

      Except upon its explicit finding that the public interest will be served thereby, the commission is hereby prohibited in any order issued after the effective date of this act, from setting rates for any utility that grants a return on construction work in progress or property held for future use and which is not currently used and useful in providing utility service. Except as authorized by this section, any rates granting a return on construction work in progress or property held for future use are hereby declared to be unjust, unreasonable, unfair, unlawful and illegal. When construction work in progress is excluded from the rate base, the commission must allow a just, fair and reasonable allowance for funds used during construction or similar account to be accumulated, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If the commission sets rates for any utility including a return on property held for future use and subsequently determines that such property is not needed to provide utility service, then the commission shall determine whether any gain or loss occurring from the sale or other disposition of the property may be included in the utility’s rates.

        The determination of what business expenses are to be incurred by a public utility in its operations is ordinarily a matter left within the discretion of the utility’s management, and an inquiry into such expenses by the commission will normally only be extended into whether such expenditures may be classified as “operating expenses” and, thus, passed on to the utility ratepayers.

        Public utilities commission, in the exercise of its authority to see that rates, both as a whole and for each particular service are just to the utility and reasonable to the consumer, and nondiscriminatory as between consumers, may not only fix rates for each class, but may also classify.

        Commission has power to fix rates absolutely and, where these exist, competing companies can charge neither more nor less than the rates fixed. Idaho Power & Light Co. v. Blomquist, 26 Idaho 222, 141 P. 1083 (1914).

    Since the commission has power to regulate and fix charges and rates, but a utility is enjoined from establishing rates or charges which are preferential or discriminatory, it follows by implication that the commission’s authority may only be exercised in such a way as to fix nondiscriminatory, and nonpreferential rates and charges.

        An order of the public utility commission imposing a nonrecurring charge of $50.00 per kilowatt on the installation of or conversion to electric space heating after a fixed date exceeded the commission’s authority to fix and regulate rates, since it discriminatorily differentiated between classes of new and old customers without reference to the pattern, nature, and time of usage, quantity, cost of service, or difference in condition of service as between the two classes.

        Where cost of servicing all water customers increased due to several factors including passage of a federal act, court held no particular group of customers should bear the burden of additional expense occasioned by changes in federal law that imposed new water quality standards, as such, it was unlawfully discriminatory to charge new customers hook-up fees based on an allocation of the incremental cost of new plant construction required by growth and passage of the federal act, while not assessing any charges to existing customers.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c05s61-516ol11">
       The legislature finds that the timely review and permitting of electric transmission facilities is critical to the well-being of the citizens and the economy of this state and the region. The legislature further finds that enactment of this section is necessary to promote the public interest. The purpose of this section is for the public utilities commission to determine whether the construction of electric transmission facilities should be designated to receive priority processing by state agencies. This section is not intended to affect a state agency’s decision-making authority to approve, deny or condition an application to construct electric transmission facilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c05s61-516ol12">

         “Electric transmission facilities” means the construction of high voltage transmission lines with an operating level capacity of two hundred thirty thousand (230,000) volts or more and associated substations and switchyards.

      <li id="t61c05s61-516ol13">
       Any person intending to construct eligible electric transmission facilities in Idaho may file an application with the public utilities commission seeking priority designation. An order granting priority designation shall not constitute regulatory approval or bind any state agency. If the commission issues an order granting priority designation, state agencies subsequently involved in the permitting or siting processes for such electric transmission facilities shall be required to give the application priority or immediate attention as it relates to reviews, permits, reports, studies or comments.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c05s61-516ol14">
       In reviewing an application for priority designation, the public utilities commission shall base its findings on whether the proposed construction of electric transmission facilities will:

        <li id="t61c05s61-516ol14a">
         Benefit Idaho customers and the Idaho economy;

        There was substantial evidence in the record to support the commission’s determination that the acquisition adjustment, paid by a public utility in purchasing a former resale customer, was paid merely to recapture accelerated depreciation and investment tax credit, the benefit of which accrued solely to former resale customer’s former ratepayers, and that the limited benefit of the acquisition of the former resale customer’s plant to the Idaho ratepayers did not justify adding the acquisition adjustment to the Idaho rate base.

      The commission shall have power to establish a system of accounts to be kept by the public utilities subject to its jurisdiction, or to classify said public utilities and to establish a system of accounts for each class and to prescribe the manner in which such accounts shall be kept: provided, that the system of accounts to be kept by railroad corporations and common carriers shall conform to the rules and requirements of the interstate commerce commission in all respects. It may also in its discretion prescribe the forms of accounts, records and memoranda to be kept by such public utilities, including the accounts, records and memoranda of the movement of traffic as well as the receipts and expenditures of moneys, and any other forms, records and memoranda which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary to carry out any of the provisions of this act.

      Where the commission has prescribed the forms of accounts, records or memoranda to be kept by any public utility not subject to the provisions of the act of congress entitled “An act to regulate commerce,” approved February 4, 1887, and the acts amendatory thereto, for any of its business, it shall thereafter be unlawful for such public utility to keep any accounts, records or memoranda for such business other than those so prescribed, or those prescribed by or under the authority of any other state or of the United States, excepting such accounts, records or memoranda as shall be explanatory of and supplemental to the accounts, records or memoranda prescribed by the commission.

The commission may from time to time ascertain and determine and by order fix the proper and adequate rate of depreciation of the several classes of property of each public utility. Each public utility shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates so ascertained, determined and fixed, and shall set aside the moneys so provided for out of the earnings and carry the same in a depreciation fund and expend such fund only for such purposes and under such rules and regulations, both as to original expenditure and subsequent replacement as the commission may prescribe. The income from investments of moneys in such public fund shall likewise be carried in such fund.

      No public utility of a class specified in the foregoing section shall henceforth exercise any right or privilege, or obtain a franchise, or permit, to exercise such right or privilege, from a municipality or county, without having first obtained from the commission a certificate that the public convenience and necessity require the exercise of such right and privilege: provided, that when the commission shall find, after hearing, that the public utility has heretofore begun actual construction work, and is prosecuting such work in good faith, uninterruptedly, and with reasonable diligence in proportion to the magnitude of the undertaking, under any franchise or permit heretofore granted, but not heretofore actually exercised, such public utility may proceed to the completion of such work and may after such completion exercise such right and privilege: provided further, that this section shall not be construed to validate any right or privilege now invalid or hereafter becoming invalid under any law of this state, nor impair any vested right in any franchise or permit heretofore granted.

      § 61-538. Pole attachments — Regulation.
     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this section, the term “public utility” includes any person, firm or corporation except a publicly owned utility which owns or controls poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-way used or useful, in whole or in part, for wire communication, and which are not subject to the jurisdiction of the commission under section 61-129, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “cable television company” means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, or joint-stock association, and includes any trustee, receiver, assignee, or personal representative thereof, which transmits television signals for distribution to subscribers of its services for a fee by means of wires or cables connecting its distribution facilities with the customer’s television receiver or the customer’s equipment connecting to the customer’s receiver rather than by transmission of the television signal through the air.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “pole attachment” when used in this section means any wire or cable for the transmission of cable television, and any related device, apparatus, or auxiliary equipment, installed upon any pole or in any telegraph corporation, telephone corporation, electrical corporation or communications right-of-way, duct, conduit or other similar facilities owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by one or more public utilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature hereby finds that many public utilities have, through a course of conduct covering many years, made available space on and in their poles, ducts, conduits, and other support structures for use by the cable television industry for pole attachment service, and that the provision of such pole attachment service by such public utilities is and has been a public utility service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a public utility and a cable television company are unable to agree upon the rates, terms or conditions for pole attachments or the terms, conditions or cost of production of space needed for pole attachments, then the commission shall establish and regulate the rates, terms and conditions, and cost of providing space needed for pole attachments so as to assure a public utility the recovery of not less than all the additional costs of providing and maintaining pole attachments nor more than the associated capital cost and operating expenses of the public utility attributable to that portion of the pole, duct, or conduit used for the pole attachment including a share of the required support and clearance space. In determining and fixing the rates, terms and conditions, the commission shall consider the interest of the customers of the attaching cable television company, the public utility upon which the attachment is made as well as the customers of the public utility. To the extent applicable, the procedures set forth in title 61, Idaho Code, shall apply under the provisions of this section.

        § 61-603. Witnesses — Attendance — Fees — Mileage.
       </h3>
       <p>
        The commission and each commissioner shall have power to administer oaths, certify to all official acts, and to issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, waybills, books, accounts, documents and testimony in any inquiry, investigation, hearing or proceeding in any part of the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each witness who shall appear, by order of the commission or a commissioner, shall receive for his attendance the same fees allowed by law to a witness in civil cases, in the district court, and mileage at ten cents (10¢) for every mile of travel one (1) way by the nearest generally traveled route in going to the place where the attendance of a witness is required, which amount shall be paid by the party at whose request such witness was subpoenaed.
       </p>
       <p>
        When any witness who has not been required to attend at the request of any party shall be subpoenaed by the commission, his fees and mileage shall be paid from the funds appropriated for the use of the commission in the same manner as other expenses of the commission are paid: provided, that the commission may at its discretion refuse to allow the mileage and attendance of any witness subpoenaed before it that is in the employ of any public utility defined in this act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any witness subpoenaed except one whose fees and mileage may be paid from the funds of the commission, may at the time of service, demand the fee to which he is entitled for travel to and from the place at which he is required to appear and one (1) day’s attendance. If such witness demands such fees at the time of service, and they are not at that time paid or tendered, he shall not be required to attend before the commission or commissioner, as directed in the subpoena, unless the commission shall by order indorsed on the subpoena require any such witness to attend, irrespective of the fact that such mileage and attendance are not paid on demand. All fees or mileage to which any witness is entitled under the provisions of this section may be collected by action therefor instituted by the person to whom such fees are payable. No witness furnished with free transportation shall receive mileage for the distance he may travel on such free transportation.

      § 61-604. Witnesses — District court may compel attendance — Procedure.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The district court in and for the county, or city and county in which any inquiry, investigation, hearing or proceeding may be held by commission or any commissioner shall have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses, the giving of testimony and the production of papers, including waybills, books, accounts and documents as required by any subpoena issued by the commission or any commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission or the commissioner before whom the testimony is to be given or produced, in case of the refusal of any witness to attend or testify or produce any papers required by such subpoena, may report to the district court in and for the county, or city and county, in which the proceeding is pending, by petition, setting forth that due notice has been given of the time and place of attendance of said witness, or the production of said papers, and that the witness has been summoned in the manner prescribed in this act, and that the witness has failed and refused to attend or produce the papers required by the subpoena, before the commission or commissioner, in the cause or proceeding named in the notice and subpoena, or has refused to answer questions propounded to him in the course of such proceeding, and ask an order of said court compelling the witness to attend and testify or produce said papers before the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court, upon the petition of the commission or such commissioner, shall enter an order directing the witnesses to appear before the court at a time and place to be fixed by the court in such order, the time to be not more than ten (10) days from the date of the order, and then and there show cause why he has not attended and testified or produced said papers before the commission. A copy of said order shall be served upon said witness. If it shall appear to the court that said subpoena was regularly issued by the commission or a commissioner and regularly served, the court shall thereupon enter an order that said witness appear before the commission or said commissioner at the time and place fixed in said order, and testify or produce the required papers, and upon failure to obey said order, said witness shall be dealt with as for contempt of court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The remedy provided in this section is cumulative and shall not be construed to impair or interfere with the power of the commission or a commissioner to enforce the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, and to punish for contempt in the same manner and to the same extent as [a] court of record.

        Abuse of Discretion.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The public utility commission abused its discretion in refusing to compensate the intervenor for the hours of the expert witness and attorney for producing evidence that was stricken from the record and a settlement agreement that was not relevant to the resolution of the case. Idaho Fair Share v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 113 Idaho 959, 751 P.2d 107 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the factors in paragraphs (a) through (d) in subsection (2) are connected by the word “and,” the commission must find that all four listed factors exist in order to award expenses under this section. Thus, where the commission finds that an intervenor’s participation did not materially contribute to the commission’s decision, there is no showing that the commission abused its discretion in denying the requested intervenor’s expenses. Bldg. Contrs. Ass’n v. Idaho PUC, 151 Idaho 10, 253 P.3d 684 (2011).

        Denial of landowner’s request for intervenor funding was appropriate, because the landowner’s request was untimely, as the Idaho public utility commission explicitly announced when intervenor funding requests were due, and, although the landowner and the landowner’s attorney were present at the announcement, the landowner did not timely file a request for intervenor funding with the commission.

       No public utility shall raise any existing rate, fare, toll, rental or charge or so alter any existing classification, contract, practice, rule, service or regulation as to result in an increase in any rate, fare, toll, rental or charge, under any circumstances whatsoever, except upon a showing before the commission and a finding by the commission that such increase is justified.

The commission shall provide reasonable notice that it intends to conduct a hearing or other proceeding concerning the propriety of such new tariff, schedule, rate, fare, toll, rental, charge, classification, contract, practice, rule, service or regulation. Pending the subsequent hearing or proceeding and decision thereon, such new tariff, schedule, rate, fare, toll, rental, charge, classification, contract, practice, rule, service or regulation shall not go into effect.

       The period of suspension of such new tariff, schedule, rate, fare, toll, rental, charge, classification, contract, practice, rule, service or regulation shall not extend beyond thirty (30) days when such new tariff, schedule, rate, fare, toll, rental, charge, classification, contract, practice, rule, service or regulation would otherwise go into effect, pursuant to section 61-307, Idaho Code, unless the commission in its discretion extends the period of suspension for an initial period not exceeding five (5) months, nor unless the commission after a showing of good cause on the record grants an additional sixty (60) days. Prior to the expiration of said periods of suspension the commission may, with the consent in writing signed by the party filing such new tariff or schedule, permanently or further suspend the same.

        An accelerated rate of recovery of company’s demand side management program expenditures, programs designed to help reduce energy consumption, would not increase the company’s authorized rate of return; therefore, the public utilities commission was pursuing its statutory authority when it adopted abbreviated proceedings to account for this single item expense of the company.

        Where a general rate increase application incorporated revenue figures resulting from a proposed rate increase due to a specific project with revenue figures used for the general rate increase and where no administrative rule provided that a defective application might be dismissed rather than merely returned, the application was not patently deficient and the commission was not expressly authorized by statute or administrative rule to reject such application.

      For any telephone corporation which provides telecommunication services pursuant to both title 61, Idaho Code, and title 62, Idaho Code, the commission may, or at the request of a telephone corporation shall, establish procedures for allocation of costs between telecommunication services provided pursuant to title 61, Idaho Code, and telecommunication services provided pursuant to title 62, Idaho Code. Such allocations shall reasonably reflect how joint-use facilities are utilized, provide reasonable stability for telephone corporations to do business planning and pricing and minimize the cost of accounting and record keeping to the extent possible. In developing such allocation methods, the commission may adopt procedures which are based on gross allocation factors derived from relative changes in total intrastate telecommunication service revenues or expenses or other measures of relative change between the provision of telecommunication services subject to title 61, Idaho Code, and telecommunication services subject to title 62, Idaho Code. The commission shall have authority to establish just and reasonable rates for all telecommunication services which remain subject to title 61, Idaho Code, and for basic local service in accordance with the provisions of chapter 6, title 62, Idaho Code.

        Collateral Attack.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff, a large “firm service” consumer of gas sought to attack interpretation of defendant public utility’s rate tariff that such large “firm service” consumers must pay both a demand charge for the amount of gas it would have a right to demand each month and a commodity charge for the amount actually used, with no credit of the one against the other, this was not an impermissible collateral attack on the commission order granting the tariff, but a request that the commission enforce the terms of the rate tariffs adopted. Utah-Idaho Sugar Co. v. Intermountain Gas Co., 100 Idaho 368, 597 P.2d 1058 (1979).
       </p>

        A complaint, which challenges the procedures by which a rate increase application subsequently considered and in part approved by the commission was submitted, is an impermissible collateral attack on the commission’s order which concluded that case.

       </p>
       <p>
        Contention by large “firm service” gas customer that defendant-supplier had erred in pro-rating its bill for month that new tariff went into effect on assumption gas consumption had been uniform when, in fact, the bulk of the gas had been used prior to the time the new schedule became effective, resulting in an error of almost $45,000.00, was not an impermissible collateral attack on the commission order granting the new tariff, but a permissible challenge to implementation of that order. Utah-Idaho Sugar Co. v. Intermountain Gas Co., 100 Idaho 368, 597 P.2d 1058 (1979).
    A challenge by a power company to the public utility commission’s authority to promulgate intervenor funding rules pursuant to the public utilities regulatory policies act, 16 U.S.C.S. § 2601, could be made even though there was no direct appeal from the order adopting those rules, since this section does not prohibit collateral attack when the issuing agency lacks jurisdiction over the matter considered.

       After an order has been made by the commission, any corporation, public utility or person interested therein shall have the right, within twenty-one (21) days after the date of said order, to petition for reconsideration in respect to any matter determined therein. Within seven (7) days after any corporation, public utility or person has petitioned for reconsideration, any other corporation, public utility, or person may cross-petition for reconsideration in response to any issues raised in any petition for reconsideration. Cross-petitions for reconsideration may be granted if any petition for reconsideration to which they respond is granted on the issues to which the cross-petition is directed, but cross-petitions for reconsideration will be denied when the petitions for reconsideration to which they are directed are denied.

       Within twenty-eight (28) days after the filing of a petition for reconsideration the commission shall determine whether or not it will grant such reconsideration, and make and enter its order accordingly. If reconsideration be granted, said order shall specify how the matter will be reconsidered and whether any cross-petitions for reconsideration will be granted. The matter must be reheard, or written briefs, comments or interrogatories must be filed, within thirteen (13) weeks after the date for filing petitions for reconsideration. If reconsideration is ordered, the commission must issue its order upon reconsideration within twenty-eight (28) days after the matter is finally submitted for reconsideration.

       A petition for such reconsideration shall not excuse any corporation, public utility or person from complying with or obeying any order or any requirement of any order of the commission or operate in any manner, to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof, except as the commission may by order direct. If after reconsideration, including consideration of matters arising since the making of the order, the commission shall be of the opinion that the original order or any part thereof is in any respect unjust or unwarranted or should be changed, the commission may abrogate or change the same. An order made after any such reconsideration, abrogating or changing the original order, shall have the same force and effect as an original order, and shall not affect any right or the enforcement of any right arising from or by virtue of the original order.

        Developer of small power production “qualifying facility’s” (QF) argument that public utilities’ unrelenting opposition to QF’s facility meant that QF should be allowed to adjust its fuel project location and size to reflect delays caused by public utilities’ refusal to comply with federal regulations under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, 16 U.S.C.S. § 2601, was not a proper subject for appeal as such relief was not originally requested of the Idaho public utilities commission.

        In an appeal from Idaho public utilities commission, matters may not be raised for the first time on appeal, and where objections were not raised in a petition for rehearing, they will not be considered by the supreme court. The rationale behind the statute is to afford the commission the opportunity to rectify any mistake before presenting the issue to the supreme court. Eagle Water Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 130 Idaho 314, 940 P.2d 1133 (1997).

        Adequacy of plaintiff’s remedy by appeal is not impaired by reason of the fact that in taking an appeal plaintiff incurs the risk of having supreme court affirm action of commission, or by reason of the fact that it also has an alternative remedy by ignoring any order which commission may make against it and forcing the commission to try out the issue again before the district court.

       <p>
        In exercising its powers and discharging its duties the public utilities commission reaches conclusions and makes decisions which can be finally adjudicated only by the courts. Since the constitution limits the jurisdiction of the supreme court to the review of decisions of district courts or the judges thereof, it cannot entertain an appeal directly from the public utilities commission. Neil v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 32 Idaho 44, 178 P. 271 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        In pursuance of formal similar statute, water company has right to appeal from decision of commission fixing value of its property for rate making. Boise Artesian Water Co. v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 40 Idaho 690, 236 P. 525 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to appeal and pending a rehearing before the public utilities commission, the supreme court has no jurisdiction to issue a stay order fixing rates, and where such rates are confiscatory the district court with its general and unlimited jurisdiction as ordained by the constitution has jurisdiction to stay the order. Joy v. Winstead, 70 Idaho 232, 215 P.2d 291 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that order denying applications was made without prejudice does not affect its finality; it concludes the rights of the parties in the application proceeding and is final and appealable. In re Citizens Utils. Co., 82 Idaho 208, 351 P.2d 487 (1960).

       <p>
        Such interlocutory orders as order overruling demurrer to complaint in intervention; order granting prayer of complaint in intervention that certain property be excluded in arriving at valuation; and order denying application for rehearing thereon, all made prior to order fixing valuation, are not final orders that are appealable.

        Where 18 warehouse companies filed a petition with the public utilities commission to amend existing schedules of rates by increasing charges for handling grains, peas, and seeds, and commission only increased charges on peas, and withheld further action until a uniform system of accounting was established, which would be ordered forthwith, such order was final, and same is appealable.

        An assignment of error that the commission failed to make specific findings as to certain matters material to the establishment of a rate was procedural rather than substantive in character and, if not included in the petition for rehearing filed with the commission, will not be considered by the supreme court on appeal.

        In fixing a reasonable and just rate for a public utility, the commission and the court on review must bear in mind the provisions of the state constitution that no person shall be deprived of his property without due process of law, and that private property may not be taken for public use until a just compensation shall be paid therefor.

       <p>
        No right of appeal to district court exists. However, due process requires that courts stay an order of a commission which may result in confiscation and irreparable loss. Such action by the court must not be a judicial review of the merits of the controversy, i.e., the correctness of the rates, but merely is to stay the order until final adjudication. Joy v. Winstead, 70 Idaho 232, 215 P.2d 291 (1950).

        Public utilities commission, in passing upon applications of rival gas companies for certificates of convenience for distribution of natural gas within the state, should have considered the fact that one of the companies was equipped to furnish the gas to a large section of the state whereas the other companies were not able to do so. In re Intermountain Gas Co., 77 Idaho 188, 289 P.2d 933 (1955).

        The public utilities commission could not base its order granting a certificate of convenience to a natural gas company on the possible available supply of natural gas to the state in the future, since this constituted speculation.

        In a proceeding before the public utilities commission relative to the granting of a certificate of convenience for distribution of natural gas in the state, where it appeared that the applicant, whose plan was sound, was backed by ample financial and technical support, and it could distribute to a wide area of the state, but the commission granted the application of a rival company whose plan was not sound and who could not distribute over a wide area, the order of the commission was set aside and the proceeding remanded to the commission for further action.

        Questions of cost of equity and rate of return are matters which raise extremely complicated issues, and deciding these questions is a function of the Idaho public utilities commission, as these questions are within the commission’s area of expertise. The adoption of a standard for determining the reasonableness of payments to an affiliate raises many complex issues which are best left for the commission to deal with initially.

        Where evidence presented to the public utilities commission is competent and substantial in support of the findings made and there has been no clear abuse of discretion, the supreme court of Idaho is constrained to affirm those findings. Grindstone Butte Mut. Canal Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 102 Idaho 175, 627 P.2d 804 (1981); Hayden Pines Water Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 111 Idaho 331, 723 P.2d 875 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence for the purpose of judicial review of an administrative agency’s action requires more than a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the agency’s determination, though something less than the weight of the evidence; in other words, the substantial competent evidence rule requires a court to determine whether the agency’s findings of fact are reasonable. Hayden Pines Water Co. v. Idaho Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 111 Idaho 331, 723 P.2d 875 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The public utilities commission’s finding that meter installation fees may never be booked as income (and reduction of revenue requirement) was not supported by substantial competent evidence, where the water utility would not be able to recoup the accompanying loss in future rates, and the IRS, the Uniform System of Accounts for Small Water Utilities, and the commission itself in the past had all permitted utilities to treat those fees as income.

       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that the service afforded by other common carriers in the area after the discontinuance of the train was adequate to meet the public needs, also that high quality highways provided direct routes in various directions for private automobiles, the court would take into consideration the limited public use of the passenger service, the expense and net loss to the railroad in finding that the commission had not abused its discretionary power in entering the order authorizing the discontinuance of operation of certain trains.

        In order to prevent subsidizing interstate sales for resale by Idaho retail customers, the commission was correct in discounting this portion of the utility’s operations in determining intrastate rates assuming that these sales had not previously been discounted in the power company’s original rate increase application.

        The commission could determine a fair rate of return from Idaho intrastate customers by first determining an Idaho intrastate rate base representing Idaho operations producing power to be sold in intrastate commerce and then determining a fair rate of return thereon, or it could determine a fair rate of return from all Idaho operations and then deduct the portion of deficiency reflecting Idaho operations producing power for interstate sales for resale, so long as the commission does not exceed its jurisdiction and provided that the end result of the methods used by the commission to compute a utility’s rate of return produce a “fair, reasonable or sufficient” result.

      In case the court stays or suspends any order or decision lowering any rate, fare, toll, rental, charge or classification, the commission, upon the execution and approval of said suspending bond, shall forthwith require the public utility affected under the penalty of the immediate enforcement of the order or decision of the commission (pending the review and notwithstanding the suspending order) to keep such accounts verified by oath, as may in the judgment of the commission suffice to show the amounts being charged or received by such public utility, pending the review, in excess of the charges allowed by the order or decision of the commission, together with the names and addresses of the corporations or persons to whom overcharges will be refundable in case the charges made by the public utility, pending the review, be not sustained by the court.

Upon the final decision by the court, all moneys which the public utility may have collected, pending the appeal in excess of those authorized by such final decision, together with interest in case the court ordered the deposit of such moneys in a bank or trust company, shall be promptly paid to the corporations or persons entitled thereto, in such manner and through such methods of distribution as may be prescribed by the commission. If any such moneys shall not have been claimed by the corporations or persons entitled thereto within one (1) year from the final decision of the court, the commission shall cause notice to such corporation or person to be given by publication, once a week for two (2) successive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in the city of Boise, and such other newspaper or newspapers as may be designated by the commission, said notice to state the names of the corporations or persons entitled to such moneys and the amount due each corporation or person. All moneys not claimed within three (3) months after the publication of said notice shall be paid by the public utility under the direction of the commission, into the state treasury for the benefit of the general fund.

     <p>
      For the purpose of ascertaining the matters and things specified in section 61-523[, Idaho Code], concerning the value of the property of public utilities, the commission may cause a hearing or hearings to be held at such time or times and place or places as the commission may designate. Before any hearing is had the commission shall give the public utility affected thereby at least thirty (30) days’ written notice, specifying the time and place of such hearing and such notice shall be sufficient to authorize the commission to inquire into the matters designated in this section and in said section 61-523[, Idaho Code], but this provision shall not prevent the commission from making any preliminary examination or investigation into the matters herein referred to, or from inquiring into such matters in any other investigation or hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      All public utilities affected shall be entitled to be heard and to introduce evidence at such hearing or hearings. The evidence introduced at such hearing shall be reduced to writing and certified under the seal of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall make and file its findings of fact in writing upon all matters concerning which evidence shall have been introduced before it which in its judgment have bearing on the value of the property of the public utility affected. Such findings shall be subject to review by the court of this state in the same manner and within the same time as other orders and decisions of the commission. The findings of the commission so made and filed, when properly certified under the seal of the commission, shall be admissible in evidence in any action, proceeding or hearing before the commission or any court, in which the commission, the state or any officer, department or institution thereof or any county, city and county, municipality or other body politic and the public utility affected may be interested whether arising under the provisions of this act or otherwise, and such findings, when so introduced, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated as to the date therein stated under conditions then existing, and such facts can only be controverted by showing a subsequent change in conditions bearing upon the facts therein determined.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may from time to time cause further hearings and investigations to be had for the purpose of making revaluations or ascertaining the value of any betterments, improvements, additions or extensions made by any public utility subsequent to any prior hearing or investigation, and may examine into all matters which may change, modify or affect any finding of fact previously made, and may at such time make findings of fact supplementary to those theretofore made. Such hearings shall be had upon the same notice and shall be conducted in the same manner, and the findings so made shall have the same force and effect as is provided herein for such original notice, hearing and findings: provided, that such findings made at such supplemental hearings or investigations shall be considered in connection with and as a part of the original findings, except in so far as such supplemental findings shall change or modify the findings made at the original hearing or investigation.

      § 61-705. Summary proceedings by commission.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the commission shall be of the opinion that any public utility is failing or omitting or about to fail or omit, to do anything required of it by law, or by any order, decision, rule, direction or requirement of the commission under the provisions of this act, or is doing anything or about to do anything, or permitting anything or about to permit anything to be done, contrary to or in violation of law or of any order, decision, rule, direction or requirement of the commission, under the provisions of this act, it shall direct the attorney of the commission to commence an action or proceeding in the district court in and for the county, or city and county, in which the cause or some part thereof arose, or in which the corporation complained of, if any, has its principal place of business, or in which the person, if any, complained of, resides, in the name of the people of the state of Idaho, for the purpose of having such violations or threatened violations stopped and prevented, either by mandamus or injunction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The attorney of the commission shall thereupon begin such action or proceeding by petition to such district court, alleging the violation or threatened violation complained of and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or injunction.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify a time not exceeding twenty (20) days, after the service of the copy of the petition, within which the public utility complained of must answer the petition, and in the meantime said public utility may be restrained. In case of default in answer, or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances of the case. Such corporations or persons as the court may deem necessary or proper to be joined as parties in order to make its judgment, order or writ effective, may be joined as parties. The final judgment in such action or proceedings shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that the writ of mandamus or injunction issue or be made permanent as prayed for in the petition, or in such modified or other form as will afford appropriate relief.
     </p>
     <p>
      An appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court from such final judgment in the same manner and with the same effect, subject to the provisions of this act, as appeals are taken from judgments of the district court in other actions for mandamus or injunction.

     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that the efficient and safe distribution of electricity is critical to the well-being of the citizens and the economy of the state, including the business of agriculture, and that this enactment is necessary for the protection of the public welfare and benefit. The legislature also finds that the potential impact of stray current or voltage on dairy cows is a matter of interest and concern to dairy producers with dairies situated near and served by a multi-grounded wye electrical distribution system, which is the type of distribution system used by utilities in this state. Scientific research has established a level of stray current or voltage, at or below which no effect on a dairy cow’s behavior, health or milk production has been shown. To provide for the continued, safe and efficient availability of electricity while addressing complaints regarding stray current or voltage, it is necessary and appropriate to: establish a uniform preventive action level; establish uniform procedures and protocols for measurements of stray current or voltage; require, when necessary, that the sources of stray current or voltage be identified; require, when necessary, adequate remediation; and establish procedures for handling complaints.

      Within six (6) months of the effective date of this chapter, the commission shall promulgate temporary rules and proposed rules, referred to collectively in this chapter as “commission rules,” establishing uniform procedures and protocols for the measurement of stray current or voltage. The commission shall review the rules from time to time, or upon petition to the commission, to ensure that the uniform procedures and protocols continue to be the most scientifically and technologically accurate and reliable means of detecting stray current or voltage. If the commission determines that it is appropriate to revise the rules because of advances in science or technology, it is encouraged to do so by the adoption of temporary rules which would confer a benefit on utilities and dairy producers by making better science available for the measurement of stray current or voltage. Any measurements of stray current or voltage not made in compliance with commission rules shall be inadmissible before the commission or in any civil action. The commission rules shall be applicable to dairy producers, utilities, and all persons or entities involved in any way in the measurement or remediation of stray current or voltage in this state.

     <p>
      Any dairy producer in this state who claims that its dairy cows are being affected by any form or type of electrical energy allegedly attributable to a utility including, without limitation, stray current or voltage, shall, as a condition precedent to commencing any civil action against the utility, provide written notice thereof to the utility. The notice shall specify why the dairy producer believes its dairy cows are being affected by electrical energy attributable to the utility. Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice, the utility shall take measurements at cow contact points at the dairy producer’s dairy to identify the existence and magnitude of stray current or voltage, if any. If the utility finds a level of stray current or voltage at cow contact points in excess of the preventive action level, the utility shall thereafter promptly identify that portion, if any, of the stray current or voltage that is attributable to the utility’s distribution system. If that portion of the stray current or voltage at cow contact points attributable to the utility’s distribution system exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the preventive action level, the utility shall, within five (5) business days, commence and diligently pursue to completion, remedial procedures which shall reduce, and are reasonably likely to sustain, that portion of the stray current or voltage at cow contact points attributable to the utility’s distribution system to fifty percent (50%) or less of the preventive action level.

     <p>
      On or before April 15th of each year the commission shall determine the proportionate assessment that all railroad corporations, and all other public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, shall bear to the amount which will be required to defray the expense of the commission for supervision and regulation of such railroad corporations and other public utilities during the ensuing fiscal year; such determination shall be based upon a consideration of the time and expense devoted to the supervision and regulation of each such class of railroad corporations and other public utilities during the preceding calendar year, including salaries and wages of the commissioners and employees and all other necessary and lawful expenditures of the commission. Thereupon the commission shall apportion the assessment thus determined to be required of all railroad corporations and all other public utilities, to each such class thereof, respectively, in proportion to their respective gross operating revenues derived from intrastate utility business in Idaho for the preceding calendar year, except that the maximum fee payable shall not exceed:

    The 1999 amendment, by ch. 289, § 4, added subsection (1), added the subsection designators (2) and (3), substituted “the public utilities commission fund” for “said Public Utilities Commission Fund” throughout the section, and made minor punctuation changes throughout the section; in subsection (2), deleted “a fund, which is hereby created, to be known as” following “custodian of”, substituted “this chapter” for “this act”, and substituted “. Moneys” for “; moneys”; in subsection (3) deleted “collected under this act” following “Any moneys”, divided the former first sentence of subsection (3) into the current first and second sentences by substituting “in this chapter. Remaining funds shall” for “in this act and shall”, deleted “subject to the provisions of this act” following “other public utilities”, and substituted “against each railroad corporation and public utility”; for “against each of them, respectively,” in the last sentence.

      § 61-1104. Certificate of public convenience and necessity required — Public utility commission.
     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be unlawful for any air carrier, as the term is defined in this act, to operate any aircraft in transportation without having first obtained from the commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity covering such operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      A certificate may be issued to a qualified applicant authorizing the whole or any part of his operations covered by the application made to the commission in accordance with the provisions of this act, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able properly to perform the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of this act and the requirements, rules and regulations of the commission thereunder, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the certificate is, or will be, required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.
     </p>
     <p>
      In considering the public convenience and necessity, the commission shall in consultation with the director of the Idaho transportation department, prior to the issuance of a certificate, consider the effect of such proposed air carrier operation upon the operations of any authorized air carrier then operating over the routes or in the territory sought. The mere existence of an air carrier in the territory sought who possesses authority similar to that sought by the applicant shall not be sufficient cause to deny the issuance of the certificate.
     </p>
     <p>
      In awarding certificates of public convenience and necessity, the commission shall take into consideration the business experience of the particular air carrier in the field of air operations, the financial stability of the carrier, the insurance coverage of the carrier, type of aircraft which the carrier would employ, proposed routes and minimum schedules to be established, whether the carrier could economically give adequate service to the communities involved, the necessity for the service, and any other factors which may affect the public interest.

     <p>
      Any person seeking authorization for a consolidation, merger, purchase, lease, operating contract or acquisition of control shall file an application with the commission and a duplicate with the director, and thereupon the commission shall notify all persons known to have a substantial interest in the proceedings of the time and place of the public hearing. The commission, after consultation with the director, shall by order authorize such consolidation, merger, purchase, lease, operating contract or acquisition of control upon such terms and conditions as it shall find to be just and reasonable, after hearing, if the consolidation, merger, purchase, lease, operating contract or acquisition of control is in the public interest. The commission shall not authorize, however, any consolidation, merger, purchase, lease, operating contract or acquisition of control which would result in creating a monopoly or monopolies and thereby restrain competition, or jeopardize another air carrier not a party to the consolidation, merger, purchase, lease, operating contract, or acquisition of control. In any case in which the commission, after consultation with the director, determines that the transaction which is the subject of the application does not affect the control of an air carrier, does not result in creating a monopoly or monopolies, and does not tend to restrain competition, and determines that no person disclosing a substantial interest is currently requesting a hearing, the commission, after notice of its intention to dispose of such application without a hearing, may determine that the public interest does not require a hearing and may by order authorize or not authorize such transaction.

      Title IV of the Americans with disabilities act, public law 101-336, requires that on or before July 26, 1993, telephone corporations providing interstate or intrastate telephone services provide telecommunications relay services (TRS) for individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech-impaired that will allow them to engage in telephone communication in a manner functionally equivalent to that of individuals without hearing loss or speech impairments. The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to provide for the appointment of a TRS administrator who can coordinate TRS services and assist the state in applying for certification of the state TRS program by the federal deadline of October 1, 1992. This certification, if approved by the federal communications commission, will allow every telephone corporation providing intrastate service in Idaho to meet its obligations under federal law by participating in the state telecommunications relay services program.

      <p>
       It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this chapter to provide a process by which the recovery of large energy rate increases caused by fuel or power cost adjustments, purchased gas adjustment tracker rates, commodity tracker rate adjustments or purchased power tracker rates will be facilitated by the issuance of bonds. This legislation will provide electric and gas utilities with a mechanism for recovery of their increased costs while leveling the rate impact of such increase on the utilities’ customers. The legislature believes that this type of securities legislation is in the public interest but should not be considered as an endorsement of, or intended to provide, a mechanism for restructuring of the utility industry in the state of Idaho.

    (8) “Energy cost property” means the irrevocable, vested property right created pursuant to this chapter and one (1) or more energy cost financing orders including, without limitation, the right, title and interest of a public utility, assignee or other issuer of energy cost recovery bonds to all revenues, collections, claims, payments, money or proceeds of or arising from an energy cost recovery charge or constituting the costs of recovering, reimbursing, financing or refinancing energy cost amounts and acquiring energy cost property (including the costs of issuing, servicing and retiring energy cost recovery bonds) and all rights to obtain adjustments to such energy cost recovery charge pursuant to the terms of this chapter and any energy cost financing order; provided that any right that a public utility has in the energy cost property before the sale or other transfer of such property or any other rights created under this chapter or created in any energy cost financing order and assignable under section 61-1504, Idaho Code, or assignable pursuant to an energy cost financing order shall be only a contract right. Energy cost property shall, upon its sale or other transfer, constitute a current and irrevocably vested property right notwithstanding the fact that the value of such property right will depend upon consumers using electricity and/or the public utility performing certain services.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       (9) “Energy cost recovery bond” means any instrument, pass-through certificate, note, bond, debenture, certificate of participation, collateral trust certificate, beneficial interest or other evidence of indebtedness or ownership issued by a public utility, assignee or other issuer pursuant to an energy cost financing order and an executed indenture, security agreement or other similar agreement of a public utility, assignee or other issuer that is secured by or payable from energy cost bond charges or energy cost property.

       § 61-1503. Energy cost recovery bonds.
      </h3>
      <p>
       An electric or gas public utility may apply to the commission for an energy cost financing order requesting that certain energy cost amounts be recovered through the sale of energy cost recovery bonds.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol11">
        A public utility may apply to the commission at any time and from time to time for an authorization that it may recover ECA amounts and other energy cost amounts through the issuance of energy cost recovery bonds. The public utility may apply to the commission for such an authorization either in a separate proceeding or in a proceeding considering the authorization of an ECA. Upon such an application, if the commission finds that the public interest would be better served if the energy cost amounts were recovered through the issuance of energy cost recovery bonds over the term of such bonds than if the ECA amounts were recovered over a period of one (1) year, assuming a conventional financing of such amounts, the commission shall issue an energy cost financing order to allow the public utility to recover energy cost amounts.
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol12">
        The energy cost financing order shall detail the energy cost amount to be recovered and the period of time in which the energy cost recovery is to occur. The commission shall not issue an energy cost financing order unless the total of the then (a) existing ECAs, (b) existing energy cost bond charges, and (c) the amount identified by the electric or gas public utility in its application for such financing order as the additional ECA that would be required absent an issuance of energy cost recovery bonds pursuant to such financing order, exceeds a minimum amount (expressed in cents per kilowatt-hour or cents per therm) approved by the commission and in effect at the time of the issuance of such energy cost financing order. Each public utility shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to its first application for an energy cost financing order and at five (5) year intervals thereafter, file with the commission a proposal as to what such minimum amount should be and the commission shall, within twenty-eight (28) days of such filing, issue an order regarding its determination of such proposed minimum amount. Energy cost recovery bonds shall have an expected maturity date no later than five (5) years after the date of issuance, and scheduled principal payments on such bonds shall, to the extent practicable, be scheduled to be made in approximately equal amounts during each year of the term of such bonds. Energy cost recovery bonds shall have a legal maturity date no later than seven (7) years after the date of issuance. Energy cost bond charges shall remain in effect until all energy cost recovery bonds and all energy cost amounts have been paid in full. The commission may issue successive energy cost financing orders permitting subsequent issuances of energy cost recovery bonds.
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol13">
        An energy cost financing order may be issued only upon the application of a public utility and shall become effective only in accordance with its terms and conditions. The public utility may withdraw its application if it disagrees with any of the terms and conditions of the energy cost financing order or any modification thereof within fourteen (14) days of issuance of the energy cost financing order or of such modification. The energy cost financing order shall specify the estimated amount of the energy cost bond charge and the formula for determining the amount of the charge that from time to time will be sufficient to recover all energy cost amounts.
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol14">
        After issuance of an energy cost financing order, the public utility may sell, assign or otherwise transfer or pledge energy cost property or cause the energy cost recovery bonds to be issued, provided it may defer, postpone or refrain from effecting the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or issuance, in which case no energy cost bond charge shall be imposed unless and until such energy cost recovery bonds are issued. If energy cost recovery bonds are not issued within one (1) year after the energy cost financing order becomes final and nonappealable, the authorization contained in the energy cost financing order shall expire, provided that a public utility may apply for an extension or renewal of an energy cost financing order.
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol15">
        The energy cost financing orders, the energy cost amounts and the energy cost bond charges that have been determined by the commission shall be irrevocable and binding upon the commission. The commission shall not have authority either by rescinding, altering or amending the energy cost financing order or otherwise to, either directly or indirectly, revalue or revise for ratemaking purposes the energy cost amounts. Once the commission determines the energy cost bond charge, it cannot determine in a later proceeding that the energy cost bond charge is unjust or unreasonable or in any way reduce or impair the value of energy cost property either directly or indirectly by taking the energy cost bond charge into account when setting other rates for the public utility; nor shall the amount of revenues arising with respect thereto be subject to reduction, impairment, postponement or termination. The state of Idaho does hereby pledge to and agree with the owners of energy cost property and with any energy cost recovery bondholders that neither the state nor any of its agencies, including the commission, shall (by legislative action, ballot initiative or other similar process) limit, alter, restrict or impair the energy cost amounts, the energy cost bond charge, the energy cost property, the energy cost financing orders or any rights thereunder or ownership thereof or security interest therein or in any way impair the rights or remedies of any energy cost recovery bondholders until the energy cost recovery bonds, including all principal, interest, premium, costs, expenses and arrearages thereon, are fully met and discharged, provided nothing contained in this chapter shall preclude such a limitation, alteration, restriction or impairment if and when adequate provision (including without limitation provision for the payment of principal and interest when due) shall be made by law for the protection of the energy cost recovery bondholders. The state of Idaho does hereby acknowledge that any energy cost recovery bondholders may and will rely on this pledge and agreement and that they would be irreparably harmed by any such limitation, alteration, restriction or impairment without such adequate provision. The public utility and any assignee or other issuer are authorized to include this pledge and agreement in the energy cost recovery bonds and the documents relating thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the commission shall approve such adjustments to the energy cost bond charges as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery of all energy cost amounts that are the subject of the pertinent energy cost financing order.
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol16">
        Energy cost recovery bonds issued under this chapter and any energy cost financing orders do not constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any political subdivision thereof and do not constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the state or any of its political subdivisions, but are payable solely from the funds provided therefor. All the bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: “Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of Idaho is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond.” This paragraph shall in no way preclude bond guarantees or enhancements pursuant to this chapter, nor shall it preclude the payment of compensation for any breach of the state’s pledge contained in subsection (5) of this section or for any action or failure to act by the commission in contravention of this chapter.
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol17">
        The commission shall establish procedures for the expeditious processing of any application for energy cost financing orders, including the approval or disapproval of any such orders within forty-five (45) days of the application. In addition, each energy cost financing order shall specify a procedure for making adjustments to the energy cost bond charge that is the subject of the order, such adjustments to be expeditiously approved by the commission, so as to ensure the timely payment of principal and interest on the related energy cost recovery bonds and the recovery of all other energy cost amounts. Such procedure shall provide for adjustments to be made, upon application by the affected public utility, assignee or other issuer, at least annually and at such additional intervals, if any, as are specified in the order. The public utility, assignee or other issuer shall file its application for any such adjustment with the commission at least thirty (30) days before the date on which the adjustment is requested to become effective, and the commission shall approve or disapprove such application no later than thirty (30) days after the date of such filing. In addition, upon application by a public utility, assignee or other issuer after an energy cost financing order has been issued and has become effective, the commission may:
    (a) Authorize the making of adjustments to the energy cost bond charge at more frequent intervals than those specified in such order; and/or
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol18">
        The energy cost bond charge shall be treated as a charge for utility services for purposes of determining both the credit and collection standards to which customers (including, for purposes of this subsection, any parties that provide billing or collection services for energy supplied to another customer) may be held subject under applicable state law and the remedies for nonpayment that are available to a public utility under applicable state law, and such treatment shall not alter the tax, accounting or other intended characteristics of any energy cost bond financing.
       </li>
       <li id="t61c15s61-1503ol19">
        An energy cost bond charge shall constitute energy cost property when, and to the extent that, an energy cost financing order authorizing such energy cost bond charge has become effective in accordance with this chapter, and the energy cost property shall thereafter continuously exist as property for all purposes with all of the rights and privileges of this chapter for the period and to the extent provided in the energy cost financing order, but in any event until the energy cost recovery bonds are paid in full, including all principal, interest, premium, costs and arrearages thereon.

        Any surplus energy cost bond charge collections in excess of the amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest, credit enhancement and all other fees, costs and charges with respect to energy cost recovery bonds shall be used to benefit customers in such manner as the commission may reasonably determine except to the extent that such use would result in a recharacterization of the tax, accounting or other intended characteristics of the financing.

        (9) This subsection sets forth the terms by which a consensual security interest can be created and perfected in the energy cost property. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission with respect to any series of energy cost recovery bonds on or prior to the issuance of the series, there shall exist a statutory lien as provided in this subsection. Upon the effective date of the energy cost financing order, there shall exist a first priority lien on all energy cost property then existing or thereafter arising pursuant to the terms of the energy cost financing order. This lien shall arise by operation of this subsection automatically without any action on the part of the public utility, any assignee or other issuer, or any other person. This lien shall secure all obligations, then existing or subsequently arising, to the holders of the energy cost recovery bonds issued pursuant to the energy cost financing order, the trustee or representative for the holders, and any other entity specified in the energy cost financing order. The persons for whose benefit this lien is established shall, upon the occurrence of any defaults specified in the pertinent energy cost financing order, have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under chapter 9, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce this statutory lien in the energy cost property. This lien shall attach to the energy cost property regardless of who shall own, or shall subsequently be determined to own, the energy cost property including any public utility, any assignee or other issuer, or any other person. This lien shall be valid, perfected, and enforceable against the owner of the energy cost property and all third parties upon the effectiveness of the energy cost financing order without any further public notice; provided however, that any person may, but shall not be required to, file a financing statement in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. Financing statements so filed may be “protective filings” and shall not be evidence of the ownership of the energy cost property. A perfected statutory lien in energy cost property is a continuously perfected lien in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting liens shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. In addition, the commission may require, in the energy cost financing order creating the energy cost property, that, in the event of default by the public utility in payment of revenues arising with respect to energy cost property, the commission and any successor thereto, upon the application by the beneficiaries of the statutory lien, and without limiting any other remedies available to the beneficiaries by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the beneficiaries of revenues arising with respect to the energy cost property.

     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this chapter to authorize the public utilities commission to approve certain cost reduction charges or rates as a method of financing or refinancing costs incurred or to be incurred by electric and gas utilities that will accrue benefits to Idaho consumers through reduced utility rates. The legislature believes that this type of securities legislation is in the public interest but should not be considered as endorsement of, or intended to provide, a mechanism for restructuring of the utility industry in the state of Idaho.

     <ol>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol11">
       A public utility may apply to the commission for a cost reduction order authorizing the recovery of approved costs through the imposition and collection of a cost reduction rate.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol12">
       A public utility may apply to the commission from time to time for a cost reduction order in a manner prescribed by the commission, in separate proceedings for this purpose or in connection with a general rate case. Such application may also include a request for authority to issue and sell cost reduction instruments to be secured by or payable from the cost reduction rate that results from such cost reduction order or the cost reduction property created by this chapter and the cost reduction order related to such cost reduction rate. Upon such an application, if the commission finds that the public interest would be served if the approved costs were recovered through a cost reduction rate, the commission shall issue a cost reduction order to allow the public utility to recover the approved costs through a cost reduction rate and may also provide authority to issue and sell cost reduction instruments.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol13">
       A cost reduction order shall detail the approved costs to be recovered and the period of time in which recovery of the approved costs is to occur. A cost reduction order shall specify the amount of the cost reduction rate and the method for determining the amount of the cost reduction rate that from time to time will be sufficient to recover all approved costs. Cost reduction rates shall remain in effect until all approved costs have been paid in full.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol14">
       A cost reduction order may be issued only upon the application of a public utility and shall become effective only in accordance with its terms and conditions. A public utility may withdraw its application for a cost reduction order if it disagrees with any of the terms and conditions of the order within fourteen (14) days of service of a final order on the public utility. A public utility shall effect the withdrawal of its application by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the commission within such time period. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or preclude other remedies that may be available to the public utility under applicable law.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol15">
       No public utility shall be treated as having acted unreasonably or imprudently by reason of its failure to apply for a cost reduction order, by reason of its withdrawal of an application for a cost reduction order, or by reason of its failure to arrange for the issuance of cost reduction instruments pursuant to a cost reduction order.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol16">
       Upon issuance of a cost reduction order, a public utility may sell, assign or otherwise transfer or pledge cost reduction property created by this chapter and the applicable cost reduction order, and if authorized by the particular cost reduction order, a public utility or an assignee may issue or cause to be issued cost reduction instruments.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol17">
       Any cost reduction order, and the approved costs and the cost reduction rates that have been authorized by the commission in such cost reduction order, shall be irrevocable and binding upon the commission. The commission shall not have authority either by rescinding, altering or amending a cost reduction order or otherwise to, either directly or indirectly, revalue or revise for ratemaking purposes the approved costs or the cost reduction rates. Once the commission authorizes a cost reduction rate, it cannot determine in a later proceeding that the cost reduction rate is unjust or unreasonable, or in any way reduce or impair the value of related cost reduction property, either directly or indirectly, by taking the cost reduction rate into account when setting other rates for the public utility; nor shall the amount of revenues arising with respect thereto be subject to reduction, impairment, postponement or termination. The state of Idaho does hereby pledge to and agree with the owners of cost reduction property and with any cost reduction instrument holders that neither the state nor any of its agencies, including the commission, shall (by administrative or legislative action, ballot initiative or other similar process) limit, alter, restrict or impair the approved costs, the cost reduction rate, the cost reduction property, the cost reduction orders or any rights thereunder or ownership thereof or security interest therein or in any way impair the rights or remedies of any cost reduction instrument holders. The state does hereby acknowledge that any cost reduction instrument holders may and will rely on this pledge and agreement and that they would be irreparably harmed by any such limitation, alteration, restriction or impairment without such adequate provision.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol18">
       Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commission will from time to time, and no less frequently than annually, approve adjustments to the cost reduction rates as may be necessary to ensure timely and complete recovery of all approved costs that are the subject of the pertinent cost reduction order.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol19">
       Subject to the foregoing limitations, the commission has the same authority with respect to a proposed cost reduction rate as it has with regard to any other tariff, schedule or classification the effect of which is to change any rate or charge, including, without limitation, the power granted by chapter 6, title 61, Idaho Code, to conduct a hearing concerning a proposed cost reduction rate and the reasonableness and justness thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c16s61-1603ol110">
       The commission shall establish procedures for the expeditious processing of any application for cost reduction orders and adjustments thereto, including the approval or disapproval of any such orders within forty-five (45) days of the application therefor.

       (9) This section sets forth the terms by which a consensual security interest can be created and perfected in cost reduction property. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission with respect to any series of cost reduction instruments on or prior to the issuance of the series, there shall exist a statutory lien as provided in this section. Upon the effective date of the cost reduction order, there shall exist a first priority lien on all cost reduction property then existing or thereafter arising pursuant to the terms of the cost reduction order. This lien shall arise by operation of this section automatically without any action on the part of the public utility, any assignee or other issuer, or any other person. This lien shall secure all obligations, then existing or subsequently arising, to the holders of the cost reduction instruments issued pursuant to the cost reduction order, the trustee or representative for the holders, and any other entity specified in the cost reduction order. The persons for whose benefit this lien is established shall, upon the occurrence of any defaults specified in the pertinent cost reduction order, have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under chapter 9, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce this statutory lien in the cost reduction property. This lien shall attach to the cost reduction property regardless of who shall own, or shall subsequently be determined to own, the cost reduction property including any public utility, any assignee or other issuer, or any other person. This lien shall be valid, perfected, and enforceable against the owner of the cost reduction property and all third parties upon the effectiveness of the cost reduction order without any further public notice; provided however, that any person may, but shall not be required to, file a financing statement in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. Financing statements so filed may be “protective filings” and shall not be evidence of the ownership of the cost reduction property. A perfected statutory lien in cost reduction property is a continuously perfected lien in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting liens shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. In addition, the commission may require, in the cost reduction order creating the cost reduction property, that, in the event of default by the public utility in payment of revenues arising with respect to cost reduction property, the commission and any successor thereto, upon the application by the beneficiaries of the statutory lien, and without limiting any other remedies available to the beneficiaries by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the beneficiaries of revenues arising with respect to the cost reduction property.

       The provisions of this chapter apply to the construction or modification of transmission facilities located in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the secretary of the United States department of energy under section 1221 of the energy policy act of 2005. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the efficient and timely review of applications for the siting of electric transmission facilities in federally designated national interest electric transmission corridors. The review is intended to facilitate participation from all interested entities and individuals and to avoid federal preemption.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c17s61-1701ol12">
       The legislature finds that the efficient and safe transmission of electricity is critical to the well-being of the citizens and the economy of this state, the region and the nation. The legislature further finds that enactment of this chapter is necessary for the protection of the public welfare and public interest.
