        The peculiar nature of a legal malpractice action requires the action to proceed as a suit within a suit; therefore, an award of attorney fees pursuant to the underlying antitrust action constitutes a part of the measure of damages in the malpractice case and must be submitted as part of the proof of damages under the antitrust claim; it is not sufficient to file a post-trial affidavit of costs and fees under Idaho R.

    The federal courts have placed a “gloss” on the contract element of the federal statute requiring also that there be a “unity of purpose” between the contracting parties to violate the antitrust laws.

       <p>
        The basic elements necessary to prove the charge of attempted monopoly under this section are: (1) a specific intent by the defendant to monopolize, and (2) overt acts by the defendant which create a dangerous probability that the intended monopoly will be achieved. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).

       <p>
        There are three essential elements in every private antitrust action: (1) a violation of the antitrust law, (2) direct injury to the plaintiff from such violations, and (3) damages sustained by the plaintiff. Therefore, a finding of a violation by itself does not result in liability. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).
    Injury arising out of a defendant’s antitrust violation is an element of proof in establishing civil liability under this section, since injury to a person’s business is essential to the cause of action. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no set degree of percentage of market power which must be possessed in order for a defendant to be dangerously close to achieving a monopoly. Rather, in order to determine whether there is a dangerous probability that a monopoly will be achieved, the extent of market power must be evaluated in conjunction with prevailing market conditions, as well as the business policies and performance of the defendant. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where even liberally construing the record, defendant could have had not more than 24 percent of the insulation market, and in light of the highly competitive nature of the market involved, the claim of attempted monopoly had to fail.

        — Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Generally, since there is rarely any direct evidence of specific intent to monopolize, its existence may be inferred from anticompetitive conduct of the defendant. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding that a defendant has engaged in a particular predatory or illegal act, such as selling below cost, is not the equivalent of finding specific intent, but is merely a basis from which such intent may be inferred; and isolated or occasional instances of selling below cost, while predatory or illegal in nature, do not necessarily indicate a specific intent to monopolize. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence of specific intent to monopolize must be determined by weighing all of the circumstances in the particular case, including the nature of the conduct, its consistency and duration, the conditions of the market, and characteristics of the defendant.

       <p>
        To meet the minimum requirement of proof in market exclusion cases in which lost profits are sought, the plaintiff must normally produce evidence falling into one of the following categories: (1) comparison of plaintiff’s performance before and after the wrongful conduct under otherwise similar conditions, (2) comparison of performance of plaintiff’s business, with comparable business in an unrestrained market otherwise comparable to plaintiff’s market or (3) loss of specific business or customers. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an antitrust case, there was no justification for trial court’s determination that the gross revenues of the defendant company and subsidiary provided a reasonable foundation for calculating the lost profits of plaintiffs, as such a method of figuring damages assumed, without any support in the record, that the defendant’s operation would not have won any portion of the market absent antitrust violations, and that the plaintiffs had the capacity to assimilate all of the business which defendant performed, and that plaintiffs would have won that business over other insulators who chose not to participate in the action. Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 646 P.2d 988 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The factfinder may not determine damages by mere speculation and guesswork, and there must be a reasonable foundation established by the evidence from which the factfinder can calculate the amount of damages. It will be enough if the evidence shows the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference, although the result be only approximate. Pope v.

This section strikes the balance between free competition and fair competition by offering relief only where a company can show a competitor’s intent to drive the company out of business, rather than simply an intent to compete.

Any person failing to give such notice shall be barred during the pendency of such action from commencing an action in his or her own name for the injury alleged in such action and the final judgment in such action shall be res judicata as to any claim which could be brought by such person under this act based on the facts alleged or proven in such action.

The consent decree may include a stipulation for the payment of civil penalties, the attorney general’s reasonable expenses, investigative costs and attorney’s fees, an agreement to pay damages or to allow for restitution of money, property or other things received in connection with a violation of this chapter, and agreed to injunctive provisions.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Idaho legislature finds that medical billing practices have little visibility to Idaho citizens. As a result, consumers often find themselves in collection actions for debts they were unaware of, from health care providers whom they do not recognize. Once in collections, current Idaho law enables excessive attorney’s fees and fails to provide judges with clear guidance to combat abuses of the collections process. This chapter shall govern the fair collection of debts owed to health care providers.

      <li id="t48c05s48-503ol12">
       The goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is used and the mode or manner in which the mark is used on or in connection with such goods or services and the class in which such goods or services fall;
      </li>
      <li id="t48c05s48-503ol13">
       The date when the mark was first used anywhere and the date when it was first used in this state by the applicant or a predecessor in interest; and
      </li>
      <li id="t48c05s48-503ol14">
       A statement that the applicant is the owner of the mark, that the mark is in use, and that, to the knowledge of the person verifying the application, no other person has registered, in this state, or has the right to use such mark either in the identical form thereof or in such near resemblance thereto as to be likely, when applied to the goods or services of such other person, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The secretary of state may also require a statement as to whether an application to register the mark, or portions or a composite thereof, has been filed by the applicant or a predecessor in interest in the United States patent and trademark office; and, if so, the applicant shall provide full particulars with respect thereto including the filing date and serial number of each application, the status thereof and, if any application was finally refused registration or has otherwise not resulted in a registration, the reasons therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The application shall be signed by the applicant or by a member of the firm or an officer of the corporation or association applying.
     </p>
     <p>
      The application shall be accompanied by a drawing or one (1) specimen showing the mark as actually used, complying with such requirements as the secretary of state may specify.

       The applicant shall provide any additional pertinent information requested by the secretary of state including a description of a design mark and may make, or authorize the secretary of state to make, such amendments to the application as may be reasonably requested by the secretary of state or deemed by the applicant to be advisable to respond to any rejection or objection.

       The secretary of state may require the applicant to disclaim an unregisterable component of a mark otherwise registerable, and an applicant may voluntarily disclaim a component of a mark sought to be registered. No disclaimer shall prejudice or affect the applicant’s or registrant’s rights then existing or thereafter arising in the disclaimed matter, or the applicant’s or registrant’s rights of registration on another application if the disclaimed matter is distinctive of the applicant’s or registrant’s goods or services.

       If the applicant is found not to be entitled to registration, the secretary of state shall advise the applicant thereof and of the reasons therefor. The applicant shall have a reasonable period of time specified by the secretary of state in which to reply or to amend the application, in which event the application shall then be reexamined. This procedure may be repeated until: (a) the secretary of state finally refuses registration of the mark; or (b) the applicant fails to reply or amend within the specified period, whereupon the application shall be deemed to have been abandoned.

       If the secretary of state finally refuses registration of the mark, the applicant may appeal the denial of such registration to the district court in and for Ada county. The court may compel registration of the mark, but without cost to the secretary of state, on proof that all the statements in the application are true and that the mark is otherwise entitled to registration.

       In the instance of applications concurrently being processed by the secretary of state which seek registration of the same or confusingly similar marks for the same or related goods or services, the secretary of state shall grant priority to the applications in order of filing. If a prior-filed application is granted a registration, the other application or applications shall then be rejected. Any rejected applicant may bring an action for cancellation of the registration upon grounds of prior or superior rights to the mark, in accordance with the provisions of section 48-509, Idaho Code.

        In an action by a veterinarian against a national pet store chain for trademark infringement related to the phrase, “Where Pets are Family,” the court found no likelihood of confusion and, therefore, granted summary judgment to the pet store chain; although the parties indisputably sold related goods and services and the pet store chain’s extensive advertising gave it the ability to overwhelm any public recognition and goodwill that the veterinarian had developed in the mark, the court noted that both parties use the trademark merely as a tagline to their distinctive business names, that their marketing efforts were concentrated in different media, that there was no evidence of actual confusion, and reasonably attentive pet owners should be particularly attentive in selecting a veterinarian for their family pets and, thus, were likely to perceive the differences between a veterinary clinic and the pet store chain.

The court may also order that any such counterfeits or imitations in the possession or under the control of any defendant in the case be delivered to an officer of the court, or to the complainant, to be destroyed. The court, in its discretion, may enter judgment for an amount not to exceed three (3) times such profits and damages and may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit to the prevailing party in such cases where the court finds the other party committed the wrongful acts with knowledge or in bad faith or otherwise, as the circumstances of the case may warrant.

        This section was amended by two 2002 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2002 amendment by ch. 358, § 1, effective July 1, 2002, in subsection (19), inserted “to the ultimate consumer” following “by selling or offering to sell”, substituted “pharmaceuticals” for “medicine” following “fuel or food”; added “In determining whether a price is exorbitant or excessive, the court shall take into consideration the facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to:”; added subsections 19(a), (b), (c); and added the last sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2002 amendment by ch. 361, § 2, effective March 27, 2002, added the semicolon at the end of subsection (18) and added subsection (19).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 54, deleted “subsection (37) of” preceding “section 28-41-301, Idaho Code” near the end of subsection (18).

        Section 1 of S.L. 2002, ch. 361 provides: “The Legislature finds that during emergencies or disasters, some persons may take unfair advantage of consumers by greatly increasing prices for essential goods and services. While the pricing of consumer goods and services is generally best left to the marketplace under ordinary conditions, when a declared state of emergency or disaster results in abnormal disruptions of the market, the public interest requires that excessive and unjustified increases in the prices of essential consumer goods and services be prohibited.”

        The term “this act” in the last paragraph refers to S.L. 2002, Chapter 358, which is compiled as this section only. The reference probably should be to “this chapter,” being chapter 6, title 48, Idaho Code.

        The state need not prove in a consumer protection action that consumers in fact relied upon deceptions or misrepresentations made by the defendant and that the defendant’s acts were a proximate cause of the defendant’s acquisition of moneys from consumers in order for the state to obtain restitutionary relief for Idaho consumers.

In any action brought by a person under this section, the court shall award, in addition to the relief provided in this section, reasonable attorney’s fees to the plaintiff if he prevails.

        The determination of who is a prevailing party, for the purpose of receiving an award of attorney fees, is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court; that determination will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion has occurred. Where the trial court has exercised its discretion after a careful consideration of the relevant factual circumstances and principles of law, and without arbitrary disregard for those facts and principles of justice, that exercise of discretion has not been abused and will not be disturbed.

        In action by homeowners against seller of hydronic heating systems, trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that homeowners were the prevailing parties despite the fact that majority of homeowners’ claims were dismissed, that jury awarded damages amounting to only 3% of the recovery sought, and that seller prevailed on counterclaim against builder.

       <p>
        The amount to be awarded as attorney’s fees was properly identified as a matter of discretion; however, the trial court improperly exercised its discretion in calculating the amount of fees on the basis of prevailing “theories” and the concomitant fractionating of the contingent fee. Nalen v. Jenkins, 113 Idaho 79, 741 P.2d 366 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intent of this section is to compensate a prevailing plaintiff for the costs of bringing an action under this chapter, and to further that purpose, attorney fees should be allowed on appeal for the prevailing plaintiff. Nalen v. Jenkins, 113 Idaho 79, 741 P.2d 366 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that an award is made to a party does not necessarily require the amount to be limited to the party-attorney agreement; the statute provides for the award of an objectively “reasonable” fee, and such a fee may be higher or lower than what the party must pay to the attorney under their agreement. Nalen v. Jenkins, 114 Idaho 973, 763 P.2d 1081 (Ct. App. 1988).

        The trial court did not err in determining that the plaintiffs had to suffer “ascertainable damages” under subsection (1) of this section before they could be considered prevailing parties and awarded attorney fees. Shurtliff v. Northwest Pools, Inc., 120 Idaho 263, 815 P.2d 461 (Ct. App. 1991).
    In denying attorney fees to both parties, the trial court did not venture outside the boundaries of its discretion, nor did it act inconsistently with the legal standards applicable to the award of attorney fees; the trial court’s decision to require each party to bear its own fees appeared to have been reached through the exercise of reason. Israel v. Leachman, 139 Idaho 24, 72 P.3d 864 (2003).

        In a property sale dispute in which one ruling in favor of the sellers was overturned on appeal, while several other rulings in favor of the sellers were affirmed, the buyer was not entitled to attorney fees on appeal because he was not the prevailing party.

      <li id="t48c06s48-610ol11">
       In the administration of this chapter, the attorney general may accept an assurance of voluntary compliance with respect to any method, act or practice deemed to be violative of the provisions of this chapter from any person who has engaged or was about to engage in such method, act or practice. Any such assurance shall be in writing and be filed with and subject to the approval of the district court of the county in which the alleged violator resides or has his principal place of business or of the district court of Ada County and shall be deemed an order of the court enforceable by contempt proceedings.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c06s48-610ol12">
       Such assurance of voluntary compliance shall not be considered an admission of violation for any purpose.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c06s48-610ol13">
       The assurance of voluntary compliance shall provide for the discontinuance by the person entering into the same of any method, act or practice alleged to be a violation of this chapter, and it may include a stipulation for the payment by such person of reasonable expenses, investigative costs and attorney’s fees incurred by the attorney general. The recovered expenses, costs and fees shall be remitted to the consumer protection account [consumer protection fund] created in section 48-606, Idaho Code, and shall be used for the furtherance of the attorney general’s duties and activities under this chapter. The assurance may also include: a stipulation for payment to consumers of actual damages or for restitution of money, property, or other things received from consumers in connection with a violation of the provisions of this chapter; and a stipulation for specific performance.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c06s48-610ol14">
       A violation of such assurance of voluntary compliance shall prima facie establish that the person subject thereto knows, or in the exercise of due care should know, that he has in the past violated or is violating the provisions of this chapter.

        Because this chapter sets forth a clear procedure and time limit for objecting to an investigative demand, the defendant’s failure to object or respond to the investigative demand within the statutory time period was without a reasonable basis in fact or law. Since the state clearly prevailed on appeal, the state was awarded costs and attorney fees. State ex rel. Lance v. Hobby Horse Ranch Tractor & Equip. Co., 129 Idaho 565, 929 P.2d 741 (1996).

        To determine whether debtors have a timely Disclosure Statement ICPA claim, the court must first determine when their alleged cause of action “accrued.” In Idaho, a cause of action accrues when one party may sue another. Before an “accrued” claim arises under the ICPA, a person must purchase or lease goods or services, and thereby suffer an ascertainable loss. In addition, the ascertainable loss must be the result of a practice declared unlawful by the ICPA. Beach v. Bank of Am. (In re Beach), 447 B.R. 313 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2011).

        Where the process claimed as a trade secret was not contained in the general knowledge of those in the industry, the district court’s findings of fact, when applied to the “generally known” and “readily ascertainable” tests, supported the conclusion that there was a protectable trade secret.

        A party may not use another’s trade secret, even with independent improvements or modifications, so long as the product or process is substantially derived from the trade secret. This requires the court to apply the test for misappropriation under subsection (2) of this section. Basic Am., Inc. v. Shatila, 133 Idaho 726, 992 P.2d 175 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its Idaho trade secrets act misappropriation claim; however, the injunction was limited to the sale of machines that matched those designed for and purchased by plaintiff or any machine or any other disclosure that would reveal the trade secrets of plaintiff.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant had possession of computer programming source code through his work for plaintiff company (and created much of it), he acquired the code under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; thus, if defendant used or disclosed the trade secret, he was liable for misappropriation. Justmed, Inc. v. Byce, 600 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court reversed and remanded the judgment in favor of plaintiff company on the company’s misappropriation claim because, besides filing for a copyright and threatening to withhold the source code, defendant made no other “use” of the source code. While defendant threatened misappropriation, his actions did not rise to the level of misappropriation. Justmed, Inc. v. Byce, 600 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2010).

        Six factors that can be used to show that given information is a trade secret: (1) the extent to which the information is known outside the plaintiff’s business; (2) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the value of the information to him and his competitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended by him in developing the information; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others. Wesco Autobody Supply v. Ernest, 149 Idaho 881, 243 P.3d 1069 (2010); La Bella Vita, LLC v. Shuler, 158 Idaho 799, 353 P.3d 420 (2015).

       <p>
        In an action against former employees, who resigned and went to work for a competitor, customer lists, lists showing customer buying preferences, the history of customer purchases, and custom paint formulas are trade secrets. Wesco Autobody Supply v. Ernest, 149 Idaho 881, 243 P.3d 1069 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Genuine issues of fact existed as to whether a baby shower list and a salon’s client list and client-related information were taken or used for the competitor’s benefit, where there was testimony showing that the baby shower list was at least partially derived from the salon’s official client list and also used as a primary source in the creation of the competitor’s client list. La Bella Vita, LLC v. Shuler, 158 Idaho 799, 353 P.3d 420 (2015).

        A sanitation company’s action alleging that a county and a competitor misappropriated its trade secrets was dismissed because the dollar amount of the company’s proposal did not constitute a trade secret. The company did not make reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the information. By failing to object to the opening of its proposal after its representative knew proposals were being opened in public, the company failed to take reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. Walco, Inc. v. County of Idaho, 159 Idaho 131, 357 P.3d 856 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a sanitation company’s proposal could not qualify as a trade secret once it was opened and the dollar amount was read aloud at a public meeting, without objection from the company’s representative, a county commissioner’s possession of the proposal after the meeting could not constitute misappropriation. Walco, Inc. v. County of Idaho, 159 Idaho 131, 357 P.3d 856 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        A sanitation company did not make reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the information in its bid when it did not object to the bid being opened in a public meeting; the sealing of a letter the company’s counsel sent to the county was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that the company took reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy of the envelope’s contents. Walco, Inc. v. County of Idaho, 159 Idaho 131, 357 P.3d 856 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        A list containing the names and addresses of individuals, some of whom were customers of former employer, an insurance company, did not constitute a trade secret, where the list was almost wholly generated from alternative and independent sources and contained generally known information. Trumble v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., — Idaho —, 456 P.3d 201 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature did not intend the Idaho Trade Secrets Act to be read so broadly that merely hiring a competitor’s employee constitutes acquiring a trade secret, because employees will naturally take with them the skills, training and knowledge acquired from previous employment. Trumble v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., — Idaho —, 456 P.3d 201 (2019).

        Plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its Idaho trade secrets act claim; however, the injunction was limited to the sale of machines that matched those designed for and purchased by plaintiff or any machine or any other disclosure that would reveal the trade secrets of plaintiff.

        Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined; therefore, while damages for misappropriation of a trade secret were inappropriate because of the lack of “use” or “disclosure,” as contemplated in the context of trade secret protection, the district court could grant an injunction against defendant’s threatened use or disclosure of the source code if appropriate.

         Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator’s unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.

       Every manufacturer of motor vehicles sold and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty shall maintain sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close to all areas in which its motor vehicles are sold to carry out the terms of the warranties or designate and authorize as service and repair facilities independent repair or service facilities reasonably close to all areas in which its motor vehicles are sold to carry out the terms of the warranties. As a means of complying with the provisions of this subsection, a manufacturer may, in a town or city where there is not a franchise market representative, enter into warranty service contracts with independent service and repair facilities.

      § 48-903. Manufacturer’s duty to refund or replace.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t48c09s48-903ol11">
       If the manufacturer, its agents, or its authorized dealers are unable to conform the new motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition which impairs the use or market value of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either replace the new motor vehicle with a comparable motor vehicle or accept return of the vehicle from the consumer and refund to the consumer the amount the consumer paid for the vehicle, inclusive of the value of any trade-in, not to exceed one hundred five percent (105%) of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of the motor vehicle. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price shall include all manufacturer installed options. The one hundred five percent (105%) cap shall include the cost of any options or other modifications arranged, installed, or made by the manufacturer’s agent, or its authorized dealer within thirty (30) days after the date of original delivery. The manufacturer shall refund to the consumer all other charges including, but not limited to, sales or excise tax, license fees and registration fees, reimbursement for towing and rental vehicle expenses incurred by the consumer as a result of the vehicle being out of service for warranty repair. A reasonable allowance for the consumer’s use of the vehicle shall be deducted from the refund to the consumer not to exceed the number of miles attributable to the consumer up to the date of the arbitration hearing multiplied by the purchase price of the vehicle and divided by one hundred twenty thousand (120,000). If the manufacturer offers a replacement vehicle under this section, the consumer has the option of rejecting the replacement vehicle and requiring the manufacturer to provide a refund. Refunds must be made to the consumer, and lienholder, if any, as their interests appear on the records of the division of motor vehicles of the Idaho transportation department. A manufacturer must give to the consumer an itemized statement listing each of the amounts refunded under this section. If the amount of sales or excise tax refunded is not separately stated, or if the manufacturer does not apply for a refund of the tax within one (1) year of the return of the motor vehicle, the state tax commission may refund the tax, as determined under subsection (8) of this section, directly to the consumer and lienholder, if any, as their interests appear on the records of the division of motor vehicles. It is an affirmative defense to any claim under this chapter: (a) that an alleged nonconformity does not impair the use or market value, or (b) that a nonconformity is the result of abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modifications or alterations of a motor vehicle by anyone other than the manufacturer, its agent or its authorized dealer.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-903ol12">
       It is presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a new motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties, if: (a) the same nonconformity has been subject to repair four (4) or more times by the manufacturer, its agents, or its authorized dealers within the applicable express warranty term or during the period of two (2) years following the date of original delivery of the new motor vehicle to a consumer or during the period ending with the date on which the mileage on the motor vehicle reaches twenty-four thousand (24,000) miles, whichever is the earliest date, but the nonconformity continues to exist. However, the manufacturer shall have at least one (1) opportunity to attempt to repair the vehicle before it is presumed a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranty; or (b) the vehicle is out of service by reason of repair for a cumulative total of thirty (30) or more business days during the term or during the period, whichever is the earlier date.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-903ol13">
       If the nonconformity results in a complete failure of the braking or steering system of the new motor vehicle and is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury if the vehicle is driven, it is presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranties if the nonconformity has been subject to repair at least once by the manufacturer, its agents, or its authorized dealers within the applicable express warranty term or during the period of two (2) years following the date of original delivery of the new motor vehicle to a consumer or during the period ending with the date on which the mileage on the motor vehicle reaches twenty-four thousand (24,000) miles, whichever is the earliest date, and the nonconformity continues to exist. However, the manufacturer shall have at least one (1) opportunity to attempt to repair the vehicle before it is presumed a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranty.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-903ol14">
       The term of an applicable express warranty, the two (2) year period and the thirty (30) day period shall be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of a war, invasion, strike, or fire, flood, or other natural disaster.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-903ol15">
       The presumption contained in subsection (2) of this section applies against a manufacturer only if the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer has received prior written notification from or on behalf of the consumer at least once and an opportunity to cure the defect alleged. If the notification is received by the manufacturer’s agent or authorized dealer, the agent or dealer must forward it to the manufacturer by certified mail, return receipt requested. However, if the manufacturer is not notified either by the consumer or the manufacturer’s agent or authorized dealer, then the manufacturer shall have at least one (1) opportunity to cure the alleged defect.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-903ol16">
       The expiration of the time periods set forth in subsection (2) of this section does not bar a consumer from receiving a refund or replacement vehicle under subsection (1) of this section if the reasonable number of attempts to correct the nonconformity causing the substantial impairment occur within three (3) years following the date of original delivery of the new motor vehicle to a consumer, provided the consumer first reported the nonconformity to the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer during the term of the applicable express warranty.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-903ol17">
       The manufacturer shall provide to its agent or authorized dealer and, at the time of purchase or lease, the manufacturer’s agent or authorized dealer shall provide a written statement to the consumer in the new motor vehicle warranty guide, in 10-point all capital type, in substantially the following form: “IMPORTANT: IF THIS VEHICLE IS DEFECTIVE, YOU MAY BE ENTITLED UNDER THE STATE’S LEMON LAW TO REPLACEMENT OF IT OR A REFUND OF ITS PURCHASE PRICE OR YOUR LEASE PAYMENTS. HOWEVER, TO BE ENTITLED TO REFUND OR REPLACEMENT, YOU MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE MANUFACTURER, ITS AGENT, OR ITS AUTHORIZED DEALER OF THE PROBLEM IN WRITING AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE. YOU ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO SUBMIT YOUR CASE TO THE CONSUMER ARBITRATION PROGRAM WHICH THE MANUFACTURER MUST OFFER IN THIS STATE.”
    (8) The amount of the sales or excise tax to be paid by the manufacturer to the consumer under subsection (1) of this section shall be the tax paid by the consumer when the vehicle was purchased less an amount equal to the tax paid multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the purchase price of the vehicle and the numerator of which is the allowance deducted from the refund for the consumer’s use of the vehicle.

     <p>
      A consumer who leases a new motor vehicle has the same rights against the manufacturer under this section as a consumer who purchases a new motor vehicle, except that, if it is determined that the manufacturer must accept return of the consumer’s leased vehicle pursuant to section 48-903, Idaho Code, then the consumer lessee is not entitled to a replacement vehicle, but is entitled only to a refund as provided in this section. In such a case, the consumer’s leased vehicle shall be returned to the manufacturer and the consumer’s written lease with the motor vehicle lessor must be terminated after all charges are settled. The manufacturer shall provide the consumer with a full refund of all costs and charges described below less a reasonable allowance for use. The manufacturer shall provide to the consumer a refund of the pro rata amount of any down payment paid by the consumer on the written lease. The pro rata amount of such a refund shall be the amount of the down payment divided by the number of months of the lease agreement and that amount multiplied by the number of months remaining after the date of the arbitration. The manufacturer shall also refund to the consumer amounts identified as additional charges set forth in section 48-903, Idaho Code, if actually paid by the consumer. The reasonable allowance for use shall be the lease payments made by the consumer until the time of the award of a refund. The manufacturer shall provide the motor vehicle lessor or its assignee with a full refund of the early termination charges plus the residual value of the vehicle, as specified in the lease agreement. The amount of any refund by the manufacturer to the consumer for the pro rata portion of the down payment plus the amount of the refund to the motor vehicle lessor or its assignee by the manufacturer shall not exceed one hundred five percent (105%) of the vehicle’s original manufacturer’s suggested retail price.

       Any manufacturer doing business in this state, entering into franchise agreements for the sale of its motor vehicles in this state, or offering express warranties on its motor vehicles sold or distributed for sale in this state shall operate, or participate in, an informal dispute settlement mechanism located in the state of Idaho which complies with the provisions of title 16, code of federal regulations, part 703, and the requirements of this section. The provisions of section 48-903, Idaho Code, concerning refunds or replacement do not apply to a consumer who has not first used this mechanism before commencing a civil action, unless the manufacturer allows a consumer to commence an action without first using this mechanism.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol12">
       An informal dispute settlement mechanism provided for by this chapter shall, at the time a request for arbitration is made, provide to the consumer and to each person who will arbitrate the consumer’s dispute, information about this chapter as approved and directed by the attorney general, in consultation with interested parties. The informal dispute settlement mechanism shall permit the parties to present or submit any arguments based on this chapter and shall not prohibit or discourage the consideration of any such arguments.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol13">
       If, in an informal dispute settlement mechanism, it is decided that a consumer is entitled to a replacement vehicle or refund under section 48-903, Idaho Code, then any refund or replacement offered by the manufacturer or selected by a consumer shall include and itemize all amounts authorized by section 48-903, Idaho Code. If the amount of excise tax refunded is not separately stated, or if the manufacturer does not apply for a refund of the tax within one (1) year of the return of the motor vehicle, the state tax commission may refund the sales tax, as determined under subsection (8) of section 48-903, Idaho Code, directly to the consumer and lienholder, if any, as their interests appear on the records of the division of motor vehicles of the Idaho transportation department.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol14">
       No documents shall be received by any informal dispute settlement mechanism unless those documents have been provided to each of the parties in the dispute at or prior to the mechanism’s meeting, with an opportunity for the parties to comment on the documents either in writing or orally. If a consumer is present during the informal dispute settlement mechanism’s meeting, the consumer may request postponement of the mechanism’s meeting to allow sufficient time to review any documents presented at the time of the meeting which had not been presented to the consumer prior to the meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol15">
       The informal dispute settlement mechanism shall allow each party to appear and make an oral presentation in the state of Idaho unless the consumer agrees to submit the dispute for decision on the basis of documents alone or by telephone, or unless the party fails to appear for an oral presentation after reasonable prior written notice. However, the manufacturer or its representative may participate in the informal dispute settlement mechanism’s meeting by telephone if it chooses. If the consumer agrees to submit the dispute for decision on the basis of documents alone, then manufacturer or dealer representatives may not participate in the discussion or decision of the dispute.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol16">
       Consumers shall be given an adequate opportunity to contest a manufacturer’s assertion that a nonconformity falls within intended specifications for the vehicle by having the basis of the manufacturer’s claim appraised by a technical expert selected and paid for by the consumer prior to the informal dispute settlement hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol17">
       Where there has been a recent attempt by the manufacturer to repair a consumer’s vehicle, but no response has yet been received by the informal dispute mechanism from the consumer as to whether the repairs were successfully completed, the parties must be given the opportunity to present any additional information regarding the manufacturer’s recent repair attempt before any final decision is rendered by the informal dispute settlement mechanism. This provision shall not prejudice a consumer’s rights under this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol18">
       If the manufacturer knows that a technical service bulletin directly applies to the specific mechanical problem being disputed by the consumer, then the manufacturer shall provide the technical service bulletin to the consumer at reasonable cost upon request. The mechanism shall review any such technical service bulletins submitted by either party.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol19">
       A consumer may be charged a fee to participate in an informal dispute settlement mechanism required by this chapter, but the fee may not exceed the conciliation court filing fee in the county where the arbitration is conducted.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol110">
       Any party to the dispute has the right to be represented by an attorney in an informal dispute settlement mechanism.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c09s48-906ol111">
       The informal dispute settlement mechanism has all the evidence-gathering powers granted an arbitrator under the uniform arbitration act.

     <p>
      The decision issued in an informal dispute settlement mechanism required by this chapter is nonbinding on the parties involved, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Any party, upon application, may remove the decision to district court for a trial de novo. If the manufacturer is aggrieved by the decision of the informal dispute settlement mechanism, an application to remove the decision must be filed in the district court within thirty (30) days after the date the decision is received by the parties. If the application to remove is not made within thirty (30) days, then the district court shall, upon application of a party, issue an order confirming the decision. A written decision issued by an informal dispute settlement mechanism, and any written findings upon which the decision is based, are admissible as nonbinding evidence in any subsequent legal action and are not subject to further foundation requirements.

       The use of telephones for commercial solicitation is rapidly increasing. This form of communication offers unique benefits, but also entails special risks and the potential for abuse. Many Idaho residents and businesses have lost money or suffered harm primarily as a result of out-of-state telemarketing abuse. For the general welfare of the public and in order to protect the integrity of the telemarketing industry, the following provisions of law are deemed necessary.

The provisions of this chapter are remedial, and shall be construed and applied liberally to accomplish the above-stated purposes.

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 1997, ch. 75 read: “The Legislature finds that with respect to pay-per-telephone call complaints received by state agencies, the overwhelming majority of them involve disputes over whether the consumer called or did not place a significant number of instances, the consumer being charged did not place the call in question. Nevertheless, these citizens have been subjected to various collection efforts, some unconscionable, which seek to coerce consumers into paying the charges regardless of their authenticity. These consumers are faced with the treat of lawsuits, notoriety, and embarrassment if they decline to pay. Therefore, this state’s policy shall be as stated in a new Section 48-1108, Idaho Code, which is that, unless excepted, charges for any adult entertainment pay-per-telephone call shall be void and unenforceable if the consumer has not first entered into a presubscription or comparable agreement, as defined in Section 48-1102, Idaho Code, to purchase the adult entertainment pay-per-telephone call. Also, any effort by the provider of the adult entertainment pay-per-telephone call to collect the charges absent an agreement shall be considered a false and deceptive practice in violation of the Idaho Consumer Protection Act.”

       The use of pay-per-telephone call services for commercial solicitation is rapidly increasing. This form of communication offers unique benefits, but also entails special risks and the potential for abuse. Many consumers of goods and services have suffered serious losses because of misrepresentations and failures to disclose material facts. For the general welfare of the public and in order to protect the integrity of the pay-per-telephone call service industry, the following provisions of law are deemed necessary.

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 1997, ch. 75 read: “The Legislature finds that with respect to pay-per-telephone call complaints received by state agencies, the overwhelming majority of them involve disputes over whether the consumer called or did not place an adult entertainment pay-per-telephone call. The legislature finds that, in a significant number of instances, the consumer being charged did not place the call in question. Nevertheless, these citizens have been subjected to various collection efforts, some unconscionable, which seek to coerce consumers into paying the charges regardless of their authenticity. These consumers are faced with the threat of lawsuits, notoriety, and embarrassment if they decline to pay. Therefore, this state’s policy shall be as stated in a new Section 48-1108, Idaho Code, which is that, unless excepted, charges for any adult entertainment pay-per-telephone call shall be void and unenforceable if the consumer has not first entered into a presubscription or comparable agreement, as defined in Section 48-1102, Idaho Code, to purchase the adult entertainment pay-per-telephone call. Also, any effort by the provider of the adult entertainment pay-per-telephone call to collect the charges absent an agreement shall be considered a false and deceptive practice in violation of the Idaho Consumer Protection Act.”

The attorney general may grant such permission if the attorney general is satisfied that the modified message will adequately disclose sufficient material facts which will safeguard the public against deceit and financial hardship. Such decision shall be final and nonappealable.

      <li id="t48c17s48-1701ol11">
       The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t48c17s48-1701ol11a">
         Idaho is striving to build an entrepreneurial and knowledge-based economy. Attracting and nurturing information technology (IT) and other knowledge-based companies are important parts of this effort and will be beneficial to Idaho’s future.
        </li>
        <li id="t48c17s48-1701ol11b">
         Patents are essential to encouraging innovation, especially in the IT and knowledge-based fields. The protections afforded by the federal patent system create an incentive to invest in research and innovation, which spurs economic growth. Patent holders have every right to enforce their patents when they are valid and infringed, to solicit interest from prospective licensees and to initiate patent enforcement litigation as necessary to protect intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li id="t48c17s48-1701ol11c">
         The legislature does not wish to interfere with the good faith enforcement of patents or good faith patent litigation. The legislature also recognizes that Idaho is preempted from passing any law that conflicts with federal patent law.
        </li>
        <li id="t48c17s48-1701ol11d">
         Abusive patent litigation, and especially the assertion of bad faith infringement claims, can harm Idaho companies. A business that receives a letter or other communication asserting such claims faces the threat of expensive and protracted litigation and may feel that it has no choice but to settle and to pay a licensing fee, even if the claim is meritless.
        </li>
        <li id="t48c17s48-1701ol11e">
         Not only do bad faith patent infringement claims impose a significant burden on individual Idaho businesses, they also undermine Idaho’s efforts to attract and nurture IT and other knowledge-based companies. Funds used to avoid the threat of bad faith litigation are no longer available to invest, produce new products, expand or hire new workers, thereby harming Idaho’s economy.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t48c17s48-1701ol12">
       Through this narrowly focused chapter, the legislature seeks to facilitate the efficient and prompt resolution of patent infringement claims, protect Idaho businesses from abusive and bad faith assertions of patent infringement and build Idaho’s economy, while at the same time carefully not interfering with legitimate patent enforcement actions.

      <li id="t48c19s48-1902ol11">
       The state of Idaho is home to thousands of charitable organizations that, collectively, hold billions of dollars in charitable assets. Charitable organizations have a legal duty to use their charitable assets according to the charitable purposes designated in their governing documents. The legislature is aware, however, that misuse or misappropriation of charitable assets occurs to the harm of the charitable purposes for which they were donated and the communities that were intended to be benefitted by the charitable donation.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c19s48-1902ol12">
       The attorney general, as the state of Idaho’s chief legal officer, has a legal duty to ensure that charitable assets are used for their intended purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c19s48-1902ol13">
       The current law governing the attorney general’s authority over charitable organizations holding charitable assets does not adequately define the attorney general’s duties and enforcement authorities. Further, Idaho law has not effectively defined the attorney general’s authority to address a person’s unlawful misuse or misappropriation of charitable assets.
      </li>
      <li id="t48c19s48-1902ol14">
       Therefore, through this chapter, it is the legislature’s intent to:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t48c19s48-1902ol14a">
         Define the attorney general’s duties to protect charitable assets from misuse or misappropriation and to provide the attorney general with the necessary authority and enforcement tools to protect charitable assets; and
        </li>
        <li id="t48c19s48-1902ol14b">
         Provide a procedure for notifying the attorney general before certain charitable organizations dissolve, convert to a noncharitable organization, terminate, or otherwise dispose of their charitable assets.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t48c19s48-1902ol15">
       The provisions of this chapter are remedial and shall be construed and applied liberally to accomplish the purposes provided for in this section and to protect Idaho charitable assets.
