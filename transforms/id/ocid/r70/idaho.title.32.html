        Common-law Marriage.

       <p>
        Where the husband entered into a consent marriage at a time when his first wife was living, the continuance of the second marital relation and assumption of its duties after decree of divorce from his first wife became final amounted to a “consensual marriage” which could be avoided only by death or divorce. Morrison v. Sunshine Mining Co., 64 Idaho 6, 127 P.2d 766 (1942) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        No common-law marriage existed prior to marriage ceremony, where wife never asserted that she was married to husband prior to marriage, and the parties’ cohabitation between 1980 and 1986 was erratic. McCoy v. McCoy, 125 Idaho 199, 868 P.2d 527 (Ct. App. 1994) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        A common-law marriage arises where the consent of the parties capable of making it is followed by a mutual assumption of marital rights, duties or obligations. Hamby v. J.R. Simplot Co., 94 Idaho 794, 498 P.2d 1267 (1972) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the testimony indicated that the parties lived together, assumed marital rights and duties, including the conception and birth of a son, and that they held themselves out as husband and wife, beginning in June, 1967, the trial court’s finding that the marriage relationship began in June, 1970 on the date of the ceremonial marriage was not supported by substantial evidence. Eliasen v. Fitzgerald, 105 Idaho 234, 668 P.2d 110 (1983) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>

        Because parties intentionally chose not to obtain a marriage license, their purported marriage violated subsection (1) and summary judgment was properly awarded to defendant in plaintiff’s action for divorce. Dire v. Dire-Blodgett, 140 Idaho 777, 102 P.3d 1096 (2004).

        District court properly refused to adopt the parties’ post-trial stipulation to apply divorce law to a petition for an equitable division and distribution of property where the Idaho legislature had abolished common-law marriage for the stated purpose of promoting the stability and best interests of marriage and the family, thereby commanding the court to refrain from enforcing contracts in contravention of clearly declared public policy and from legally recognizing co-habitational relationships in general.

        Where a husband entered into consent marriage at a time when the first wife was still living, and continued in such second marital relation, and he and the second wife conducted themselves as husband and wife after the divorce decree from the first wife had become final, and in application for employment, the husband named the second wife as his wife, such second wife was the husband’s “widow” on his death, and entitled to workmen’s compensation. Morrison v. Sunshine Mining Co., 64 Idaho 6, 127 P.2d 766 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant did not fail to establish her status as employee’s “widow” entitled to workmen’s compensation because consensual marriage was consummated in Montana without recording joint declaration of marriage as required by Montana directory statutes. Morrison v. Sunshine Mining Co., 64 Idaho 6, 127 P.2d 766 (1942).
    Where appellant never held herself out as a married woman, received public assistance for herself and child, had the electric power billed to herself, obtained credit by executing a promissory note and mortgage in her own name, she did not establish that she was the surviving common-law wife of the decedent and was not entitled to letters of administration.

       <p>
        Even though a marriage was first consented to and consummated by Idaho parties while in Washington, a marriage was shown to be also consented to and consummated in Idaho where the parties freely acknowledged the relationship in Idaho upon their return from Washington. Foster v. Diehl Lumber Co., 77 Idaho 26, 287 P.2d 282 (1955) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).

        Consent required by this section must be given when the parties enter into the contractual responsibilities of marriage. In re Estate of Gholson, 83 Idaho 270, 361 P.2d 791 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        A requirement of a specific formal marriage contract would be contrary to allowing consent to be implied from the parties’ act and conduct; thus, evidence of conduct by and between the parties consistent with the existence of a common-law marriage may be probative of consent. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consent to enter into a common-law relationship may be implied and established from the circumstances and facts of the parties’ relationship in cohabiting, assuming the rights, duties and obligations of marriage, and holding out of themselves as husband and wife. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where persons having the capacity to contract have held themselves out to be husband and wife, and have gained that general reputation in the community, or where they acknowledge that they are husband and wife, a court may be warranted in drawing the inference that at the outset there was then present mutual consent between the parties to assume a marital relationship. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although not separately designated elements of the doctrine under the statutory framework, proof of cohabitation of the parties and holding oneself out as being married are two of the best methods for proving that there was consent to the contract in the absence of a writing to that effect and the element of consent found in this section and needed to establish common law marriage may be proven by circumstantial evidence such as cohabitation, reputation, and the manner in which the couple characterize their relationship. Hall v. Becker, 126 Idaho 848, 893 P.2d 211 (1995).

        Plaintiff, who entered into ceremonial marriages on two occasions with defendant, and who later returned to defendant and lived with defendant in common-law relationship following unsuccessful marriages with two other persons was entitled to a divorce from common-law marriage with defendant where there was no evidence that third husband had died or had secured a divorce from the plaintiff, as the defendant was estopped by virtue of his acts and conduct from declaring that plaintiff’s marriage with a third husband was a bar to the common-law marriage of plaintiff and defendant.

        In contrast with other jurisdictions, Idaho has never viewed the doctrine of common-law marriage with disfavor. Together with a small number of other states, Idaho permits a non-ceremonial marriage to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.

        Presumption Concerning Marriage.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Though there was a legal impediment to prevent a valid marriage, as where there was a former husband or wife living at the time, still a valid marriage will be presumed to have occurred after removal of such impediment by death or divorce, where parties continue their marital duties, rights and obligations. Huff v. Huff, 20 Idaho 450, 118 P. 1080 (1911) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of a marriage, regular or irregular, raises a strong presumption of its legality, casting the burden on the party attacking it to show that it is illegal or void. Mauldin v. Sunshine Mining Co., 61 Idaho 9, 97 P.2d 608 (1939) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Presumption of marriage from cohabitation, apparently matrimonial, is one of the strongest presumptions known to the law. Mauldin v. Sunshine Mining Co., 61 Idaho 9, 97 P.2d 608 (1939) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the original cohabitation was preceded by a ceremonial marriage which was void because one of the parties was already married, the continuance of the cohabitation after the removal of the impediment by death of the former husband or wife, in connection with circumstances tending to show that the parties regarded their relations as of a matrimonial character, and held themselves out as husband and wife, creates a presumption of marriage, although there is no evidence of another ceremony. Nicholas v. Idaho Power Co., 63 Idaho 675, 125 P.2d 321 (1942) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        All reasonable presumptions must be indulged in in favor of the regularity and legality of marriage regularly solemnized and the burden of removing such presumption is cast upon the party attacking the validity of the marriage to show by clear, cogent and satisfactory evidence that a legal impediment to such marriage existed at the time of the solemnization thereof. Lea v. Galbraith, 64 Idaho 724, 137 P.2d 320 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a marriage has been shown in evidence, whether regular or irregular, and whatever the form of proof, the law raises a strong presumption of its legality, casting the burden of proof upon the party objecting and requiring him in every particular to make plain, against the constant pressure of this presumption, the truth of law and fact that the marriage is illegal and void. Thomey v. Thomey, 67 Idaho 393, 181 P.2d 777 (1947) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
    The rule adopted in this jurisdiction is that the law presumes morality, and not immorality; marriage, and not concubinage; legitimacy, and not bastardy — every intendment of the law leans toward matrimony. Thomey v. Thomey, 67 Idaho 393, 181 P.2d 777 (1947) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).

        Proof of marriage by the testimony of one of the parties is sufficient, as the presumption in favor of validity of marriage must be overcome by clear and positive evidence. Mauldin v. Sunshine Mining Co., 61 Idaho 9, 97 P.2d 608 (1939) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statement by deceased to bookkeeper of his employer relative to taking of deductions that he was not married was overcome by his representation in writing to motel keeper that he and claimant were married, and by his introduction of claimant as his wife in public.

       </p>
       <p>
        Finding by workers’ compensation board that the relationship of the deceased and the claimant was “a marriage per verba de futuro cum copula” was not correct where the record showed that the deceased and the claimant were persons of high moral character who openly and publicly acknowledged that they were husband and wife, and showed a marriage by mutual assumption of marital rights, duties and obligations in full compliance with this section. Foster v. Diehl Lumber Co., 77 Idaho 26, 287 P.2d 282 (1955) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).

        Finding of district court that petitioner, alleged common-law wife of deceased had not established a prima facie marriage by consent and consummation, would not be overruled by Supreme Court, where there was competent evidence that petitioner and deceased had only been friends, and their cohabiting furtive.

       </p>

        The existence of a common-law marriage may be established by evidence that the parties have acquired a uniform and general reputation as husband and wife and may be negated by evidence that the parties held themselves out as single persons. Hamby v. J.R. Simplot Co., 94 Idaho 794, 498 P.2d 1267 (1972) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whereas in most instances, questions as to the existence of a common-law marriage will arise only after death, such a marriage may be proven by the testimony of one of the parties. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it was established that a man and a woman were persons without impediment, who consented to and consummated a marriage by cohabitation and mutual assumption of marital rights, duties or obligations in compliance with this section, a strong presumption of marriage was created which cast the burden of proof upon the contestants to rebut such presumption by clear and positive evidence. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
    Where, in an action between deceased’s common-law wife and his children by his first marriage to determine the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, the continued use by the wife of her former surname for the purpose of continuing to receive her civil service widow pension following the death of her first husband did not negate her consent to enter the subsequent common-law marriage nor render that marriage void. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        To make a prima facie showing of a marriage, the alleged wife’s evidence must have established not only consent, but also mutual assumption of the rights, duties and responsibilities of marriage, by cohabitation and by holding themselves out to the community as husband and wife; only then would the alleged common-law husband have to overcome the presumption of a marriage by providing “clear and positive proof” to the contrary. Freiburghaus v. Freiburghaus, 103 Idaho 679, 651 P.2d 944 (Ct. App. 1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff seeking divorce from alleged common-law marriage did not show a solemnization of such marriage, and where the parties did not reside together or hold themselves out publicly as being married, the trial judge erred in determining that a marriage existed. Freiburghaus v. Freiburghaus, 103 Idaho 679, 651 P.2d 944 (Ct. App. 1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a common-law marriage may be proven by testimony of a party to that relationship, the existence of such a common-law relationship may be negated by evidence that the parties held themselves out as single persons rather than as husband and wife.

        Same-Sex Marriages.

       <p>
        Without a marriage amendment to the Idaho Constitution, a couple who seeks to solemnize their relationship in Idaho could bring a lawsuit alleging that Idaho’s marriage statutes violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the Idaho Constitution. A couple that seeks recognition in Idaho of a relationship solemnized in another state could further claim that full faith and credit is due the relationship under the United States Constitution. Although the Idaho Supreme Court would probably reject these challenges under current law, a marriage amendment would bar a challenge under the Idaho Constitution and would strengthen Idaho’s current statement of public policy rejecting same-sex marriages formed in other states.<cite class="OAG">OAG 06-1</cite>.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any unmarried male of the age of eighteen (18) years or older, and any unmarried female of the age of eighteen (18) years or older, and not otherwise disqualified, are capable of consenting to and consummating marriage. A minor under eighteen (18) and not less than sixteen (16) years of age may not contract marriage with a person of the age of majority where there is an age difference of three (3) years or greater between them. No marriage license for a minor under the age of eighteen (18) and not less than sixteen (16) years of age shall be issued where there is such an age difference between the parties. Provided that if the male party to the contract is under the age of eighteen (18) and not less than sixteen (16) years of age, or if the female party to the contract is under the age of eighteen (18) and not less than sixteen (16) years of age, the license shall not be issued except upon the consent in writing duly acknowledged and sworn to by the father, mother, or guardian of any such person if there be either, and provided further, that no such license may be issued, if the male be under eighteen (18) and not less than sixteen (16) years of age and the female under eighteen (18) and not less than sixteen (16) years of age, unless each party to the contract submits to the county recorder his or her original birth certificate, or certified copy thereof or other proof of age acceptable to the county recorder. Where the female is under the age of sixteen (16), or the male is under the age of sixteen (16), the license shall not be issued.

        Idaho’s laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples and prohibiting the recognition of same-sex marriages do not survive any applicable level of constitutional scrutiny and, therefore, violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const., Amend.

        Without a marriage amendment to the Idaho Constitution, a couple who seeks to solemnize their relationship in Idaho could bring a lawsuit alleging that Idaho’s marriage statutes violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the Idaho Constitution. A couple that seeks recognition in Idaho of a relationship solemnized in another state could further claim that full faith and credit is due the relationship under the United States Constitution. Although the Idaho supreme court would probably reject these challenges under current law, a marriage amendment would bar a challenge under the Idaho Constitution and would strengthen Idaho’s current statement of public policy rejecting same-sex marriages formed in other states.<cite class="OAG">OAG 06-1</cite>.

        Where, after death of former spouse, a couple recognize their union as husband and wife and enter upon the marriage relation and children are born to them thereafter, such relationship develops into a common-law marriage. Huff v. Huff, 20 Idaho 450, 118 P. 1080 (1911) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        In contrast with other jurisdictions, Idaho has never viewed the doctrine of common-law marriage with disfavor. Together with a small number of other states, Idaho permits a non-ceremonial marriage to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).

        A desire for a ceremonial marriage does not necessarily preclude the existence of a common-law marriage. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Idaho 122, 645 P.2d 356 (1982) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).
    Where the testimony indicated that the parties lived together, assumed marital rights and duties, including the conception and birth of a son, and that they held themselves out as husband and wife, beginning in June, 1967, the trial court’s finding that the marriage relationship began in June, 1970 on the date of the ceremonial marriage was not supported by substantial evidence.

     <p>
      When a marriage is annulled for any reason, other than for fraud in that the wife is pregnant with the child of a man other than the husband, children begotten before judgment are legitimate and succeed to the state [estate] of both parents. The court may at the time of granting the annulment or at any future time, make necessary orders for the support of said child or children as the circumstances and surroundings of the parents may require.

        In an action by a wife, six years after her divorce, for a redetermination of community property interest in husband’s pension benefits, in which wife was awarded one-half of the pension benefits, valued at the time of actual retirement, that award included increases in pension benefits which accrued after the date of divorce, and hence not acquired during marriage, but during the time the husband was an unmarried person. As such, those increases constituted the separate property of the husband, and, to the extent that an interest in those post-divorce increases was awarded to the wife, it constituted an impermissible invasion of husband’s separate property.

        A marriage continues, despite a separation, until a decree of divorce. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).

       <p>
        In Idaho, the characterization of an asset as community or separate property depends on the date and source of the property’s acquisition. Where divorce proceedings were pending at the time of a husband’s death but a final divorce decree had not been entered, the marital community continued to exist until the husband’s death, and community property principles applied. Banner Life Ins. Co. v. Mark Wallace Dixson Irrevocable Trust, 147 Idaho 117, 206 P.3d 481 (2009).

        The magistrate determined the valuation date to be the date of the order granting a partial divorce decree, and, since community property only exists as long as the community exists, once the magistrate issued the divorce and certified it as final, it necessarily follows that the date of valuation should occur on that date.

        In an action by a wife, six years after her divorce, for a redetermination of community property interest in husband’s pension benefits, in which wife was awarded one-half of the pension benefits, valued at the time of actual retirement, that award included increases in pension benefits which accrued after the date of divorce, and hence not acquired during marriage, but during the time the husband was an unmarried person. As such, those increases constituted the separate property of the husband, and, to the extent that an interest in those post-divorce increases was awarded to the wife, it constituted an impermissible invasion of husband’s separate property.

       <p>
        Even if the evidence in a divorce suit had been sufficient to support the wife’s allegations of cruelty, the judgment granting a divorce to the husband on grounds of cruelty and denying the wife’s counterclaim was not reversibly erroneous where the wife wanted the bonds of matrimony dissolved, either by annulment or divorce, and did not interpose her ground for divorce as a recriminatory defense; in the absence of a showing that she was prejudiced the judgment would not be reversed merely because the evidence might support a decree of divorce to both parties.

        Extreme cruelty is a term of relative meaning and a course of conduct that would inflict mental suffering upon one person might not have that effect upon another. Angleton v. Angleton, 84 Idaho 184, 370 P.2d 788 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s finding of extreme cruelty on part of wife was sustained by evidence that she was incapable or unwilling to give her husband the love he desired but devoted her attention to other men, indulging in scandalous conduct. Lawson v. Lawson, 87 Idaho 444, 394 P.2d 1008 (1964).

        Where cruelty is alleged to have consisted in the wife’s hostile demonstrations and lecturing, nagging, and hectoring husband and evidence discloses that he has been so indiscreet in his conduct toward others as to arouse suspicion on part of his wife, conduct of the wife in her protests and outbursts of feeling will not be viewed with the same severity and rigidity by law as it would be in case where no such apparent provocation existed.

        When conduct is alleged to constitute extreme cruelty within this section, it (the conduct) is not to be considered in the abstract; the crucial determination is how the conduct has affected a spouse. Parks v. Parks, 91 Idaho 420, 422 P.2d 618 (1967).

        While the memorandum decision did not specifically state that the acts of the wife affected the mental or physical health of husband, the reasonable inference to be drawn from the language used was that her conduct caused respondent substantial mental suffering, thus supporting the necessary allegation of extreme cruelty.

        Where wife did not “discover” husband’s affair until 1989 and never discovered many of husband’s other acts of adultery, there was substantial and competent evidence that the divorce based on adultery was not barred by the statute of limitations.

        In suit by former resident of Canada for divorce based on five years separation, a cross complaint by defendant wife, a resident of Michigan, based on desertion, neglect, and cruelty occurring more than ten years prior thereto was barred by this section, since it would be assumed that the law of Michigan was the same as the law of Idaho where no evidence was introduced as to law of Michigan.

        Jurisdiction.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In actions for divorce, determination of whether plaintiff has been a resident of the state for the required time is not a question of jurisdiction, but with determination of “domicil” it is otherwise, for jurisdiction of the res depends on “domicil.” Robinson v. Robinson, 70 Idaho 122, 212 P.2d 1031 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not diminish the broad jurisdiction of courts in divorce actions created by the Constitution, it merely prescribes a condition or qualification which the plaintiff must meet to entitle him to a divorce. Robinson v. Robinson, 70 Idaho 122, 212 P.2d 1031 (1949).

       </p>
       <p>
        To effect a change of domicil, there must be a removal and an intent, and the fact that the removal is accomplished because of the performance of a duty by reason of being in the service of the United States is immaterial, where the intent is established.

        If evidence on good faith of plaintiff’s domicil is conflicting, the determination of the court upon the issue based on substantial and competent evidence is conclusive. Jolliffe v. Jolliffe, 76 Idaho 95, 278 P.2d 200 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife, a former resident of California, was entitled to a divorce in Idaho where evidence by herself and two corroborating witnesses showed that she intended to abandon residence in California and establish a new residence in Idaho. Newell v. Newell, 77 Idaho 355, 293 P.2d 663, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 871, 77 S. Ct. 95, 1 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        A reasonable inference to be drawn from the court’s finding that plaintiff should be granted a divorce was that plaintiff’s residence within this state was of such nature and duration as was necessary to meet the statutory requirements, otherwise the court would not have found that plaintiff was entitled to a divorce. Angleton v. Angleton, 84 Idaho 184, 370 P.2d 788 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence was submitted by wife that husband had left property in the state of Nebraska where he had been a lifelong resident, that he had no relatives in Idaho and was not a registered voter in Idaho and where husband testified that he did not come to Idaho for the purpose of obtaining a divorce but rather for the purpose of living in Idaho where he was seeking employment and an escape from the circumstances of his life in Nebraska, finding that husband was a resident of and domiciled in Idaho would not be set aside, such issue of fact of residence being for the trial judge’s consideration. Milbourn v. Milbourn, 86 Idaho 213, 384 P.2d 476 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court having determined the issue of husband’s Idaho residence at the time of divorce upon substantial and competent though conflicting evidence, its findings will not be set aside by the supreme court. Milbourn v. Milbourn, 86 Idaho 213, 384 P.2d 476 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where all the pleadings of the parties alleged the residence of both parties in Idaho for more than six months prior to the commencement of the action in 1965 and defendant testified that “right after the marriage” in 1960 they established their residence in Idaho, the defendant’s residence was sufficiently shown. Johnson v. Johnson, 92 Idaho 365, 442 P.2d 775 (1969).

        Where record indicated the plaintiff arrived in state of Idaho on September 29, and informed his wife in December of that year that he “was not coming home,” based on this evidence, trial court found that the plaintiff actually resided within the state of Idaho for at least six weeks pursuant to the statute and therefore trial court had jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings instituted by the plaintiff after the completion of the six week period.

        Award of Costs and Attorney’s Fees.
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is nothing in this section that confines attorney’s fee to future and not to past services. Taylor v. Taylor, 33 Idaho 445, 196 P. 211 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        While action for divorce could not be resumed after condonation, it could be continued for purpose of compelling husband to pay wife’s attorney’s fees. Taylor v. Taylor, 33 Idaho 445, 196 P. 211 (1921); Ex parte Cole v. Cole, 68 Idaho 257, 193 P.2d 395 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where decree did not require husband to pay fees of wife’s attorney, the court could not fix fees of attorneys in the proceeding, or place a lien for such fees on real estate in which wife had an interest. Heslip v. Heslip, 74 Idaho 368, 262 P.2d 999 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error for the trial court to disallow attorney fees and costs to defendant wife in divorce action where neither party had ample funds with which to prosecute the appeal. Lovell v. Lovell, 80 Idaho 251, 328 P.2d 71 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the husband was granted divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty, trial court erred in denying allowance of attorney fees to wife, since this statute contemplates the husband must, if possible, help her bear the expense. Riggers v. Riggers, 81 Idaho 570, 347 P.2d 762 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The allowance of attorney fees is discretionary with the trial court, and an award of $100 in addition to $150 paid before the trial was not unreasonable. Voss v. Voss, 91 Idaho 17, 415 P.2d 303 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to award the plaintiff-wife more than $1,000 above the minimum attorney’s fee suggested by the state bar association advisory fee schedule for a contested divorce was not an abuse of discretion. Hammond v. Hammond, 92 Idaho 623, 448 P.2d 237 (1968).
    The court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to the wife even though the husband was the prevailing party. Lepel v. Lepel, 93 Idaho 82, 456 P.2d 249 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees must be allowed at the discretion of the trial court whenever one parent to a child custody case, whether husband or wife, is found to be unable to proceed without payment of attorney’s fees, and where the other parent is able to pay that amount, notwithstanding the outcome of the appeal. Poesy v. Bunney, 98 Idaho 258, 561 P.2d 400 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where wife had assets valued at approximately $68,000, the trial court’s determination that she had sufficient assets to pay her attorney fees could not be characterized as an abuse of discretion. Martsch v. Martsch, 103 Idaho 142, 645 P.2d 882 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The award of attorney fees under this section is discretionary with the trial court; where a party has sufficient assets to pay attorney fees, it is not an abuse of discretion to deny a request for a fee award. Sherry v. Sherry, 108 Idaho 645, 701 P.2d 265 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section authorizes the trial court to award attorney fees in an action to modify a divorce decree, where the financial resources of the parties so dictate; such an award is not appropriate where a party has the financial resources necessary to prosecute or defend the action. Golder v. Golder, 110 Idaho 57, 714 P.2d 26 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the wife was awarded an additional $166,000 as her share of the parties’ community property, it cannot be said that she was without sufficient funds to pay her attorney fees. Golder v. Golder, 110 Idaho 57, 714 P.2d 26 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in a divorce action, the husband presented neither a genuine legal issue nor a cogent challenge to the judge’s exercise of discretion, the wife was awarded attorney fees under this section. McPherson v. McPherson, 112 Idaho 402, 732 P.2d 371 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to the wife and requiring the husband to pay those attorney fees as part of the community debt. Shurtliff v. Shurtliff, 112 Idaho 1031, 739 P.2d 330 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The award of attorney fees in divorce actions and marital property divisions has long been the province of the trial court, and the court is bound by the standard pronounced in this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-705" target="_self">§ 32-705</a></cite>. Beesley v. Beesley, 114 Idaho 536, 758 P.2d 695 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The magistrate acted within his discretion in awarding attorney fees to wife. Desfosses v. Desfosses, 120 Idaho 354, 815 P.2d 1094 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a court to award attorney fees, it must consider the financial resources of the parties and the factors in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-705" target="_self">§ 32-705</a></cite>. Bell v. Bell, 122 Idaho 520, 835 P.2d 1331 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither party was entitled to attorney fees pursuant to subsection 3, because there was nothing in the record that indicated that either party presented a request for such an award under the statute to the magistrate or district court judge, nor did they provide any information to the court to support the request. Gustaves v. Gustaves, 138 Idaho 64, 57 P.3d 775 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees, as the husband earned approximately 84 percent of the parties’ combined income and also owned investment and income-producing property; although the wife was awarded assets of a significant value in the divorce, many of the assets, such as the house and other real property, were not liquid. Stephens v. Stephens, 138 Idaho 195, 61 P.3d 63 (Ct. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the magistrate did not abuse his discretion when he denied the wife’s request for attorney fees and costs, because the same evidence that supported the denial of maintenance, showing that the wife could meet her monthly expenses, also supported a denial of her request for attorney fees and costs. Hoskinson v. Hoskinson, 139 Idaho 448, 80 P.3d 1049 (2003).
    In a property division action as part of a divorce, a former wife was not entitled to attorney’s fees, because the previously unsettled state of the law on the characterization of professional goodwill made an award of attorneys fees inappropriate, and because the wife made no showing of necessity to the court. Stewart v. Stewart, 143 Idaho 673, 152 P.3d 544 (2007).

        Award of expert witness costs was based upon ex-wife’s prevailing in action for equitable restitution, not on financial need, and therefore was not in nature of support under Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5) and was therefore dischargeable. Hainline v. Neal, 179 Bankr. 234 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees, if awarded on remand, would be in the nature of support and therefore an exception to discharge under Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5). Hainline v. Neal, 179 Bankr. 234 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1995).

        — Financial Need.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (2) is not the exclusive avenue available to a party seeking attorney fees in a divorce action. A court may award fees based on financial need under this section; however,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121 </a></cite>applies to all civil actions. Hentges v. Hentges, 115 Idaho 192, 765 P.2d 1094 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where magistrate’s decision indicated that he had reviewed the factors set forth in this section and in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-705" target="_self">§ 32-705</a></cite>, and found that each party had sufficient property and employment to provide for his or her reasonable needs, he did not abuse his discretion in denying attorney fees to mother pursuant to this section. Jensen v. Jensen, 128 Idaho 600, 917 P.2d 757 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mother stipulated in reply brief that the court could rely on the financial record before the magistrate in determining whether mother was entitled to attorney fees on appeal, magistrate’s finding that each party had sufficient property and employment to provide for their reasonable needs precluded award. Jensen v. Jensen, 128 Idaho 600, 917 P.2d 757 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The magistrate did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees pursuant to subsection (3) where the magistrate found that a substantial disparity existed between the incomes of the parties, that the wife was incapable of paying her own attorney fees, and that the husband could afford to pay those fees for her, and these findings were supported by substantial and competent evidence contained in the record. Perez v. Perez, 134 Idaho 555, 6 P.3d 411 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disparity in income is sufficient to support a magistrate’s conclusion that the party with the higher income should pay a share of the other party’s attorney fees under this section. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).

       <p>
        Where the trial court found that wife was able to support herself through employment and she was underemployed and where husband did not have the ability to pay wife’s attorney fees because he was supporting another family and would be paying increased child support, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to award attorney fees to wife. Ireland v. Ireland, 123 Idaho 955, 855 P.2d 40 (1993), overruled on other grounds, Zenner v. Holcomb, 147 Idaho 444, 210 P.3d 552 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record and arguments made in a divorce action did not lead to a conclusion that the action was brought, pursued, or defended frivolously, nor was unreasonable or without foundation, attorney’s fees were inappropriate. Tisdale v. Tisdale, 127 Idaho 331, 900 P.2d 807 (Ct. App. 1995).
    In a proceeding to modify a divorce decree, where it was determined that the defenses of the party objecting to the proposed modification were not pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation and where the magistrate’s decision did not apply the factors set forth in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-705" target="_self">§ 32-705</a></cite>, the magistrate’s decision to award attorney fees was in error and could not be upheld. Rohr v. Rohr, 128 Idaho 137, 911 P.2d 133 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant did not seek an order from the judge requiring plaintiff to pay her attorney’s fees on appeal in divorce action, fees would not be awarded unless it was necessary to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction and as defendant had been able to defend appeal thus far, an award of attorney’s fees was not necessary and denied under this section. Wilson v. Wilson, 131 Idaho 533, 960 P.2d 1262 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a plaintiff did not seek an order from the district judge requiring the defendant to pay her attorney fees on appeal, and where such an award was not necessary to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction because the plaintiff had been able to defend the appeal, attorney fees were not awarded. Thomas v. Worthington, 132 Idaho 825, 979 P.2d 1183 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a mother acted in violation of a magistrate’s order regarding the relocation of two minor children, awarding fees under this section was inappropriate. Roberts v. Roberts, 138 Idaho 401, 64 P.3d 327 (2003).

       <p>
        Where, in a divorce suit, it appeared that defendant was a wealthy man, and his wife was without means to properly prosecute her suit for divorce, court would allow her attorney’s fees on an appeal from order refusing to change place of trial. Day v. Day, 12 Idaho 556, 86 P. 531 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Order requiring husband to pay wife fees to combat husband’s appeal from order allowing wife counsel fees was not improper as being collateral to main action. Largilliere v. Largilliere, 50 Idaho 496, 298 P. 362 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Being without funds or property does not absolve husband from duty to provide wife with funds necessary to pay costs and attorney’s fees on appeal. Bedke v. Bedke, 56 Idaho 235, 53 P.2d 1175 (1935) (Decision prior to 1980 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is an uncertainty as to the financial ability of either party to pay attorneys’ fees and costs of printing brief on appeal and uncertainty as to disposition of the case, a motion by respondent for attorneys’ fees and costs will not be considered and determined until disposition of the appeal. McHan v. McHan, 59 Idaho 41, 80 P.2d 29 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        A husband was required, under this section, to pay attorney’s fees and costs of appeal of the wife from the order granting the husband’s motion for a change of venue of a divorce action to the county of the husband’s residence, notwithstanding the order was affirmed. Finnell v. Finnell, 59 Idaho 148, 81 P.2d 401 (1938) (Decision prior to 1980 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section contemplates that the husband must, if financially able, at least help to bear the expense of appeal. Finnell v. Finnell, 59 Idaho 148, 81 P.2d 401 (1938) (Decision prior to 1980 amendment).
    Where district court had made order against husband to provide funds for payment of costs and expenditure of wife’s appeal, supreme court would not enforce order where wife had borrowed funds to perfect appeal, since district court was able to enforce its own orders. Brashear v. Brashear, 71 Idaho 158, 228 P.2d 243 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court may, under prescribed conditions, allow attorney fees and costs on appeal from the trial court’s decision in divorce case. Wenzel v. Wenzel, 76 Idaho 7, 276 P.2d 485 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where wife was without funds and was in poor health, and husband was in control of community funds and was earning $750 a month in wages, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring husband to pay $500 to wife’s counsel for conduct of appeal proceeding. Gapsch v. Gapsch, 76 Idaho 44, 277 P.2d 278 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a divorce action was still pending because of the pending question of child custody, an allowance by the trial court of $50 for the wife’s attorney’s fee on appeal did not constitute a limitation upon the amount to be allowed therefor, since the mother of the children had a right to be represented, the matter of fixing the balance of attorney’s fee in addition to the sum of $50 allowed resting in the discretion of the trial court. Merrill v. Merrill, 83 Idaho 306, 362 P.2d 887 (1961).
       </p>

        Where an appeal in a divorce case is brought frivolously and without foundation, an appellate court may award fees under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121</a></cite>. In such a case, the amount awarded is fixed by reference to the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure, which enables the judge to consider the factors listed in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-705" target="_self">§ 32-705 </a></cite>and incorporated by reference into subsection 2. In this way<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121</a></cite> plays a role in divorce cases without unduly encroaching upon the financial assistance scheme contemplated by subsection (2). Hentges v. Hentges, 115 Idaho 192, 765 P.2d 1094 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where party did not provide a transcript of the proceedings below, appellate court was unable to review the transcript to determine whether the magistrate found that she had sufficient assets to pay her own attorney fees, and, because error will not be presumed on appeal, the magistrate did not abuse his discretion by failing to award attorney fees and costs to said party. Brooks v. Brooks, 119 Idaho 275, 805 P.2d 481 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because it has been the policy of the Idaho supreme court to leave to the trial court, under the authority of this section, the making and enforcing of all orders necessary to provide a spouse with the means of prosecuting or defending an appeal, it was within the magistrate’s discretion to award attorney fees to wife for her defense of husband’s appeal to the district court. Perez v. Perez, 134 Idaho 555, 6 P.3d 411 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney fees pursuant to subsection (2) is not dependent upon who prevails, and the magistrate did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees to the wife for her defense of the appeal to the district court without first determining that the wife was a prevailing party. Perez v. Perez, 134 Idaho 555, 6 P.3d 411 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither a husband nor a wife were granted attorney fees in an appeal from the district court’s decision as to the magistrate’s distribution of their assets pursuant to a divorce action, where neither party had requested an award for such fees in the trial court; however, the husband was awarded costs because he was the prevailing party. Larson v. Larson, 139 Idaho 972, 88 P.3d 1212 (Ct. App. 2003).

        Denial of attorney fees to former wife in action to modify divorce decree by increasing amount of child support was not an abuse of discretion by the trial court where the former wife had denied former husband his child visitation rights and where the former wife testified she could pay attorney fees if required. Heidemann v. Heidemann, 96 Idaho 602, 533 P.2d 96 (1974).

        Great disparity in income between husband and wife was sufficient to support magistrate’s conclusion that husband should pay a share of ex-wife’s attorney’s fees in a custody modification proceeding. Pieper v. Pieper, 125 Idaho 667, 873 P.2d 921 (Ct. App. 1994).

       <p>
        In a support modification case, while further explanation may have been helpful to understand a magistrate’s decision to award a former wife attorney fees, the magistrate met the minimum statutory requirements for awarding attorney fees; it considered and cited the statutory factors listed in its decision. Moreover, the record supported a finding of a disparity in income, since it contained a document entitled “Affidavit Verifying Income” that listed the former husband’s annual income as $72,000 and the former wife’s annual income as $36,750. Davies v. Davies, 160 Idaho 74, 368 P.3d 1017 (Ct. App. 2016). — On Remand.

        A divorce action which is in the district court on remand from the supreme court is still “pending” within the meaning of this section and the trial court has jurisdiction to consider a motion for allowance of attorney’s fees even though the order of remand was silent on the subject.

        The trial court may, pursuant to this section, make awards of costs and attorney fees in post-divorce decree proceedings. The financial resources of the parties must first be considered and then the factors under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-705" target="_self">§ 32-705 </a></cite>must be considered and applied. Because there is no “community” in post-divorce decree proceedings, community property is not liable for these awards. Josephson v. Josephson, 115 Idaho 1142, 772 P.2d 1236 (Ct. App. 1989).

        Where there was adequate evidence presented to demonstrate a disparity in incomes relating to the parties’ abilities to carry on an appeal of a child custody award, the magistrate judge was within his discretion in ordering the father to pay a portion of the mother’s attorney fees. The mother was not able to make ends meet and pay her attorney fees at the same time. The magistrate erred in making it an open-ended award without any determination about what a reasonable attorney fee would be. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).

        This section vests original jurisdiction in the district court in a proper case to require the husband during the pendency of an appeal from a judgment in a divorce case to pay such sums as may be necessary to prosecute or defend the action, and the question of whether an award should be made, and, if made, the issue as to the amount necessary to pay costs and attorney’s fees on appeal are both addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and its order therein will not be reversed in the absence of an abuse of such discretion. Losee v. Losee, 91 Idaho 77, 415 P.2d 720 (1966) (Decision prior to 1980 amendment).
    In the absence of a showing that wife was unable to finance divorce litigation and support herself, the trial court’s limiting of temporary allowance when the wife found full-time employment and failure to make adjustment for wife’s cost was not an abuse of the trial court’s discretion under this section.

        The court did not err in granting support plus educational expenses to the wife, where the court found that the wife’s personal property and her share of community property were insufficient to meet her needs and that the wife was unable to support herself through employment. Shurtliff v. Shurtliff, 112 Idaho 1031, 739 P.2d 330 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The award of attorney fees in divorce actions and marital property divisions has long been the province of the trial court and the court is also bound by the standard pronounced in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-704" target="_self">§ 32-704 </a></cite>and this section. Beesley v. Beesley, 114 Idaho 432, 758 P.2d 695 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it was found that 48 year old spouse was the “innocent spouse”; that she lacked sufficient property to support herself; that she could not obtain employment at the time of the divorce because her medical technician skills were outdated; and that it would take approximately two to three years for her to retrain herself and these findings were supported by substantial evidence, award of permanent alimony was correct. McNelis v. McNelis, 119 Idaho 349, 806 P.2d 442 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard applied by the magistrate inappropriately focused upon wife’s financial position existing prior to her marriage but what lifestyle would have been warranted in light of the spouses’ incomes and resources during the marriage should have been considered. Campbell v. Campbell, 120 Idaho 394, 816 P.2d 350 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial and competent evidence to support the trial court’s consideration of husband’s overtime wages. Mulch v. Mulch, 125 Idaho 93, 867 P.2d 967 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence showed that 51-year-old wife had spent 28 of her 31 years of marriage as a homemaker and was just attempting to reenter the job market, had received a degree and teaching certificate and although only working part-time at the time of the divorce was capable of obtaining full-time employment but there were not permanent employment prospects in the near future, she met burden under this section by showing that she lacked reasonable property to provide for her reasonable needs and was unable to support herself through employment and award of maintenance was proper; however, such award should not be permanent but only be granted for a period of three years to allow her time to to obtain full-time employment and establish herself financially. Tisdale v. Tisdale, 127 Idaho 331, 900 P.2d 807 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court did not err in awarding wife three years of maintenance where it took into account the wife’s ability to meet her needs independent of any spousal support and the husband’s ability to meet his own needs while also meeting the wife’s needs. Robinson v. Robinson, 136 Idaho 451, 35 P.3d 268 (2001).

       <p>
        The magistrate court did not abuse its discretion by granting the wife a spousal maintenance award, because she lacked sufficient income to provide for her reasonable needs or to support herself even with full time employment. The court considered the longevity of the parties’ marriage, along with the wife’s limited English skills, age, and lack of employment history. Pelayo v. Pelayo, 154 Idaho 855, 303 P.3d 214 (2013).

        The trial court may, pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-704" target="_self">§ 32-704</a></cite>, make awards of costs and attorney fees in post-divorce decree proceedings. The financial resources of the parties must first be considered and then the factors under this section must be considered and applied. Because there is no “community” in post-divorce decree proceedings, community property is not liable for these awards. Josephson v. Josephson, 115 Idaho 1142, 772 P.2d 1236 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court found that wife did not have adequate resources to pay her attorney fees incurred in divorce action, where it found that husband had sufficient assets to pay for psychological treatment for the children and that wife did not, where it took notice of the fact that husband had the ability to pay attorney fees incurred in the enforcement of a maintenance order and that wife did not, and, where the court found that husband had the capacity to make previously ordered support payments when it found him in contempt for failure to pay them, the court must make it clear whether those findings were made in the context of this section regarding award of costs and attorney’s fees. Jones v. Jones, 117 Idaho 621, 790 P.2d 914 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a court to award attorney fees under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-704" target="_self">§ 32-704</a></cite>(2), it must consider the financial resources of the parties and the factors in this section. Bell v. Bell, 122 Idaho 520, 835 P.2d 1331 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court did not cite the factors listed in this section as a basis for including wife’s attorney fees as part of the community debt, trial court’s award was reversed and remanded. Smith v. Smith, 124 Idaho 431, 860 P.2d 634 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the magistrate made specific findings of fact in exercising its discretion regarding the award of attorney fees and expert witness fees, he did not abuse his discretion in ordering that each party was responsible for his or her own respective attorney fees and that one party was responsible for the expert fees. McAffee v. McAffee, 132 Idaho 281, 971 P.2d 734 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees as the husband earned approximately 84 percent of the parties’ combined income and also owned investment and income-producing property; although the wife was awarded assets of a significant value in the divorce, many of the assets, such as the house and other real property, were not liquid. Stephens v. Stephens, 138 Idaho 195, 61 P.3d 63 (Ct. App. 2002).

Jensen v. Jensen, 128 Idaho 600, 917 P.2d 757 (1996).

        The magistrate did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-704" target="_self">§ 32-704</a></cite>(3) where the magistrate found that a substantial disparity existed between the incomes of the parties, that the wife was incapable of paying her own attorney fees, and that the husband could afford to pay those fees for her, and these findings were supported by substantial and competent evidence contained in the record. Perez v. Perez, 134 Idaho 555, 6 P.3d 411 (Ct. App. 2000).
    Where there was adequate evidence presented to demonstrate a disparity in incomes relating to the parties’ abilities to carry on an appeal of a child custody award, the magistrate judge was within his discretion in ordering the father to pay a portion of the mother’s attorney fees. The mother was not able to make ends meet and pay her attorney fees at the same time. The magistrate erred in making it an open-ended award without any determination about what a reasonable attorney fee would be. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).

        In a proceeding to modify a divorce decree, where it was determined that the defenses of the party objecting to the proposed modification were not pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation and where the magistrate’s decision did not apply the factors set forth in this section, the magistrate’s decision to award attorney fees was in error and could not be upheld.

        Where the trial court found that wife was able to support herself through employment and she was underemployed and where husband did not have the ability to pay wife’s attorney fees because he was supporting another family and would be paying increased child support, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to award attorney fees to wife. Ireland v. Ireland, 123 Idaho 955, 855 P.2d 40 (1993), overruled on other grounds, Zenner v. Holcomb, 147 Idaho 444, 210 P.3d 552 (2009).

        Award in divorce proceeding of amount of money as “equitable restitution” as compensation for ex-wife’s support of ex-husband during medical school was not in the nature of support under Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5), and was therefore dischargeable.

        Although the spousal maintenance provisions of this section do not contemplate burdening the husband with unlimited schooling expenses for such purposes as cultural refinement or excessively expensive curricula, this section does contemplate that there are situations where initial higher spousal support levels are justified for retraining purposes where such training would tend to facilitate the achievement of enhanced earning capacity and early return to economic self-sufficiency.

Jones v. Jones, 117 Idaho 621, 790 P.2d 914 (1990).
    An award of maintenance requires initially a finding by the court that the party being charged with maintenance is at fault and the party seeking maintenance is an innocent spouse, to be followed by consideration of the need of the party seeking maintenance.

        Prior to the amendment of this section in 1990, the fault of the other party was a prerequisite to an award of maintenance to be applied retroactively; the 1990 amendments were meant to eliminate fault as a prerequisite, relegating it to one of many factors to be considered.

        Even though the magistrate judge did not specify how he calculated the duration and the amount of spousal maintenance award, the judge’s decision was affirmed because the record contained substantial and competent evidence to support the judge’s findings as to duration and the amount of the award.

        Magistrate judge’s award of spousal support to a former wife for twelve years was supported by substantial evidence, in light of: (1) the dramatically different earning capacity of the husband, calculated to 25 times that of the wife; (2) the wife’s future inability to support herself when she had a progressive disability; and (3) the parties’ monthly expenses. The community property awarded to the wife did not render the amount of spousal support excessive because nothing required the wife to exhaust her assets before an award of maintenance was appropriate.

        This section was revised in 1990 to remove fault as a requirement for the award of alimony and to denote, as the primary basis for alimony awards, the need of one spouse and the ability of the other spouse to pay. However, unless the terms of a statute show a clear legislative intent that it should be applied retroactively, a statute should have a prospective operation only. Marmon v.

        While there is nothing in this section that permits a trial court to consider a spouse’s retirement needs when deciding whether to award maintenance; it was harmless error for the court to do so, because the remaining portions of the court’s rationale, the lack of sufficient property and inability of wife to support herself through employment, was sufficient in itself to grant a temporary maintenance order.

       <p>
        In a support modification case, while further explanation may have been helpful to understand a magistrate’s decision to award a former wife attorney fees, the magistrate met the minimum statutory requirements for awarding attorney fees; it considered and cited the statutory factors listed in its decision. Moreover, the record supported a finding of a disparity in income, since it contained a document entitled “Affidavit Verifying Income” that listed the former husband’s annual income as $72,000 and the former wife’s annual income as $36,750.

        An award of alimony to a divorced wife in such amount as the trial court deems just is proper whenever the husband is not free from fault, and the wife’s fault, though possibly sufficient to allow a divorce in favor of the husband, is not so grievous as to mandate a denial of alimony.

        Power over subject matter of alimony is not exhausted by entry of original order and decree of divorce, but is continued for the purpose, at any time, of making such alterations as may appear to the court, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, reasonable and proper. Humbird v. Humbird, 42 Idaho 29, 243 P. 827 (1926); McHan v. McHan, 59 Idaho 496, 84 P.2d 984 (1938).

        Payment of $200 per month alimony should continue until such time as it is shown to the court that appellant is no longer in need of alimony or that circumstances and conditions of the parties warrant a modification. Nielsen v. Nielsen, 87 Idaho 578, 394 P.2d 625 (1964).

        The authority to modify under this section cannot be extended to modification of an agreement of the parties; for only when there has been a merger of the agreement into the decree itself does the court have the authority to make such a modification, and any modification is then of the court’s order and not of the agreement.

        Where the decree contains no provision for an award of alimony, no modification of decree can be made once the time for appeal has elapsed. Perovitz v. Perovitz, 94 Idaho 453, 490 P.2d 320 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the alimony provision of former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-706" target="_self">§ 32-706 </a></cite>(repealed) that “the court may, from time to time, modify its orders in these respects,” Idaho case law had long held that when the original divorce decree contained no provision for an award of alimony, a court had no authority to subsequently modify that decree to provide for an award of alimony. Mercer v. Mercer, 102 Idaho 816, 641 P.2d 1003 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no formal provision in a divorce decree retaining jurisdiction, the court did not have the jurisdiction to modify fixed-term spousal support after the expiration of the term. Mercer v. Mercer, 102 Idaho 816, 641 P.2d 1003 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court ordinarily was without power to modify an alimony award beyond the duration of the time fixed by the original decree for payment of alimony, provided that those payments had been made and there had been no appeal from the final decree which declared the obligation, and fixed its limited duration. Mercer v. Mercer, 102 Idaho 816, 641 P.2d 1003 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an original divorce decree providing for alimony was modified by an order terminating alimony payments and no appeal was taken from that order, there was no residual authority in the trial court to later on allow alimony; there simply was no longer an action pending between the parties and hence the parties were no longer before the court. Mercer v. Mercer, 102 Idaho 816, 641 P.2d 1003 (Ct. App. 1982).

       <p>
        Where a previous order terminating alimony payments has become final, the time for amendment having expired with no appeal taken, trial court was without power to modify it, having no residual authority to do so; therefore, trial court correctly granted a motion to dismiss a motion to modify.

        When a major portion of an award is found to have been made erroneously, it is only equitable that the trial court review the disposition of the community property and the allowance of the wife’s support so that ultimate disposition of the property is fairly and equitably made with adequate allowance for the wife’s support.

        In suit by husband, a resident of Canada, against wife, a resident of Michigan, for divorce based on five years’ separation, where evidence showed that wife helped husband to develop his business and where husband had a business valued at $27,000 and wife lived in a “shack” and had borrowed $1,400 to come to Idaho to defend proceeding, an award of alimony for $2,000 was insufficient, and supreme court increased award to $8,000.

       </p>
       <p>
        Alimony is not a vested right but is designed solely for the support of the wife; it is granted at the court’s discretion and is subject to modification. Jackson v. Jackson, 87 Idaho 330, 393 P.2d 28 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the circumstances, the sum of $200.00 per month as alimony was adequate; however, it was error to limit the alimony payments to a period of one year, as such termination would necessarily rest on speculation or conjecture and was unwarranted. Nielsen v. Nielsen, 87 Idaho 578, 394 P.2d 625 (1964).

        In awarding alimony, the court should give due consideration to the correlative needs and abilities of both parties. Shepard v. Shepard, 94 Idaho 734, 497 P.2d 321 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not err in denying wife an award of permanent alimony, where the trial court had given due consideration to the needs and abilities of the parties and the equity of the situation. Mifflin v. Mifflin, 97 Idaho 895, 556 P.2d 854 (1976).

       If the child continues his high school education subsequent to reaching the age of eighteen (18) years, the court may, in its discretion, and after considering all relevant factors which include those set forth in subsection (1) of this section, order the continuation of support payments until the child discontinues his high school education or reaches the age of nineteen (19) years, whichever is sooner.

       The legislature hereby authorizes and encourages the supreme court of the state of Idaho to adopt and to periodically review for modification guidelines that utilize and implement the factors set forth in subsections (1) through (4) of this section to create a uniform procedure for reaching fair and adequate child support awards. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines is the amount of child support to be awarded, unless evidence is presented in a particular case that indicates that an application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. If the court determines that circumstances exist to permit a departure from the guidelines, the judge making the determination shall make a written or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case before the court. When adopting guidelines, the supreme court shall provide that in a proceeding to modify an existing award, children of the party requesting the modification who are born or adopted after the entry of the existing order shall not be considered.
    (6) If the court awards one (1) parent the right to claim tax benefits associated with his child or children, the court order need not list every applicable tax benefit. The parent who was awarded the tax benefits for the child or children shall attach a copy of the court order to his income tax return. The state tax commission shall recognize the award of tax benefits with respect to the child or children as applying to the child tax credit under section 63-3029L, Idaho Code, the food tax credit under section 63-3024A, Idaho Code, and any and all other state and federal tax deductions, exemptions, and credits for which the parent qualifies, unless the court order specifies otherwise.

        Although it may be debated whether child support levels should be fixed by reference to factors other than need and ability to pay, it is permissible under federal law and this section to take the value of the income tax dependency exemption into account, thereby indirectly allocating its economic value between the parties.

Nonetheless, the authority to require execution of a tax exemption waiver is an alternative which the divorce courts of this state should have available to utilize under the proper circumstances. Rohr v. Rohr, 118 Idaho 689, 800 P.2d 85 (1990).

        Modification.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Determining whether the child support provisions of a divorce decree should be modified essentially is a two-step process; first, the trial court must determine whether a substantial, material change of circumstances has occurred warranting a modification; second, the trial court must determine the amount of the modification, considering all relevant factors, especially those enumerated in this section. Howard v. Mecham, 117 Idaho 542, 789 P.2d 538 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate may not modify child support where there was no basis for the modification other than that it appeared to conform with certain proposed guidelines that were not in effect at the time of the proposed modification and which, in fact, were not eventually adopted. Howard v. Mecham, 117 Idaho 542, 789 P.2d 538 (Ct. App. 1990).
    Trial court abused its discretion in determining the amount of increase in child support ordered and in requiring such payments to be made retroactively from the date of filing of motion to modify the child support award, since its order was based on figure used by parent requesting a change in custody based on expenses that would come about as a result of change in custody. No change in custody occurred and, therefore, such figure was irrelevant and did not provide a rational basis for the trial court’s decision. Levin v. Levin, 122 Idaho 583, 836 P.2d 529 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where magistrate’s order finding a material, permanent and substantial change in circumstances and increasing child support payments was based partially upon its erroneous collateral attack upon the prior court’s support order, the magistrate’s finding was vacated and the court was directed to reconsider the issue of whether there was a material, permanent and substantial change in the circumstances relating to child support. Levin v. Levin, 122 Idaho 583, 836 P.2d 529 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person seeking modification of a divorce decree provision for child support must show a substantial and material change of circumstances occurring after the last order affecting the support obligation. When presented with such a request, the trial court must first determine whether a substantial, material change of circumstances has occurred warranting a modification. If a modification is found to be justified, the trial court must then determine the amount of the modification, considering all relevant factors, especially those enumerated in this section. Rohr v. Rohr, 126 Idaho 1, 878 P.2d 175 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was substantial, competent evidence in the record to support the magistrate’s finding that a father’s reduced gross income combined with the birth of another child by his current wife and that child’s need for support constituted a permanent, material, and substantial change of circumstances since the last order modifying the divorce decree, there was no error in the magistrate’s granting the father’s petition for modification, despite the fact that the parties’ divorce decree was contemporaneously the subject of an appeal before the Idaho Court of Appeals. Rohr v. Rohr, 128 Idaho 137, 911 P.2d 133 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there was evidence of material and substantial change of circumstances warranting the magistrate’s modification of the divorce decree, where the magistrate did not provide the methodology or calculations it used in concluding the father’s monthly gross income and his total annual income, there was no substantial and competent evidence to support his findings, thus on appeal the calculations were reversed. Rohr v. Rohr, 128 Idaho 137, 911 P.2d 133 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate did not err in correcting the father’s child support obligations where this section listed relevant factors that a court had to consider when determining the amount of child support either parent owed, and the actual tax benefit recognized by the part claiming the federal child dependency exemption was one such factor. Silsby v. Kepner, 140 Idaho 412, 95 P.3d 30 (Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in affirming a magistrate’s denial of a mother’s motion to modify child support because, while the parties were represented by counsel when they entered into a child support agreement, the original judgment called for a significant, unsubstantiated deviation from the Idaho child support guidelines and no facts were ever elicited to rebut the statutory or guidelines presumptions and no reasons were given as to why the guidelines were not followed. The original support amount was a gross and substantial deviation from the guidelines and constituted a material change itself. Garner v. Garner, 158 Idaho 932, 354 P.3d 494 (2015).

        New Marital Community Income.
       </h5>
       <p>
        While considering a father’s petition for modification of child support, a district court and a magistrate were not required to consider a mother’s interest in her new husband’s income in computing her share of a child support obligation, as no compelling reason for such consideration existed. The disparity between the father’s income and that of the mother’s new marital community was insufficient, in itself, to constitute a compelling circumstance. Harris v. Carter, 146 Idaho 22, 189 P.3d 484 (Ct. App. 2008).

       <p>
        Granting of the father’s motion to dismiss the mother’s request for the reinstatement of child support was improper pursuant to subsection (2) because there were no grounds to impose a requirement that a request for support under subsection (2) be initiated before the subject child reached 18.

        Trial judges in divorce cases should state reasons for their decisions on disputed child support and attorney fee issues, unless those reasons are otherwise obvious from the record; the statement need not be lengthy and it may only consist of brief remarks in open court. But regardless of form, the statement at a minimum should note the existence of the legislative guidelines and should identify those factors which the judge has weighed in arriving at his decision.

       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate erred in applying a cap rather than an evidence driven standard in determining whether any additional support above the combined guidelines income figure of $70,000.00 was appropriate in action involving modification of child support; although magistrate increased father’s child support under Idaho child support guidelines (guidelines) he inappropriately shifted the burden of proof to mother regarding factors set forth under guidelines instead of analyzing the income of the parties and the requirements of the children.

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in believing the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c11s7-1121" target="_blank">§ 7-1121 </a></cite>justified the award of child support until age 21 if the child was pursuing his education, because the trial court’s expansion by analogy of the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c11s7-1121" target="_blank">§ 7-1121 </a></cite>conflicts with the pre-1991 version of this section, where the minor child became 18 years of age in June of 1990 and the 1990 amendment to this section that provided for continuing support did not become effective until July of 1990. Walborn v. Walborn, 120 Idaho 494, 817 P.2d 160 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A provision in plaintiff’s settlement agreement requiring plaintiff to pay for half of his children’s college education was held to be a provision requiring post-majority child support and due to the merger of the settlement agreement into the divorce decree, the agreement, including that of post-majority child support potentially beyond the requirement of subsection (2). of this section, was no longer enforceable as a separate contractual obligation and ex-wife could not enforce the agreement through an action on the divorce decree. Noble v. Fisher, 126 Idaho 885, 894 P.2d 118 (1995).

        The issue of defendant’s contempt for failure to support child was an issue to be decided in contempt proceedings and plaintiff’s contention in the premises was without merit, she merely alleging him to be presently in contempt, such allegation not to be substituted for the procedural requisites of the statute on contempt, especially since alleged contempt was not one committed before the court.

        The court is authorized to make provision for the support and education of the children of the marriage and in so doing, to subject the community property to that purpose and to require security therefor and enforce the same by receiver or by any other remedy applicable to the case. The establishment of a trust of community property was an applicable remedy and a method of subjecting that property to the support and education of the children, and was within the jurisdiction of the court.

        There was no abuse of discretion by trial court in denying petition to modify divorce decree so as to increase support allowed for minor child where petition failed to allege a material change in condition of the parties. Fish v. Fish, 67 Idaho 78, 170 P.2d 802 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the child is a minor is not the sole criterion of a court’s power or jurisdiction to modify the child maintenance obligations of the original decree; rather, the fact of dependency of the child constitutes the governing criterion to be considered in imposing the obligation, and thereafter in continuing, modifying or terminating such obligation. Embree v. Embree, 85 Idaho 443, 380 P.2d 216 (1963).
    An application for modification of a decree awarding a child support upon the ground of a material permanent change in the circumstances of the parties since the entry of the decree, is addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the trial court. Embree v. Embree, 85 Idaho 443, 380 P.2d 216 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence in regard to the age, health and self-sufficiency of the son of the parties and as regards defendant-father’s bad physical condition and his reduced earnings was competent and substantial and sufficient to sustain the trial court’s order of modification. Embree v. Embree, 85 Idaho 443, 380 P.2d 216 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority to modify cannot be extended to modification of an agreement of the parties; for only when there has been a merger of the agreement into the decree itself does the court have the authority to make such a modification, and any modification is then of the court’s order and not of the agreement.

        Where a court requires a husband to provide support for a wife it must resort first, to the community property and then to the separate property of the husband, and where the wife does not have sufficient separate estate and there is insufficient community property to provide for her support, the separate property of the husband may be applied thereto.

        Where present owners of a tract of land were not strangers but were successors in estate and privies of the divorced parties, they were bound by the decree awarding the husband’s property to the wife in trust for the use and benefit of the children to the same extent and under the same rules as applicable to divorced parties.

        If there is no community property, the trial court must look to separate property of husband in making an award for alimony. Jolliffe v. Jolliffe, 76 Idaho 95, 278 P.2d 200 (1954) (Decision prior to 1980 amendment).

       <p>
        Inasmuch as this section mandated that a court resort first to community property in making allowances for wife’s attorney fees and temporary support, the trial court was in error in setting off the community interest in a separate property residence against the husband’s previously decreed temporary support, attorney fee obligations and community debts.

        The husband’s payment of all community obligations and approximately $5,000 for the wife’s temporary support and attorney’s fees should be satisfied first from community property before an order for the equitable division of community property.

        Since the propriety of magistrate’s order denying wife’s motion for summary judgment regarding modification of spousal support was the only issue presented on appeal to the district court, and because the correctness of that order was not a proper subject for review on appeal, the district court did not err in dismissing the appeal.

    Magistrate properly held that a father was voluntarily underemployed when he sought a reduction in his child support obligation based on a substantial change in circumstances because the father’s decision to leave a well-paying job in California where he had earned significant seniority coincided with the scheduled increase in his child support obligation.

        Where wife was granted maintenance for a period of three years in order to allow her time to obtain full employment and establish herself financially, she could under this section seek an extension of the three-year period, but would be required to show that a substantial and material change in circumstances had occurred in order to justify such a continuance.

        Determining whether the child support provisions of a divorce decree should be modified essentially is a two-step process; first, the trial court must determine whether a substantial, material change of circumstances has occurred warranting a modification; second, the trial court must determine the amount of the modification, considering all relevant factors, especially those enumerated in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-706" target="_self">§ 32-706</a></cite>.

        A person seeking modification of a divorce decree provision for child support must show a substantial and material change of circumstances occurring after the last order affecting the support obligation. When presented with such a request, the trial court must first determine whether a substantial, material change of circumstances has occurred warranting a modification.

Rohr v. Rohr, 126 Idaho 1, 878 P.2d 175 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was substantial, competent evidence in the record to support the magistrate’s finding that a father’s reduced gross income combined with the birth of another child by his current wife and that child’s need for support constituted a permanent, material, and substantial change of circumstances since the last order modifying the divorce decree, there was no error in the magistrate’s granting the father’s petition for modification, despite the fact that the parties’ divorce decree was contemporaneously the subject of an appeal before the Idaho court of appeals. Rohr v. Rohr, 128 Idaho 137, 911 P.2d 133 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a parent filed his petition for modification of his divorce decree, having incurred and paid ongoing expenses for his newborn child, having determined that a substantial and material change of circumstances had occurred since the divorce decree sufficient to warrant modification of the decree, the magistrate should have retroactively applied the child support modification, as of the date on which the petition to modify was filed. Rohr v. Rohr, 128 Idaho 137, 911 P.2d 133 (1996).

        Magistrate may not modify child support where there was no basis for the modification other than that it appeared to conform with certain proposed guidelines that were not in effect at the time of the proposed modification and which, in fact, were not eventually adopted.

       <p>
        If a judge finds that the needs of a child or of a former spouse are likely to change in the future, and that resources to meet the changing needs are likely to be available, the judge may prescribe support schedules containing future adjustments. Brazier v. Brazier, 111 Idaho 692, 726 P.2d 1143 (Ct. App. 1986), overruled on other grounds, Swope v. Swope, 112 Idaho 974, 739 P.2d 273 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where provision of divorce decree permitting reduction in support payments due to onset of disability was self executing, reduction of spousal support due to payor’s spouse’s disability did not require judicial approval prior to abatement of payments. Although such an automatic future adjustment clause does not inhibit the court’s continuing jurisdiction to modify an award when presented with “a substantial and material change of circumstances,” no such change in circumstances had been asserted and denial of judgment was affirmed. Toyama v. Toyama, 129 Idaho 142, 922 P.2d 1068 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to minimize the number of occasions when divorce decrees must be disturbed. The purpose is well served by providing for automatic future adjustments in payments, even when the factor upon which the automatic adjustment hinges is somewhat uncertain. Keller v.

        Where the obligor parent was sentenced to an indeterminate term of eight years in prison, and at the time his motion to modify the decree for child support was filed, he still had more than six years to serve, but since he could be paroled earlier, his motion to modify support decree should not be denied merely because he probably would not be incarcerated for the remainder of his life, therefore, the action was remanded for further consideration by the magistrate.

Keller v. Keller, 130 Idaho 661, 946 P.2d 623 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Incarceration and the associated possibility of reduction in income for an extended, but nonetheless limited period, is not insufficient in permanence for a court to modify the amount of support required. Instead, the period for which a change in circumstances is anticipated to exist, and its permanence, should be two of the factors to be considered by the trial court in determining whether a change in circumstances is “substantial.” Nab v. Nab, 114 Idaho 512, 757 P.2d 1231 (Ct. App. 1988).

        A mutual mistake of fact as to the legal status of a child for whom husband in divorce action had power of attorney but to whom he was neither the natural nor adoptive father, and his mistaken belief that he had a duty to pay support for said child, were not substantial and material changes of circumstances.

        The magistrate court’s decision to modify a divorce decree to order wife to pay child support to ex-husband was affirmed because “a showing of a substantial and material change of circumstances” existed where wife, who at the time of the final decree earned no income, was now earning $25,000 per year, was receiving a portion of ex-husband’s military retirement benefits and was remarried to a new husband earning approximately $47,000 per year.

        Where magistrate found that a substantial and material change of circumstances had occurred since the original decree was entered which justified increasing plaintiff’s child support obligation under this section as plaintiff had realized a significant increase in his income due to a salary increase in his primary job and the additional salary from a part-time job, there were increased costs of childrearing, and adoption of the Idaho Child Support Guidelines at Idaho R. Civ. P. 6(c)(6) had occurred since the time of the parties’ divorce, the district court did not abuse its discretion in affirming the decision of the magistrate court that plaintiff’s income from his second job should be considered in determining his child support obligation.

        Property Settlement Agreements.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The fact that the property settlement agreement is merged into divorce decree is not alone sufficient to authorize modification of the decree by the court, for only where payments provided for by the agreement are separable from the provisions relative to the division of property or where the payments for support and maintenance are not so integrated that they constitute reciprocal consideration for the division of property can the court modify such agreement. Kimball v. Kimball, 83 Idaho 12, 356 P.2d 919 (1960).
    Where there is no merger of a property settlement agreement into the divorce decree, the agreement itself governs, and the terms of the agreement being otherwise valid, they are not subject to being rewritten or modified by the court without the consent of both parties. Kimball v. Kimball, 83 Idaho 12, 356 P.2d 919 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of trial court to modify provisions of decrees providing for support and maintenance of wife cannot be extended to modification of an agreement of the parties, for only when there has been a merger of the agreement into the decree itself does the court have authority to make such a modification, and any modification is then of the court’s order and not of the agreement. Kimball v. Kimball, 83 Idaho 12, 356 P.2d 919 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parties in property settlement agreement provided that in consideration of property transfer husband promised to pay wife $2500 immediately and $150 a month thereafter, they clearly intended that the provision for monthly payments be an inseparable, indivisible and integral part of such agreement, and the trial court had no power to modify monthly payment provision without parties’ expressed consent even though the agreement had been incorporated into divorce decree. Kimball v. Kimball, 83 Idaho 12, 356 P.2d 919 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule that a court has no authority to modify a property settlement agreement that has been merely ratified or approved by the court but not merged into the court’s decree would not apply where the court, in addition to stating in its decree that the property settlement agreement “is hereby ratified, confirmed and approved, but is not merged herein,” also specifically ordered the defendant to make alimony payments; accordingly, the trial court had continuing jurisdiction to modify the alimony award under former section governing modification of alimony awards.

       Effective October 1, 1998, all payments for child support ordered pursuant to any decree of divorce or other order for support shall be paid, unless otherwise ordered by the court, to the department of health and welfare. The department shall keep a record of payments made under said order or decree and shall, within two (2) business days of receipt of such payment, transmit said payments to the person or persons entitled thereto by virtue of said order or decree. Whenever a child is in the physical care of a person or entity other than its parents and the department of health and welfare is providing child support services under title IV-D of the social security act, the department may, after written notice to the obligor and obligee and the opportunity for hearing set forth in paragraphs 1. through 3. of this subsection transmit payments under an order of support for said child to the person or entity who has physical care of said child, without further order of the court, whether or not such person or entity is the obligee under the support order.

       All child support orders shall provide that the order will be enforced by income withholding pursuant to chapter 12, title 32, Idaho Code. Failure to include this provision does not affect the validity of the support order or decree.

      § 32-712. Community property and homestead — Disposition.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In case of divorce by the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, the community property and the homestead must be assigned as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c07s32-712ol11">
       The community property must be assigned by the court in such proportions as the court, from all the facts of the case and the condition of the parties, deems just, with due consideration of the following factors:
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t32c07s32-712ol1a">
       Unless there are compelling reasons otherwise, there shall be a substantially equal division in value, considering debts, between the spouses.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c07s32-712ol1b">
       Factors which may bear upon whether a division shall be equal, or the manner of division, include, but are not limited to:
       <ol>
        <li id="t32c07s32-712ol1b1">
         Duration of the marriage;
        </li>
        <li id="t32c07s32-712ol1b2">
         Any antenuptial agreement of the parties; provided, however, that the court shall have no authority to amend or rescind any such agreement;
        </li>
        <li id="t32c07s32-712ol1b3">
         The age, health, occupation, amount and source of income, vocational skills, employability, and liabilities of each spouse;
        </li>
        <li id="t32c07s32-712ol1b4">
         The needs of each spouse;
        </li>

        </li>

         The present and potential earning capability of each party; and
        </li>

         Retirement benefits, including, but not limited to, social security, civil service, military and railroad retirement benefits.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      2. If a homestead has been selected from the community property, it may be assigned to either party, either absolutely, provided such assignment is considered in distribution of the community property, or for a limited period, subject in the latter case to the future disposition of the court; or it may be divided or be sold and the proceeds divided.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. If a homestead has been selected from the separate property of either, it must be assigned to the former owner of such property, subject to the power of the court to assign it for a limited period to the other spouse.

        A divorce decree for the wife on the ground of extreme cruelty could not be complained of on her appeal because the decree awarded to her $1,000 in cash instead of an interest in allegedly community realty, where realty was subject to indebtedness far in excess of its value.

       </p>
       <p>
        A qualified domestic relations order is a present separation of future retirement benefits and, under certain circumstances, may be preferable over a cash distribution because it does not place an undue financial strain on either party; but where husband was prepared to make a lump sum payment to wife the magistrate should have included a provision in the qualified domestic relations order that would have given him the option to make a lump sum payment to her within 60 days after judgment was entered representing the present value of her interest in the fixed benefit plan benefits.

        The assignment of the community debts to the husband was not an abuse of discretion, where the findings of fact contained ample justification for the disparate division of property, including the duration of marriage, employability of each spouse, and the present and potential earning capability of each party.

       <p>
        Disposition of community property is, in the first instance, in the discretion of trial court and unless such discretion is abused, judgment will not be disturbed. Donaldson v. Donaldson, 31 Idaho 180, 170 P. 94 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disposition of community property, where divorce is granted on ground of extreme cruelty, is primarily committed to discretion of trial court. Carter v. Carter, 39 Idaho 798, 230 P. 768 (1924); Smiley v. Smiley, 46 Idaho 588, 269 P. 589 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        An appellate court can modify decree of distribution where divorce is granted on grounds of extreme cruelty or adultery, since in such cases its discretion is superior to discretion of trial court. O’Brien v. O’Brien, 73 Idaho 64, 245 P.2d 785 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a marriage is dissolved by decree on the grounds of adultery or extreme cruelty, the trial court has jurisdiction to assign the community property to the respective parties in such proportions as the trial court or the condition of the parties deems just. The decree in such cases is subject to revision on appeal in all particulars including those which are stated to be in the discretion of the court. Linton v. Linton, 78 Idaho 355, 303 P.2d 905 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a divorce is granted on grounds of extreme cruelty, the disposition of the community property is committed to the discretion of the trial judge in the first instance, subject, however, to the paramount and superior discretion of the appellate court, and more than one-half may be awarded non-offending spouse. Farmer v. Farmer, 81 Idaho 251, 340 P.2d 441 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a divorce is granted on the ground of extreme cruelty, the division and disposition of the community property is committed to the discretion of the trial judge primarily, and in the first instance, subject to the paramount and superior discretion of the appellate court. Jordan v. Jordan, 75 Idaho 512, 275 P.2d 669 (1954); Davis v. Davis, 82 Idaho 351, 353 P.2d 1079 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a divorce is granted on the ground of extreme cruelty, the court may divide the community property between the parties in such amounts as in its discretion it may determine to be fair and equitable having regard to the circumstances of the parties. Jolley v. Jolley, 83 Idaho 433, 363 P.2d 1020 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The division of community property between parties to a divorce action by the court is subject to the paramount and superior discretion of the supreme court on appeal who may in the exercise of such discretion award a larger portion of the community property to the unoffending spouse. Jolley v. Jolley, 83 Idaho 433, 363 P.2d 1020 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where divorce is granted the wife on the ground of extreme cruelty, the disposition of community property is committed to the discretion of the trial court in the first instance. Nielsen v. Nielsen, 87 Idaho 578, 394 P.2d 625 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A wife awarded a divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty was not entitled to more than half of the community property as a matter of right, but the trial court had discretionary power to assign the community property in such proportions as it deemed just. Hammond v. Hammond, 92 Idaho 623, 448 P.2d 237 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The division of community property on divorce is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse. A substantially equal division of community property is sufficient; an exact mathematical division is neither required nor likely. Shepard v. Shepard, 94 Idaho 734, 497 P.2d 321 (1972).
    The method employed by the trial court in determining the total value of a tract and dividing that amount equally between the parties was within the discretion vested in it by this section. Hooker v. Hooker, 95 Idaho 518, 511 P.2d 800 (1973).

        Division of community property is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and in absence of clear showing of abuse of such discretion, the award will not be disturbed. Simplot v. Simplot, 96 Idaho 239, 526 P.2d 844 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a divorce is decreed upon the ground of extreme cruelty, the community property must be assigned the proportions that the trial judge deems just. A trial court thus has wide discretion in dividing the community property, and its determination will not be disturbed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Ross v. Ross, 103 Idaho 406, 648 P.2d 1119 (1982), superseded on other grounds, Stephens v. Stephens, 138 Idaho 195, 61 P.3d 63 (Ct. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The threshold choice between substantial equality and some other equitable division of the property is committed to the trial judge’s sound discretion, guided by statutory and case law; if the judge elects an unequal division, the appellate court’s inquiry is whether, in the circumstances of the case, the judge has abused his discretion by doing so. Bailey v. Bailey, 107 Idaho 324, 689 P.2d 216 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a magistrate has set out to achieve equality, his decree will not be disturbed on appeal if it appears — upon substantial and competent, albeit conflicting, evidence — that the parties have received substantially equal shares. Donndelinger v. Donndelinger, 107 Idaho 431, 690 P.2d 366 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section the trial court has the discretion to make a just division of the community property; the division must be substantially equal in value, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise, and maintenance may be considered. Ross v. Ross, 117 Idaho 548, 789 P.2d 1139 (1990).

        The court will, ordinarily, dispose of community property so as to give each spouse sole and immediate control of his or her determined share. Jackson v. Jackson, 87 Idaho 330, 393 P.2d 28 (1964).
    While ordinarily the court should so dispose of the community as to give each spouse sole and immediate control of her or his determined share, where such a settlement would work a hardship, it would otherwise dispose of the community property, and the court’s decree may provide that respondent pay appellant her community share in monthly payments. Jackson v. Jackson, 87 Idaho 330, 393 P.2d 28 (1964).

        In dividing community property between spouses, where husband’s separate business had large retained earnings, court must look to the extent the community would have been benefited if husband’s share of earnings had been distributed to him.

       </p>
       <p>
        Debts which were not evidenced by written instrument but were accounts on the books of the corporation to which they were owed and which had no due dates or interest charge were properly classified as community property and assigned to respondent in the division of the property where it was shown that such debts would be satisfied without expense to the respondent and there was no evidence that such accounts were not debts. Simplot v. Simplot, 96 Idaho 239, 526 P.2d 844 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        In divorce action in which trial court awarded all of a certain stock to the husband and the record did not reveal the basis on which the shares were awarded, such action must be remanded for clarification of the rationale followed in awarding the stock in order to aid the parties in understanding what the trial court intended. Simplot v. Simplot, 96 Idaho 239, 526 P.2d 844 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a division of community property such as stock in a corporation, where the shares are not divided between the parties, but are valued by the trial court and then properties of relatively equal value are distributed to each of the parties, it is essential that the trial court make an accurate determination of the market value of the properties prior to making an award which determination must be based upon competent and substantial evidence. Simplot v. Simplot, 96 Idaho 239, 526 P.2d 844 (1974).

        Although the voidance of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-909" target="_self">§ 32-909 </a></cite>will render both spouses’ post-separation earnings community property, this section provides for the just assignment of community property upon the dissolution of the marriage, regardless of the ground for divorce; the inclusion of all post-separation earnings of both spouses as community property, therefore, neither prohibits nor requires that they be assigned to the spouse who earned them. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record contained neither a statement of compelling reasons for dividing the community estate unequally nor a set of findings to indicate substantial equality, the court had to vacate the provisions of the divorce decree which distributed the community property and allocated the community debts. Bailey v. Bailey, 107 Idaho 324, 689 P.2d 216 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In dividing the community estate, a trial court must determine the extent and value of the community property, then deduct the community debts outstanding at the time of trial, as well as any attorney fees or support payments required to be made with community funds, and then distribute the balance to the spouses. Donndelinger v. Donndelinger, 107 Idaho 431, 690 P.2d 366 (Ct. App. 1984).
    The method by which the property is distributed is left to the discretion of the trial court, but ordinarily the trial court should divide the community property in such a way as to give each spouse the sole and immediate control of his or her share of the property; thus, to give each spouse the immediate control of his or her share of the property, the trial court may provide for the sale of community property so long as the sale order does not amount to waste of a community asset or provide that the property be sold for less than it is worth.

        Magistrate abused his discretion by failing to follow the mandate of subsection (1) of this section, namely, by refusing to consider whether decree provided for a substantially equal division in value of the community property, taking into account the military retirement benefit.

        Where tax liability of couple was estimated at $30,000 but was actually $11,000, such estimate was an excusable mistake of fact which could support a grant of relief. The next step in the exercise of the magistrate’s discretion should have been to determine whether to grant the motion. Here the court in granting relief must be governed in the exercise of its discretion by the statutes which regulate Idaho divorce actions, and specifically subsection (1)(a) of this section, which mandates a substantially equal division in value, considering debts, between the spouses, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise.

        Allocation of value of dissipated assets during a period of separation to the wife was proper in a divorce action pursuant to this section, although the marital estate no longer had those assets, where there was sufficient evidence to show her intent to dissipate the assets during that time; an unequal division of the proceeds of the parties’ ranch after partition was deemed an abuse of discretion, where such unequal apportionment had been based on the fact that the husband had requested the partition, because the resultant loss of value due to the partition was not a compelling reason to punish the husband by unequal distribution. Larson v. Larson, 139 Idaho 972, 88 P.3d 1212 (Ct. App. 2003).
    The award of the husband’s full 401(k) account to the husband resulted in an unequal division of the marital property with the husband receiving an award of $133,303, while the wife was awarded less than $100,000, in violation of the provisions of this section.

        There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court where the judge decided that the attorneys’ fees of both parties were community debts and were to be satisfied out of the community property before the division, since the awarding and method of payment of attorney fees is a matter which is within the discretion of the trial court.

        Where interest earned on certificate of deposit was directly related to wife’s sole and separate property, little or no community efforts were expended in acquiring the interest, the duration of the marriage was short, wife had to rely upon this investment to provide her with funds with which to pay for all of her living expenses, while husband had his military retirement income as well as income from the sale of his residence, wife had no retirement income or pension plan to aid her in her later years while husband had no needs or worries in that respect, and wife had no marketable skills to enable her to become employed while husband was capable of being employed, the magistrate’s findings of fact and conclusions of law paralleled the factors listed and provided appropriate grounds for unequal distribution of the community property.

        A requirement of specific findings in divorce cases demonstrates to the parties that the trial court has examined their case with due care and attention to the evidence; such a requirement also encourages a judge to rely upon objectively supportable grounds for his decision, and discourages subjective or attitude-influenced perceptions of the case.

       <p>
        In all divorce cases where substantial equality is sought to be achieved not by splitting each asset, but by valuing the assets and allocating them in a manner designed to achieve a substantially equal, aggregate result, the trial judge must make findings concerning the value of each material asset; an asset or debt is “material” if it is sufficiently valuable to affect the substantial equality sought to be achieved by the decree.

        A failure to state specific reasons justifying unequal property division was properly disregarded on appeal from a divorce action in which the sum total of the evidence demonstrated that the husband, as a profoundly disabled person, probably unemployable and saddled with ongoing expenses related to his condition, required a greater share of the community property to support himself, and the reasons clearly appeared from the record.

        A trial court may require a business’s goodwill to be included in the sale. Carr v. Carr, 108 Idaho 684, 701 P.2d 304 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a family-owned business is sold to facilitate a property division in a divorce, the trial court must consider the unique character of goodwill along with the factors in this section to determine whether the goodwill asset should be divided equally; the unique nature of goodwill, its sale by means of a noncompetition clause, its varying importance to the separate individuals of the marital community, and the effect of its sale on the factors listed in this section may constitute compelling reasons to divide the value received for goodwill unequally. The court should also consider the tax consequences (if any) to the parties, vis-/Ga-vis each other and vis-/Ga-vis the buyer of the business, resulting from differing treatment, for tax purposes, of goodwill and of covenants not to compete. Carr v. Carr, 108 Idaho 684, 701 P.2d 304 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal from the disposition of property following a divorce decree, where the parties did not have an interest in the truck stop until after they were married, and all their labor on behalf of the business occurred during coverture, any goodwill value of the business was community property which should have been valued and distributed upon divorce. Carr v. Carr, 108 Idaho 684, 701 P.2d 304 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a property division action as part of divorce, a magistrate judge did not abuse its discretion in determining that a former husband’s medical practice had value in goodwill in excess of the husband’s personal skills when the judge relied on the capitalized excess earnings method to calculate the value and considered other factors that had separate value from the husband’s skills. To the extent a professional services corporation has goodwill value beyond personal assets of knowledge, skill, and background of the professional, that goodwill is community property. Stewart v. Stewart, 143 Idaho 673, 152 P.3d 544 (2007).

        On the granting of a divorce to the wife on the ground of extreme cruelty, the community estate was entitled to be credited, and the husband’s separate estate charged, with expenditures made from the community funds in the improvement of his separate property, but not with expenditures voluntarily made without cost to the community by his children, who were tenants on the property.

    The material assets of the parties must be identified, then it must be determined what assets are separate property and what assets are community property; the separate property assets should be specifically noted and allocated to the proper spouse, and the community property assets must be valued and distributed substantially equally unless the court finds compelling reasons otherwise.

        The evidence presented to the magistrate, which related to the value of the pension benefits, was in the form of account statements showing the contributions made during the marriage and the account balance at the time of marriage and at the time of divorce; any contributions, increases or earnings in the account which occurred prior to the marriage are separate property under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-903" target="_self">§ 32-903</a></cite>, and that portion of the account was reflected in the account balance at the time of marriage; therefore, by subtracting the account balance at the time of marriage from the account balance at the time of divorce, the portion of the contributions and the increases in the account which were acquired during the marriage are identified and there is a rebuttable presumption that all property acquired during marriage — in this case, contributions and increases in the account — is community property.

        By exercising discretion in ordering the parties’ real estate partitioned, the magistrate caused a loss in value of the community property which could not be allocated as part of the property division. Larson v. Larson, 139 Idaho 970, 88 P.3d 1210 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Divorce decree, in which husband was awarded all the equity in the homestead subject to an obligation to pay the wife a portion of her equity, divested the wife of her real property interest in the house and converted it into a lien, which was a personal property interest. Therefore, the wife was not entitled to relief from a sheriff’s sale of the homestead arising from her failure to make certain payments to the husband, because she was provided notice via mail for an execution against personal property. Chavez v. Barrus, 146 Idaho 212, 192 P.3d 1036 (2008).

        Where at the time of the divorce the court did order a sale of the residence, but delayed the sale until the wife remarried or removed herself from the property and the husband did not appeal the divorce decree that included this provision, the district court, in ruling on a suit brought by the husband seeking the value of his interest in the residence, had no jurisdiction to consider anew a sale of the residence.

Malone v. Malone, 64 Idaho 252, 130 P.2d 674 (1942).
    In an effort to avoid additional expense, it was a reasonable exercise of the court’s equitable powers to allow a divorced husband 90 days to effect and account for the sale of the mortgaged community home before a receiver would be appointed to sell the home.

        Transmutation of property is a question of fact turning on intent, and trial courts may consider evidence beyond an unambiguous deed when deciding claims of transmutation of property. Factors to look at include (1) whether the community was liable for payment on the loan; (2) the source of the payments toward the loan; (3) the basis of credit upon which the lender relied in making the loan; (4) the nature of the down payment; (5) the names on the deed; and (6) who signed the documents of indebtedness.

Dunn, 30 Idaho 225, 164 P. 356 (1917); Enders v. Enders, 34 Idaho 381, 201 P. 714 (1921); Hay v. Hay, 40 Idaho 624, 235 P. 902 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Original jurisdiction in matters of granting alimony and suit money in connection with divorce actions is vested in district courts or judges thereof at chambers. Taylor v. Taylor, 33 Idaho 445, 196 P. 211 (1921); Enders v. Enders, 34 Idaho 381, 201 P. 714 (1921); Hay v. Hay, 40 Idaho 624, 235 P. 902 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section vests in district court original jurisdiction to require husband, during pendency of appeal from judgment in divorce action, to pay alimony and suit money in prosecuting or defending appeal. Vollmer v. Vollmer, 43 Idaho 395, 253 P. 622 (1927).
       </p>

       <p>
        District court has jurisdiction of care, custody, and education of minor children of divorced parents. Gifford v. Gifford, 50 Idaho 517, 297 P. 1100 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section confers jurisdiction on the district court in all divorce actions. The trial court has power to provide for the care and custody of the children and of the property pending the suit until entry of final decree, so as to preserve the property from removal, waste or dissipation pending suit. Benson v. District Court, 57 Idaho 85, 62 P.2d 108 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdiction of the trial court over child custodial and visitation rights is a continuing one and should be exercised by the court in such detail and specificity of order as may be necessary to carry out the intent of the court. Dey v. Cunningham, 93 Idaho 684, 471 P.2d 71 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the probate court declared children, of which the district court had granted the custody to the mother in a divorce action, to be dependent and neglected and placed them in a children’s home, in an action to which neither parent was a party, the district court properly adopted a writ of habeas corpus as a suitable means for inquiring into and determining the right of custody settlement of such children. Spaulding v. Children’s Home Finding & Aid Soc’y, 89 Idaho 10, 402 P.2d 52 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a district court has jurisdiction not only of the divorce proceedings, but continuing jurisdiction over questions involving the custody of minor children, it was acting within its jurisdiction when it found divorced wife in contempt for refusing divorced husband his child visitation rights, so that a writ of prohibition was improperly sought, improvidently issued, and was quashed. Dey v. Cunningham, 93 Idaho 684, 471 P.2d 71 (1970).

      § 32-716. Reconciliation proceedings.
     </h3>
     <p>
      No hearing on the merits upon grounds for divorce shall be held in any action for divorce, and no final decree of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be entered in any such case, except as hereinafter provided, until at least twenty-one (21) days after the commencement of the action and service of process. During such period of twenty-one (21) days, or at any time subsequent and prior to entry of final decree therein, the court, upon application of one (1) of the parties, may require a conference of the parties with a person or persons of his choosing, or persons selected by the court, in order to determine whether or not a reconciliation between the parties is practicable; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the court from making such interim orders as may be just and equitable; provided, further, that nothing herein shall prevent the court from proceeding to try the matter on the merits and enter a final decree of divorce upon the agreement of both parties and with both parties present in person or represented by counsel at such trial.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any action of divorce where grounds for divorce have been established, if the court finds that attempts at reconciliation are practicable and to the best interest of the family, the court may stay the proceedings for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days where there are minor children in the family.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reconciliation procedures herein provided shall not be construed as a condonation on the part of either spouse of acts that may constitute grounds for divorce.

       In an action for divorce the court may, before and after judgment, give such direction for the custody, care and education of the children of the marriage as may seem necessary or proper in the best interests of the children. The court shall consider all relevant factors which may include:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t32c07s32-717ol11a">

       If the parent has a disability as defined in this section, the parent shall have the right to provide evidence and information regarding the manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will enable the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child. The court shall advise the parent of such right. Evaluations of parental fitness shall take into account the use of adaptive equipment and supportive services for parents with disabilities and shall be conducted by, or with the assistance of, a person who has expertise concerning such equipment and services. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any new or additional obligations on state or local governments to purchase or provide adaptive equipment or supportive services for parents with disabilities.

         “Disability” means, with respect to an individual, any mental or physical impairment which substantially limits one (1) or more major life activities of the individual including, but not limited to, self-care, manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning or working, or a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. Disability shall not include transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, other sexual behavior disorders, substance use disorders, compulsive gambling, kleptomania or pyromania. Sexual preference or orientation is not considered an impairment or disability. Whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be determined without consideration of the effect of corrective or mitigating measures used to reduce the effects of the impairment.
        </li>
        <li id="t32c07s32-717ol14c">
         “Supportive services” means services which assist a parent with a disability to compensate for those aspects of their disability which affect their ability to care for their child and which will enable them to discharge their parental responsibilities. The term includes specialized or adapted training, evaluations, or assistance with effective use of adaptive equipment, and accommodations which allow a parent with a disability to benefit from other services, such as braille texts or sign language interpreters.
    (5) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow discrimination on the basis of disability. In any case where the disability of a parent is found by the court to be relevant to an award of custody of a child, the court shall make specific findings concerning the disability and what effect, if any, the court finds the disability has on the best interests of the child.

        Previous agreement between husband and wife does not prevent court from making order for custody of minor children. Hay v. Hay, 40 Idaho 159, 232 P. 895 (1951).
    As between husband and wife, agreement touching custody and maintenance of children will be respected and enforced, but such agreement cannot, as against the children, divest either parent of the duty imposed upon both by law to support and educate them. Beard v. Beard, 53 Idaho 440, 24 P.2d 47 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consent decrees must conform to the agreement of the parties subject to such inherent powers of the court on matters concerning the welfare of the child and subject to its continued jurisdiction to modify support payments under changed conditions. Fisher v. Fisher, 84 Idaho 303, 371 P.2d 847 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court’s jurisdiction over minor children is not lost by a property settlement agreement between the parents which is incorporated into the divorce decree. Patton v. Patton, 88 Idaho 288, 399 P.2d 262 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The husband’s delinquency in payments to the wife for support of their children was an obligation due the wife to compensate her for her past support of such children, but agreement by her to release former husband from back support payments for a consideration was valid and enforceable. Andersen v. Andersen, 89 Idaho 551, 407 P.2d 304 (1965).

        When two minor children were orphaned when their parents were killed in a car accident, the maternal grandmother was named testamentary guardian in accordance with the terms of the parents’ will. When petitioner, paternal grandparents, petitioned for guardianship, the magistrate erred by appointing them as co-guardians; petitioners had no rights under this section, which only applies to divorce proceedings.

        In determining the custody of a minor child, the child’s welfare and best interest is of paramount consideration. Roosma v. Moots, 62 Idaho 450, 112 P.2d 1000 (1941); Fish v. Fish, 67 Idaho 78, 170 P.2d 802 (1946).

       </p>
       <p>
        It is well settled, in this jurisdiction, that in awarding the care, custody and education of minor children, the best interest and welfare of the children is of paramount importance. Maudlin v. Maudlin, 68 Idaho 64, 188 P.2d 323 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court, in exercising its discretion in awarding custody of children, will consider as a paramount factor the welfare and best interest of the child. Brashear v. Brashear, 71 Idaho 158, 228 P.2d 243 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        The welfare and best interest of the minor children are of paramount consideration. Empey v. Empey, 78 Idaho 25, 296 P.2d 1028 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        The welfare and best interests of the minor children are the matters of paramount importance to be considered by the court in determining their custody. Schmitt v. Schmitt, 83 Idaho 300, 362 P.2d 884 (1961).
    The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration and controlling factor in determining the child’s custody. Angleton v. Angleton, 84 Idaho 184, 370 P.2d 788 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The personal desires of the parent and even the wishes of a minor child must yield to the determination of what is best for the child’s ultimate good. Larkin v. Larkin, 85 Idaho 610, 382 P.2d 784 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Of paramount importance in determining custody is the children’s welfare and best interests. Shumway v. Shumway, 106 Idaho 415, 679 P.2d 1133 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining custody, a child’s welfare and best interests are of paramount importance. Roeh v. Roeh, 113 Idaho 557, 746 P.2d 1016 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate was within his discretion in awarding the mother sole legal and physical custody of the children where the record contained substantial and competent evidence that the father’s refusal to communicate with the mother, as well as the difficulty of the joint custodial arrangement, were detrimental to the children’s best interests. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is appropriate for a trial judge to review the living arrangements of a child as part of a review of what is in the best interests of the child and that such a review may include a consideration of persons with whom a parent intends to reside. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        When one parent refuses to communicate with the other in a joint custody setting, where essential decisions involving the care of the children are continually necessary, the best interests of the children are obviously detrimentally affected. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        After the husband pleaded guilty to domestic battery, his wife left Idaho and fled to Oregon with their minor child. The magistrate court abused its discretion by ordering the wife to return with their child to Boise or surrender child custody. It was error for the magistrate court to fail to analyze the child’s best interest. Schultz v. Schultz, 145 Idaho 859, 187 P.3d 1234 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate erred in finding that no “best interest” evidence had been presented by the father. Idaho law does not require the testimony of a psychologist, a doctor, a teacher or any other particular witness in order to establish that a change in the shared custody schedule would be in the best interest of a child. Neither is there a requirement under Idaho law that a child behave badly in the current custody arrangement before a change in visitation in the best interest of the child is warranted. Drinkall v. Drinkall, 150 Idaho 606, 249 P.3d 405 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s determination that it was in the best interest of a child to reside primarily in Idaho was not an abuse of discretion: the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community favored shared custody in Idaho, a move to Nevada with the child’s mother would not have had a positive effect on the child’s relationship with the child’s father, and custody in Idaho promoted more continuity and stability in the child’s life. Clair v. Clair, 153 Idaho 278, 281 P.3d 115 (2012).

        A custody modification conforming to a child custody evaluator’s recommendations was proper where the evidence in the evaluation as it applied to the pertinent statutory factors was correctly weighed; when the mother and father agreed to resolve custody in accordance with the evaluator’s recommendations, they agreed to allow his evaluation to be the only evidence the trial court considered in making its decision as to the children’s best interests. Firmage v. Snow, 158 Idaho 343, 347 P.3d 191 (2015). Child Support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband who earned an average of $4,000 a year was required to pay the sum of $28 each month for the support of each of his children, and in the event of sickness to pay the hospitalization and doctor expenses. Empey v. Empey, 78 Idaho 25, 296 P.2d 1028 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court is authorized to make provision for the support and education of the children of the marriage and, in so doing, to subject the community property to that purpose and to require security therefor and enforce the same by receiver or by any other remedy applicable to the case. The establishment of a trust of community property was an applicable remedy and a method of subjecting that property to the support and education of the children, and was within the jurisdiction of the court. Jones v. State, 85 Idaho 135, 376 P.2d 361 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        In fixing the amount to be paid under the obligation of child support, of primary consideration is the financial ability of the payor. Additionally, in fixing the amount of the payments for child maintenance, not only should the order be predicated upon the payor’s ability to pay, but upon the necessity of the child or children. Embree v. Embree, 85 Idaho 443, 380 P.2d 216 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering the amount to be awarded for support, regard should be given to the social position of the persons involved and award be sufficient to permit a standard of living commensurate with that to which they were accustomed; however, the necessities of the children and the financial ability of the payor to provide are primary considerations. Nielsen v. Nielsen, 87 Idaho 578, 394 P.2d 625 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of trial court’s uncertainty as to the future earnings of the divorced husband, its award of $100 per month for the maintenance of each of four children would not be disturbed. Nielsen v. Nielsen, 87 Idaho 578, 394 P.2d 625 (1964).

        Where divorce is granted for offense of husband and award is made for support of wife and child and thereafter an application is made under the provisions of this section for a modification of the decree upon the ground of permanent change in the circumstances of the parties since the entry of the decree, the court will, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, make such modification of the decree as justice and the changed circumstances of the parties demand. Ashton v. Ashton, 59 Idaho 408, 83 P.2d 991 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority to modify a divorce decree so as to increase the maintenance allowed for a minor child could be exercised only upon a showing of material, permanent, and substantial change in the circumstances and conditions of the parties. Fish v. Fish, 67 Idaho 78, 170 P.2d 802 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where decree “approved, confirmed and ratified” a property settlement agreement providing for support of children at the amount of $150 monthly, the court had jurisdiction thereafter to enter an order reducing amount to $125 monthly. In re Martin, 76 Idaho 179, 279 P.2d 873 (1955).

       <p>
        A modification of child support provisions on ground of change of circumstances where father was injured and child had a car and a job would not be reversed without a clear abuse of the trial court’s discretion. Embree v. Embree, 85 Idaho 443, 380 P.2d 216 (1963).

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior right of mother to custody of child cannot be defeated merely on the argument that father has a superior economic position. Brashear v. Brashear, 71 Idaho 158, 228 P.2d 243 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        All other considerations being equal, a mother will not be deprived of the custody of a child of tender years unless it clearly appears that the welfare of the child demands it. Angleton v. Angleton, 84 Idaho 184, 370 P.2d 788 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        A child’s preference for one parent becomes particularly important as the child grows older and more intelligent and, in determining a child’s custody, a child’s preference should be considered as persuasive, although not controlling. Poesy v. Bunney, 98 Idaho 258, 561 P.2d 400 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where children in the custody of one parent have attempted to see the other parent, the court must weigh the effects of this behavior, together with the ability of the parents to cope with the situation, the hostility which would be generated by each custody choice and all other relevant circumstances. Poesy v. Bunney, 98 Idaho 258, 561 P.2d 400 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although uprooting the child every two weeks to travel and live in alternating locations with alternating people raised serious concerns as to the welfare of the child, there was evidence in the record from the expert supporting the decision of the trial court; therefore, it did not abuse its discretion when it ordered equal joint physical custody between the mother and father. State v. Hart, 142 Idaho 721, 132 P.3d 1249 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate did not err in considering the parents’ employment schedules where the parties’ work schedules and need for third-party child care were relevant to the court’s inquiry, especially given that the father worked a night shift; the trial court considered the other relevant factors even though it gave the father’s work schedule great weight. Silva v. Silva, 142 Idaho 900, 136 P.3d 371 (Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a child custody determination, a magistrate judge heard testimony about certain factors, and the magistrate judge made findings, but it was clear that neither party substantially exceled above the other as a parent. The magistrate judge made his determination of custody based on substantial evidence, and the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion. Navarro v. Yonkers, 144 Idaho 882, 173 P.3d 1141 (2007).
    Award of sole physical custody of two children to the mother was proper where she had served as the children’s primary caregiver their entire lives, she was best able to meet their physical and psychological needs consistently, and the father inappropriately involved the children in his conflict with the mother. Danti v. Danti, 146 Idaho 929, 204 P.3d 1140 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (1), the magistrate judge’s decision to award the father primary physical custody of the children was based on objectively supportable grounds because 1) there was substantial evidence to support the magistrate judge’s finding that the mother’s use of medications might impair her ability to provide proper parental care; 2) the mother did not alert the supreme court to any evidence which called into question the father’s ability to parent; and 3) the magistrate judge was not biased. Schneider v. Schneider, 151 Idaho 415, 258 P.3d 350 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        By awarding the mother the right to care for the children on certain mornings at the father’s home, the magistrate judge in effect awarded her the right to enter and use the father’s separate property, which was impermissible under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-712" target="_self">§ 32-712</a></cite>, as the court had no power or authority to award all or any part of the father’s separate property to the mother as part of the divorce decree.

        Evidence concerning mother’s epilepsy, which was controlled to a degree through medication, her need for nine to ten hours of sleep per night, her migraine headaches and her post-seizure lack of energy, did not sufficiently support court’s finding that it was in the best interest of the children to vest custody in the father, and award of custody to father constituted an abuse of discretion. Moye v. Moye, 102 Idaho 170, 627 P.2d 799 (1981).
       </p>

        Where the trial court relied almost exclusively in its findings of fact upon evidence that was extremely remote in time, and there was no nexus between the mother’s past conduct and present behavior on the mother-child relationship, the magistrate relied upon impermissible factors in his fitness determination under subdivision 5 (now subdivision (1)(e)) of this section, and he failed to make findings based on substantial evidence relevant to the best interests of the child; therefore, the decision of the magistrate court was vacated and the matter remanded for redetermination of the custody question.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to award custody of an eleven-year-old daughter and three-year-old son to the mother and permit twenty-year-old and nineteen-year-old sons to choose the parent with whom they desired to live. Loveland v. Loveland, 91 Idaho 400, 422 P.2d 67 (1967).
    Awarding the legal custody and control of minor children to the husband and actual custody to the wife under the particular circumstances was not an abuse of discretion. Saviers v. Saviers, 92 Idaho 117, 438 P.2d 268 (1968).

        There was no abuse of discretion in awarding custody of the children to the wife on evidence that they were much happier and more well-adjusted when they were in her sole care than when they were with the husband and on failure of the husband, who was a military officer, to show how he could care for the children on a permanent basis, notwithstanding his being subject to military orders at all times.

        In a custody hearing involving a four-year-old retarded child, evidence that the mother had been married and divorced six times, had travelled from state to state in her employment, and had been employed by a circus, did not establish that the child would clearly be better off with the father as opposed to the mother.

        In a divorce action, the magistrate did not abuse his discretion in awarding primary physical custody of the parties’ child to the husband, because the wife demonstrated disregard for the court’s orders, she demonstrated a propensity for dishonesty, she had difficulty controlling her anger and had sometimes unreasonably prevented visitation between the father and the child, she sometimes drank to excess and used alcohol together with prescription antidepressants, and she suffered intermittently from depression.

       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting divided custody of the children in view of the mother’s plan to remove some distance from the place of the father’s employment causing the court to entertain an apprehension of estrangement of the children from the father.

        An award of the sole care, custody and education of the minor children of the parties to the plaintiff, subject to reasonable visitation rights of the husband, with a proviso that if she move outside of her husband’s residence area, he should have the custody of the children for a two-month period during the school vacation, was not an abuse of discretion.

       <p>
        Where the court found each of the parties to be a fit and proper person to be awarded the care, custody and control of the children, the best interests of the children would not be adversely affected by permitting the children, whose custody was awarded to the mother, to visit their father for at least 60 days during the summer months. Nielsen v. Nielsen, 87 Idaho 578, 394 P.2d 625 (1964).

       <p>
        Consideration of the relationship between children and their paternal grandparents was valid since it reflected on the children’s adjustment to their home and community — factors which this section lists as factors which may be considered. Shumway v. Shumway, 106 Idaho 415, 679 P.2d 1133 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The wishes of young children should not constitute the determining factor in a decision as to custody; the magistrate did not violate this rule of law where he stated that due to the ages of the children, their wishes, while persuasive, were not considered as the dominant reason for the custody determination and were not dispositive of the issue. Shumway v. Shumway, 106 Idaho 415, 679 P.2d 1133 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother’s actions in removing her son from the state and, in the magistrate’s evaluation, holding him hostage, reflected badly on her overall integrity, as did lying about the reasons she left the state and where magistrate determined that the mother had exaggerated the degree to which the father had a violent temper in an attempt to justify her removal of the child from the state, in considering this issue, along with the factors set out in this section, the magistrate did not abuse its discretion in granting custody to mother and father with father being awarded primary residential custody. Dymitro v. Dymitro, 129 Idaho 527, 927 P.2d 917 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate judge did not err in considering a wife’s adultery in deciding whether the wife or the husband was entitled to custody of the minor children; the judge did not award the husband custody to punish the wife, nor did the judge find that the adultery rendered the wife an unfit parent, but the judge did find that the wife’s openly adulterous relationship had a negative impact on the family, which weighed in favor of the husband being awarded custody. Gustaves v. Gustaves, 138 Idaho 64, 57 P.3d 775 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate did not wrongly base his decision to award the mother sole legal and physical custody of the children based on the father’s homosexuality. There were no allegations here that the children had been harmed by the father’s homosexuality, and the magistrate judge did not rely on that factor in his custody determination. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).

       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Sexual orientation, in and of itself, cannot be the basis for awarding or removing custody. Only when the parent’s sexual orientation is shown to cause harm to the child, such that the child’s best interests are not served, should sexual orientation be a factor in determining custody.

        No clear abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court appears in modifying a decree of divorce awarding the mother custody of a child so as to award its custody during the summer vacation to the father. Smith v. Smith, 67 Idaho 349, 180 P.2d 853 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        A divorce decree granting a minor child’s custody to the mother during the school year and to the father during the summer vacation was modified to give each parent the right of visitation and of making presents to said child while in the other parent’s custody. Smith v. Smith, 67 Idaho 349, 180 P.2d 853 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where custody of children was awarded wife in divorce decree and parties later entered into an agreement wherein the wife agreed to surrender the custody to the husband, the court could not sanction such modification until an application was filed showing a material, permanent and substantial change in circumstances and condition of the parties since the date of the original decree.

        Where father under original decree of divorce was awarded custody of son and was taking care of son in an excellent manner and where mother had visited son only a few times and, if awarded custody, would take the child out of the state, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify decree on petition by mother for custody of child. Jeppson v. Jeppson, 75 Idaho 219, 270 P.2d 437 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was a marked improvement in the attitude of defendant mother of the child in regard to her responsibilities as a mother, it might be such a material permanent change in conditions as would warrant modification of the custody decree, especially where there was a finding that the physical and mental health of the child would be best protected by such change. McMurtrey v. McMurtrey, 84 Idaho 314, 372 P.2d 403 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Modification of a decree awarding custody of minor children to a parent who is a fit and proper person to have such custody, is proper where it appears that the custodial parent has contrived to prevent the other parent from seeing and visiting such children in the manner and spirit provided for in the decree and has shaken their love and affection for the other parent. Stewart v. Stewart, 86 Idaho 108, 383 P.2d 617 (1963).

       <p>
        Where, subsequent to the divorce, the father moved to California, the mother remarried, her new husband was hostile to the father, and the mother sought to restrict the father’s visit with the children to one hour the second and fourth Mondays of each month in her home, there was a change of conditions, and it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to modify the decree with respect to the father’s visitation rights with respect to the children. Dawson v. Dawson, 90 Idaho 234, 409 P.2d 434 (1965).
    Where, on a finding that the wife drank heavily, spent her evenings on late dates, and associated with her mother whom the court considered a bad influence, the divorce court awarded custody of the infant daughter of the parties to the husband, who subsequently remarried a widow with one child and who cared for the daughter, denial of the wife’s petition for change of custody on the ground that she had remarried and quit her drinking was not an abuse of discretion. Bryant v. Bryant, 92 Idaho 76, 437 P.2d 29 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of trial court changing custody of minor children of divorced parents from father to mother was abuse of discretion where father and present wife were and had been fit and proper persons to have custody; where mother and her present husband, though apparently rehabilitated, had not in the past been fit and proper persons, and might retrogress; where change was ordered partly for welfare of mother, rather than children; and where mother intended to remove children from state and court’s jurisdiction. Tomlinson v. Tomlinson, 93 Idaho 42, 454 P.2d 756 (1969).

       <p>
        Petition for modification of decree of child custody will not be granted unless petitioner shows that a material, permanent and substantial change in the circumstances and conditions of the parties has occurred since the date of the original decree and such change makes modification of the decree appear to be in the best interest of the child’s welfare. Adams v. Adams, 93 Idaho 113, 456 P.2d 757 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no evidence to support the trial court’s modification of the custody provision of the divorce decree other than the desire of the plaintiff and the fifteen-year-old daughter that custody be transferred, and where the record and pleadings showed no material, permanent or substantial change in the conditions and circumstances of either party, such change in custody was an abuse of the discretion of the trial court. Strain v. Strain, 95 Idaho 904, 523 P.2d 36 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a custody change has been requested, the court must look not only for changes of condition which are material, permanent and substantial, but also must thoroughly explore the ramifications, vis-a-vis the best interests of the child, of any change that is evident. Poesy v. Bunney, 98 Idaho 258, 561 P.2d 400 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where court found, following default divorce decree against father, that the two older children of five minor children in the custody of the mother were absent from school for a substantial amount of time despite conferences between school officials and mother, that the children did not make normal advancement with classmates and that father had remarried and was able to provide children with suitable home environment to foster improved educational achievement, this record indicated that material, permanent and substantial change of circumstances had occurred since default divorce decree and that the best interests of children would be served by awarding permanent custody to father. Overman v. Overman, 102 Idaho 235, 629 P.2d 127 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mother represented that third party had facilitated a negotiated child custody settlement and asked magistrate to enter order resolving the custody issue based on third party’s recommendations and testimony and order was entered without objection, mother was foreclosed from attacking the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that order; custody modification affirmed. Ratliff v. Ratliff, 129 Idaho 422, 925 P.2d 1121 (1996).
    Acts and conduct of the custodial parent, resulting in the alienation of the love and affection which children naturally have for the other parent, is a vital and very serious detriment to the welfare of such children and is grounds for modification of the decree with respect to such custody. McGriff v. McGriff, 140 Idaho 642, 99 P.3d 111 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the absence of a request by the parties to modify the holiday visitation schedule, the magistrate judge was within his discretion to do so. The magistrate judge properly concluded that the mother’s move constituted a material change in circumstances that required a revision of the visitation schedule to serve the best interests of the children to reduce the time they spend riding in cars. Nelson v. Nelson, 144 Idaho 710, 170 P.3d 375 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court is without authority to modify a child custody order if the movant is in contempt for nonpayment of support, unless the movant shows that, for reasons beyond the movant’s control, purging himself or herself of the contempt is impossible. Rodriguez v. Rodriguez, 150 Idaho 614, 249 P.3d 413 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Custody modification conforming to a child custody evaluator’s recommendations was proper where the children’s interactions with their mother, father, and siblings supported the custody modification; the children were over-exposed to parental conflict, primarily caused by the father, and the trial court found all the evidence showed that the father’s behavior was destabilizing to the children. Firmage v. Snow, 158 Idaho 343, 347 P.3d 191 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court abused its discretion when it altered the original custody arrangement to award the father primary physical custody of the parties’ three youngest children. The evidence was insufficient to show that the mother engaged in alienating behaviors, and the change to the summer schedule and the mother’s move to another town 30 minutes away were not material and substantial changes in circumstances that warranted a change in custody. Doe v. Doe, 161 Idaho 67, 383 P.3d 1237 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate judge erred in modifying a child custody plan, changing primary custody during the school year from the mother to the father, because, although the magistrate judge correctly found that there had been a material, permanent, and substantial change in circumstances, the changed circumstances did not warrant a change in custody for the best interests of child, as the child’s changes in schools were in the child’s best educational interests as part of the school district’s gifted and talented program. Father consented to the child’s enrollment in the program; and there was no evidence in the record that the mother’s residential moves had any impact on the child, or that the mother was doing anything contrary to the child’s best interests. Searle v. Searle, 162 Idaho 839, 405 P.3d 1180 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the material, permanent and substantial change standard to modify a custodial order is a sound legal principle, care must be exercised in its application. The court must look not only for changes of condition or circumstance which are material, permanent and substantial, but also must thoroughly explore the ramifications, vis-/Ga-vis the best interest of the child, of any change which is evident. Woods v. Woods, 163 Idaho 904, 422 P.3d 1110 (2018).

       <p>
        The district court may enter an ex parte order granting temporary custody to a noncustodial parent if the record before him indicates that such an order is necessary and is in the best interests of the children, and if the order is followed within ten days by a full hearing on the merits of the noncustodial parent’s motion. Overman v. Overman, 102 Idaho 235, 629 P.2d 127 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        If adequate justification for an ex parte order temporarily transferring custody to a noncustodial parent is shown, and if a full hearing on the question of which parent should maintain custody pending a motion to modify a custody decree is provided within ten days, no due process violation appears. Overman v. Overman, 102 Idaho 235, 629 P.2d 127 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court did not abuse its discretion by issuing an ex parte order awarding temporary custody of children to the natural father for a period not exceeding ten days pursuant to the plenary authority to this section, since the possibility existed that the mother would remove the couple’s children from the state and since the order merely shifted custody until a full hearing would be held.

        In view of the fact that the children will need the support payments decreed by the court, such payments cannot be withheld as a means of enforcing the former wife’s compliance with the court’s visitation order, but such right of visitation must be enforced by other remedies; therefore, an order authorizing clerk of court to withhold support payments upon protest by the former husband of former wife’s violation of visitation order must be stricken.

        Failure of a magistrate judge to explicitly notify mother of her rights under subsection (2) was a harmless, technical violation, as the record showed that she was on notice that the effects of any disability that she suffered from were at issue and she was provided an opportunity to present evidence on the issue of her use of medications.

        Grandparents’ appeal from an order denying them grandparent custody, under subsection (3) of this section, was moot because (1) the grandparents were appointed as their grandson’s guardians; (2) as guardians, the grandparents had custody of their grandson; (3) until the guardianship was terminated, a guardian’s right to custody of a minor was superior to that of the minor’s parent, under<cite class="id_code">§ 15-5</cite>-209; and (4) granting the grandparents custody under subsection (3) of this section would not have given them any greater rights with respect to their grandson than they already had as his guardians.

        Subsection (3) merely grants an actual custodial grandparent the same standing as a parent for evaluating what custody arrangements are in the best interests of the child in a divorce action. Hernandez v. Hernandez, 151 Idaho 882, 265 P.3d 495 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its analysis of “stable relationship” in subsection (3), a court should consider not only the time that a child resided with his grandparents, but also other factors, such as the provision of the child’s medical, educational, and mental health and other daily needs, consistency, dependability, and the overall nature of the relationship between the grandparents and the child.

       </p>
       <p>
        Since a district court has jurisdiction not only of the divorce proceedings, but continuing jurisdiction over questions involving the custody of minor children, it was acting within its jurisdiction when it found divorced wife in contempt for refusing divorced husband his child visitation rights, so that a writ of prohibition was improperly sought, improvidently issued, and was quashed.

        Court erred in entering an order preventing the mother from moving out of state, even without the child.

        After divorce proceedings, the court retains jurisdiction over minors until they reach majority in order to modify the decree to better accommodate the welfare of such children; however, a divorce decree should not be modified unless and until a permanent material change of circumstances is alleged and proven.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the child is a minor is not the sole criterion of a court’s power or jurisdiction to modify the child maintenance obligations of the original decree; rather, the fact of dependency of the child constitutes the governing criterion to be considered in imposing the obligation and thereafter in continuing, modifying or terminating such obligation.

       <p>
        Since no rule of finality exists in the determination of the right to custody of children, a district court retains continuing jurisdiction to modify the decree of custody whenever required by changed circumstances to insure the best interests and welfare of the children. Prescott v. Prescott, 97 Idaho 257, 542 P.2d 1176 (1975).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the Idaho district court was the court that filed the original divorce decree, which included a stipulation regarding custody and visitation of the children, the Idaho district court was the most appropriate forum in which to file the motion to modify the custody provisions of the original divorce decree, and the district court did not err in asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the court’s continuing jurisdiction under this section.

        Magistrate judge’s denial of a mother’s motion to relocate to another county did not constitute an abuse of discretion because the mother’s living arrangements, along with other factors outlined in this section, were relevant in determining the best interest of the children. Roberts v. Roberts, 138 Idaho 401, 64 P.3d 327 (2003).

        Magistrate court did not abuse its discretion in denying a father’s motion for primary physical custody of the children, and finding that relocation with the mother was in the best interests of the children, where the magistrate court considered the statutory and relevant non-statutory factors and properly exercised its discretion to determine the amount of custodial time each parent would have with the children.

        Generally, a party seeking modification of a custody agreement has the burden of justifying a change in custody. That burden shifts to a party wishing to relocate, however, when relocating the child would violate the previous custody arrangement. However, once the parent seeking permission to relocate proves that relocation is in the child’s best interest, he or she will be allowed to move with the child. Lamont v.

       <p>
        In custody disputes between a “nonparent” (i.e., an individual who is neither legal nor natural parent) and a natural parent, Idaho courts apply a presumption that a natural parent should have custody as opposed to other lineal or collateral relatives or interested parties. This presumption operates to preclude consideration of the best interests of the child unless the nonparent demonstrates either that the natural parent has abandoned the child, that the natural parent is unfit or that the child has been in the nonparent’s custody for an appreciable period of time.

       <p>
        The welfare of minor children of a union dissolved by divorce is of such grave importance that the court should never be satisfied in determining such matters except upon production of the best evidence possible to be procured. Affidavits are not sufficient. Cornelison v. Cornelison, 53 Idaho 266, 23 P.2d 252 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order modifying a decree for the custody and maintenance of minor children based only on conflicting affidavits was reversed with direction that witnesses be called to establish the facts relied on by the litigants and such other facts as the trial judge might deem pertinent to a decision looking to the best interests of the minor children, and that findings, conclusions and order be made accordingly. Cornelison v. Cornelison, 53 Idaho 266, 23 P.2d 252 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although parents may be unfit or unable to care for their own children, they may still have an interest in their welfare and the environment in which they are placed, and they have a right to be heard before the final award is made. Brown v. Brown, 66 Idaho 625, 165 P.2d 886 (1946), overruled on other grounds, State Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Slane, 155 Idaho 274, 311 P.3d 286 (2013).
    Court erred in excluding further evidence on grounds for divorce, where evidence might indirectly affect custody of the child. Brashear v. Brashear, 71 Idaho 158, 228 P.2d 243 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the best interests of the child the court should allow and consider all evidence relevant to a child’s interest, not just that evidence which has emerged since previous orders. Poesy v. Bunney, 98 Idaho 258, 561 P.2d 400 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where facts affecting children’s welfare and existing at the time of the divorce or order awarding custody are not called to the attention of the court, particularly in divorce cases where the issues affecting custody have not been fully tried, the court upon a proper application may consider all facts and circumstances, including those existing prior to and at the time of the judgment or decree, in making a subsequent decree of custody. Stewart v. Stewart, 86 Idaho 108, 383 P.2d 617 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence concerning use of narcotics by husband and wife prior to their separation was not too remote in time to be relevant as character evidence in a custody suit. See Milliron v. Milliron, 116 Idaho 253, 775 P.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1989).

        — Findings.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In determining a child’s custody, it is necessary that findings of fact and conclusions of law as to all relevant issues be made by the trial court and included in a record of appeal. Poesy v. Bunney, 98 Idaho 258, 561 P.2d 400 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding by the trial court that both parents are fit does not preclude the court from inquiring into each parent’s respective capabilities and their comparative fitness. Milliron v. Milliron, 116 Idaho 253, 775 P.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion in applying the factors set forth in this section where it made detailed findings on the child’s wishes, the adjustment to home, school, and community, the continuity and stability of the child, and the physical and mental health of all individuals involved, and where each relevant factor was discussed along with the pertinent conflicting evidence.

        The request “for such other and further relief as the court deems proper” in the prayer of a husband’s petition to declare back support and alimony paid in full and to enjoin the wife and her attorney from levying execution for such back support was sufficient to enable the court to modify the decree as to future payments.

        It is within the discretion of the trial judge as to whether he will personally examine minor children, involved in custody proceedings, out of the presence of their contending parents. Stewart v. Stewart, 86 Idaho 108, 383 P.2d 617 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where judge had already talked to a ten-year-old son of both parties in the presence of the counsel, but without the presence of the parents, at a preliminary hearing, there was no error in the court’s refusal to interview the boy privately in chambers, in the face of evidence that father had tried to alienate the boy from the mother. Stewart v. Stewart, 86 Idaho 108, 383 P.2d 617 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge properly ruled at time of custody hearing that a 16-year-old daughter who had testified at length as a witness for her father, the defendant, and exhibited her want of affection for her mother, was old enough to testify, in response to counsel’s suggestion that the judge interview her privately, especially since the judge offered to permit her return to the witness stand for further examination.

       <p>
        In child custody cases the court should maintain an attitude of strict impartiality between religions and should not interfere with the religious training of a child absent compelling reasons for such action. Compton v. Gilmore, 98 Idaho 190, 560 P.2d 861 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court made no affirmative showing that the parents’ conflicting religious beliefs affected the general welfare of the child, the court’s order to the father to refrain from providing formal religious training to the daughter was an abuse of discretion. Compton v. Gilmore, 98 Idaho 190, 560 P.2d 861 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court rejected the contention that, in the absence of a compelling reason, the favoring of religiousness over nonreligiousness in custody proceedings is permissible. Osteraas v. Osteraas, 124 Idaho 350, 859 P.2d 948 (1993).

        Removal of Child from State.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial court can grant permission to the custodian of a child of divorced parents to remove the child from the state, if the child’s welfare as a normal human being and future citizen requires that such permission be given. Roosma v. Moots, 62 Idaho 450, 112 P.2d 1000 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence warranted an order granting the maternal grandmother, to whom was awarded the custody of the minor child of the divorced parents, permission to take the child out of the state of Idaho and into the state of Washington, where the grandmother had purchased a home, the environment of which was conducive to the health, happiness, and proper care and training of the child. Roosma v. Moots, 62 Idaho 450, 112 P.2d 1000 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general rule, court should retain jurisdiction until decree of custody becomes final, but if best interest of child requires removal to another state, the court may grant such permission. Brashear v. Brashear, 71 Idaho 158, 228 P.2d 243 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Permission to take a minor child beyond the jurisdiction of the court should only be granted where the best interests and welfare of the child clearly require it. Larkin v. Larkin, 85 Idaho 610, 382 P.2d 784 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        A geographical relocation of minor children, such that the custody decree cannot be followed as previously entered, constitutes a substantial change of circumstances sufficient for the party seeking modification to be granted a hearing. Osteraas v. Osteraas, 124 Idaho 350, 859 P.2d 948 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in awarding custody of a child to the mother on the condition that the mother not leave Idaho; although the mother wanted to move to Oregon with the child, the trial court’s conclusion that it was in the best interests of the child to stay in Idaho had a substantial, rational basis in the facts. Weiland v. Ruppel, 139 Idaho 122, 75 P.3d 176 (2003).
    Magistrate did not abuse his discretion by denying the mother’s request to modify the custody order and move with her child to Hawaii because: (1) the magistrate considered many factors relevant to whether the custodial parent should be permitted to relocate with a child, including the mother’s motive for the move, the extent alternative visitation would allow the father and his daughter to maintain a close relationship, and the effect of the move on the daughter’s extended family; (2) the magistrate did not apply an irrebuttable presumption against the physical separation of the child and the non-custodial father; and (3) the magistrate’s findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by the evidence, including his finding that the mother interfered with the father’s relationship with the daughter and that the mother had a negative attitude toward the father. Bartosz v. Jones, 146 Idaho 449, 197 P.3d 310 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to subsection (1), because the possibility of economic, emotional, and educational enhancements favored the move and because the mother had been the most consistent and stable parent, the mother retained primary physical custody of the children after she moved from Idaho to Oregon. Markwood v. Markwood, 152 Idaho 756, 274 P.3d 1271 (Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in awarding primary physical custody of the parties’ five children to the mother, with visitation to the father, and in permitting mother to move to Utah: mother had family in Utah, the move to Utah would allow the mother to stay at home with the children while earning an income by performing secretarial work for her brother, and mother planned on residing with her father. Peterson v. Peterson, 153 Idaho 318, 281 P.3d 1096 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s decision permitting a mother to move out of state with the parties’ two children was affirmed: an explanation for rejecting the father’s expert testimony was not required, any error in allowing the mother’s expert to testify via Skype was harmless, and consideration that the move allowed the mother to be a stay-at-home parent was not improper.

       </p>
       <p>
        Judgments affecting the custody, support and education of children, like other judgments, are conclusive upon the parties privies and the doctrine of res judicata is applicable thereto. However, this is not to be applied strictly in all determinations affecting the welfare of children of divorced parents. Stewart v. Stewart, 86 Idaho 108, 383 P.2d 617 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The doctrines of estoppel by judgment and res judicata do not apply in an action to modify a decree of divorce where the specific issue is that of child support. Alber v. Alber, 93 Idaho 755, 472 P.2d 321 (1970).

        Where former wife was granted a judgment modifying divorce decree by awarding custody of two children to her as a result of material change in conditions, including her remarriage, which warranted transfer of custody to her, the supreme court was not bound by principles of res judicata and thus appropriately granted the former husband’s motion to supplement the appeal record and thus took judicial notice of former wife’s divorce subsequent to trial court proceedings. England v. Phillips, 96 Idaho 830, 537 P.2d 1019 (1975). Separation Agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court had jurisdiction to hear wife’s actions for child support after the child reached majority and for alimony where there was clear and convincing evidence that the parties in a separation agreement intended that the agreement be integrated and not be merged into the decree of divorce, and any presumptions to the contrary were rebutted.

        It is clearly established under Idaho precedent, that where a child has been in the custody of a third party for an appreciable period of time (and thereby developed a bond with that person), the custody of the child will be awarded to that party if the best interests of the child so dictate; in this circumstance, neither “a mandatory showing of abandonment nor of patent unfitness” is necessary to overcome a natural parent’s right.

        Trial court erred in disregarding the presumption for joint custody and determining that mother’s greater relationship with child indicated that giving her sole legal and physical custody would be in the child’s best interests, where her greater relationship was primarily due to her illegal actions of absconding with the child to another state and obtaining a false domestic violence protection order there.

        Idaho favors the active participation of both parents in raising children after divorce, which policy is reflected in this section, supporting joint custody. However, the magistrate court has no authority to order a parent to reside in any particular geographical location. Allbright v. Allbright, 147 Idaho 752, 215 P.3d 472 (2009).

       <p>
        The magistrate took into account the conditions that existed in 1984, which led to the “temporary” ex parte order granting physical custody of the children to father, and the conditions subsequent to that time and up to the 1987 hearing date, and properly placed the burden of proving changed circumstances on father who did not produce sufficient evidence of a change of circumstances warranting a modification of custody. Mills v. Mills, 120 Idaho 635, 818 P.2d 339 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no abuse of discretion in determining that the child would live primarily with her father during the school year after determining that he would do better in fostering a strong parental bond with both parents. State v. Hart, 142 Idaho 721, 132 P.3d 1249 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence showed that the parents had proven incapable of making joint decisions about school enrollment, and each had changed the children’s school enrollment without consulting the other. Magistrate’s decision, which limited the mother’s unilateral authority solely to choosing the children’s schools and continued joint legal custody with respect to all other questions concerning the children’s education, health and general welfare, was not an abuse of discretion. Silva v. Silva, 142 Idaho 900, 136 P.3d 371 (Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        After the husband pleaded guilty to domestic battery, his wife left Idaho and fled to Oregon with their minor child. Magistrate court abused its discretion by ordering the wife to return with their child to Boise or surrender child custody. It was error for the magistrate court to fail to make findings on the wife’s argument that the husband’s habitual domestic violence overcame the presumption that joint custody was in the child’s best interest. Schultz v. Schultz, 145 Idaho 859, 187 P.3d 1234 (2008).
    In ruling on a mother’s request to move with her child to Hawaii, a magistrate needs to consider this section’s presumption in favor of joint custody and frequent and continuing contact between both parents and the child, as well as all of the factors listed in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-717" target="_self">§ 32-717</a></cite>. However, the presumption is not irrebutable. Bartosz v. Jones, 146 Idaho 449, 197 P.3d 310 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate and the district court erred by “redefining” joint custody and awarding sole legal custody to a mother, where neither party filed a petition for modification, was on notice that custody, as a general matter, was being disputed, or had an opportunity to present evidence and arguments appropriate to a custody modification dispute. Mahnami v. Mahnami, 156 Idaho 338, 325 P.3d 679 (Ct. App. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where the mother granted her consent to her 17-year-old child’s marriage, but the father did not, the district court erred in affirming the magistrate’s judgment holding the mother in contempt for violating the order modifying custody, because the order did not clearly and unequivocally prohibit the mother from consenting to the child’s marriage. Thompson v. Bybee, 161 Idaho 158, 384 P.3d 405 (Ct. App. 2016).

        Custody modification conforming to a child custody evaluator’s recommendations was proper where it weighed the evidence in the evaluation as it applied to the pertinent statutory factors; when the mother and father agreed to resolve custody in accordance with the evaluator’s recommendations, they agreed to allow his evaluation to be the only evidence the trial court considered in making its decision as to the children’s best interests.

       <p>
        Award of sole physical custody of two children to the mother was proper where she had served as the children’s primary caregiver their entire lives, she was best able to meet their physical and psychological needs consistently, and the father inappropriately involved the children in his conflict with the mother. Because an award of sole physical custody to the mother was in the children’s best interests, the joint custody presumption was overcome and the custody award was not an abuse of discretion. Danti v. Danti, 146 Idaho 929, 204 P.3d 1140 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody modification proceeding, the trial court did not err in concluding that granting the father sole legal and primary physical custody of the parties’ son was in the son’s best interest because the mother’s conduct was directly affecting the son’s relationship with the father; the trial court had evidence of the mother’s three and one-half years of intransigence.

        While “joint legal custody” and “primary physical custody” are not inconsistent, the determination to award primary physical custody to one parent instead of joint physical custody to both parents requires a statement of reasons therefor under subsection (1) of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate’s finding that the father was not a habitual perpetrator of domestic violence was supported by substantial and competent evidence as the incidents of violence initiated by the father resulted from his mental illness, which was later controlled by medication and counseling.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s determination that it was in the best interest of a child to reside primarily in Idaho was not an abuse of discretion; the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community favored shared custody in Idaho, a move to Nevada with the child’s mother would not have had a positive effect on the child’s relationship with the child’s father, and custody in Idaho promoted more continuity and stability in the child’s life.

        Although the parenting coordinator acted without any specific authority in making recommendations and decisions regarding the parties’ custody issues, the coordinator has the general authority to take actions that empower the parties to engage in effective parenting; on remand, the district court had to determine the coordinator’s reimbursement rate, based on which of his actions fell within that general grant of authority.

       <p>
        Even though a 2008 opinion from the Idaho court of appeals stated that the plain language of this statute limited a parenting coordinator’s powers to those granted in a magistrate’s appointment order, this conflicted with a decision from the Idaho supreme court, which had to be followed. A coordinator’s actions fall within the general powers granted by this section and former Idaho R. Civ. P. 16(l)(1) (now Idaho R. Fam. L. P. 716) since there was no modification of a judgment, and the use of the word “order” was tempered by the use of the word “recommendation.” Hausladen v. Knoche, 159 Idaho 359, 360 P.3d 367 (Ct.

A supervised access provider who is paid for providing supervised access services shall, prior to acting in such capacity and at his or her own cost, submit to a fingerprint-based criminal history check through any law enforcement office in the state providing such service. The criminal history check shall include a statewide criminal identification bureau check, federal bureau of investigation criminal history check, child abuse registry check, adult protection registry check and statewide sex offender registry check.

In reviewing an exercise of discretion, an appellate court must consider (1) whether the trial court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the trial court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it; and (3) whether the trial court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.

        Statutes of this state with reference to contracts, powers and liabilities of married women must be construed as grants instead of restrictions of power and authority to contract. Bank of Commerce, Ltd. v. Baldwin, 12 Idaho 202, 85 P. 497 (1906), overruled on other grounds, Williams v. Paxton, 98 Idaho 155, 559 P.2d 1123 (1976).

        Provisions of this chapter, concerning rights of married women, are in the nature of a grant, or an enlargement of the powers of wife to make contracts, as such rights existed at common law. Hall v. Johns, 17 Idaho 224, 105 P. 71 (1909), overruled on other grounds, Williams v. Paxton, 98 Idaho 155, 559 P.2d 1123 (1976). Criminal Conversation.

        Divorce is the exclusive remedy for a breach of any duty imposed by this section; therefore, wife’s argument that her civil tort claims were not available to recompense her for her husband’s adultery was rejected. Neal v. Neal, 125 Idaho 617, 873 P.2d 871 (1994).

        Fact that debt was contracted by wife and credit was extended on faith of her promise to pay does not relieve husband of the liability imposed on by him by operation of law, independent of wife’s contractual liability to pay. Edminston v. Smith, 13 Idaho 645, 92 P. 842 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        Primary duty rests on husband by reason of his marital contract and operation of law to furnish wife with the necessaries of life, which includes board and lodging, and creditor who furnished wife with such necessaries may maintain his action against husband, although latter never contracted debt, nor promised to pay bill. Edminston v. Smith, 13 Idaho 645, 92 P. 842 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of husband to support wife is an obligation imposed upon him by the common law as well as by this section, but wife may, by contract, waive her right to support, and a separation agreement so providing is valid. Beard v. Beard, 53 Idaho 440, 24 P.2d 47 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The duty of a husband to support the wife and the minor children, the issue of the marriage, is a continuing one and has been accorded the dignity of a statutory obligation. Linton v. Linton, 78 Idaho 355, 303 P.2d 905 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the duty of husband to maintain and support his wife and family. Hall v. Johns, 17 Idaho 224, 105 P. 71 (1909), overruled on other grounds, Williams v. Paxton, 98 Idaho 155, 559 P.2d 1123 (1976).

        Conveyance of county property to county commissioner’s wife is absolutely void even though she purchases with her separate funds or with community funds. Clark v. Utah Constr. Co., 51 Idaho 587, 8 P.2d 454 (1932).

        With defendant unable to pay for an attorney from his separate or community assets, his wife’s duty of support under this section, required that she pay, to the extent that she was financially able, for defendant’s legal defense. State v. Suiter, 138 Idaho 662, 67 P.3d 1274 (Ct. App. 2003). Separate Maintenance.

        Suit for separate maintenance may be maintained by wife under this section. Simonton v. Simonton, 33 Idaho 255, 193 P. 386 (1920); Walker v. Manson, 49 Idaho 468, 289 P. 86 (1930).

        Courts of equity have inherent jurisdiction to award separate maintenance for the support of the wife and minor children independent of any action for divorce and independent of any statutory provision.

        It was not the intent of the motor vehicle act that the issuance of certificate of title for an automobile to the wife would conclusively establish the title in her as separate property.

        When separate and community property are commingled so that tracing is impossible, it is presumed to be community property, and the burden is on the person asserting the separate character of the property; when direct tracing is impossible, the party may employ indirect evidence in the form of an accounting. Martsch v. Martsch, 103 Idaho 142, 645 P.2d 882 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court traced the assets in each of the husband’s bank accounts to the separate property of the husband acquired before marriage, and there was no community income from the separate property, there was no commingling of the funds and the property remained husband’s separate property; the assets purchased with these funds were also his separate property. Martsch v. Martsch, 103 Idaho 142, 645 P.2d 882 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, although the record indicated that husband’s deposit to money market account came from his savings account, he failed to present particular and certain evidence which traced his deposit to his separate funds contained in the account, and husband’s separate property in the money market account was mingled with wife’s separate funds, the district court correctly classified the money market account as community property.

        Community Enhancement of Separate Property.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The natural increase in value of a spouse’s separate property during the marriage generally is not community property; however, when community efforts, labor, industry, or funds enhance the value of separate property, such enhancement is community property for which the community is entitled to reimbursement. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure of the reimbursement for community expenditures on separate property is the increase in value of the property attributable thereto, not the amount or value of the community contribution; the party seeking such reimbursement to the community carries the burden of demonstrating that the community expenditures have enhanced the value of the separate property, and the amount of the enhancement. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).
    Where enhancement of the value of a separate property asset is not attributable to community effort or to rents and profits of the asset, it is separate property. Eliasen v. Fitzgerald, 105 Idaho 234, 668 P.2d 110 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        When separate property is enhanced by community efforts, labor, industry, or funds, the community is entitled to reimbursement for such enhancement. Suchan v. Suchan, 106 Idaho 654, 682 P.2d 607 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        When community labor or funds enhance the value of separate property, the amount of the enhancement is community property for which the community is entitled to reimbursement; the measure of reimbursement is the increase in value of the property attributable to the community contribution, not the amount or value of the community contribution. The party seeking reimbursement to the community carries the burden of proving that the community expenditures have enhanced the value of the separate property, and the amount of the enhancement. Sherry v. Sherry, 108 Idaho 645, 701 P.2d 265 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a husband uses community property to improve his wife’s separate estate, a gift of his community share is no longer presumed; therefore, the community should have been compensated for its payment of income taxes on the wife’s share of reported partnership earnings which were her separate property, if the payments of income taxes were intended as a gift of husband’s community share to the wife’s separate estate. Brazier v. Brazier, 111 Idaho 692, 726 P.2d 1143 (Ct. App. 1986), overruled on other grounds, Swope v. Swope, 112 Idaho 974, 739 P.2d 273 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the magistrate’s decision to deny reimbursement to the community for alleged enhancements to the husband’s separate property due to expenditures of community funds and labor was supported by substantial competent evidence, because some of the alleged improvements were made before the marriage, and the wife failed to demonstrate that the community expenditures enhanced the value of the husband’s separate property and the amount of the enhancement. Hoskinson v. Hoskinson, 139 Idaho 448, 80 P.3d 1049 (2003).

        Where the original contract purchaser of a ranch, who defaulted on contract subsequent to divorce which was later set aside for fraud, married the new purchaser of the ranch and cohabited with her with knowledge of the illicit status of his purported marriage and without furnishing any funds for payments on her contract of purchase, said husband acquired no interest in second ranch for which second wife had traded her interest in first ranch by such purported marriage and cohabitation and the ranch was not community property.

        Where parents transferred to their son the deed to a farm in return for an annuity contract which was of less value than the property, and where the differential was declared by the parents to be a gift to the son, the son had a separate property interest in the farm equivalent to the excess of the fair market value of the farm over that of the contract and the remainder of the farm was the community property of the son and his wife.

        Where the evidence indicated no increase in the size of cattle herd during marriage, but rather indicated that the cattle herd had diminished to practically nothing at the death of the decedent husband, the trial court properly determined that there was no community income from the herd, with the possible exception of interest accrued on moneys received from the sale, which moneys were more than exhausted by community expenses. Eliasen v. Fitzgerald, 105 Idaho 234, 668 P.2d 110 (1983).
    Where down payment on house was made by husband from his separate funds, but house was deeded to both husband and wife, and they each signed on the promissory note and deed of trust and, in case of default, the lender’s first option would be to foreclose the mortgage on the house, the facts generated a strong inference that the character of the property was community and, in the absence of any relevant evidence to the contrary, the district court correctly found the house to be community property. The payments made on the community obligation from husband’s separate funds were subject to reimbursement to him in the absence of a finding that such contributions were intended as a gift to the community.

        A deed granting property to only one spouse shows the acquisition of property during marriage, and, without more, the presumption that the property is community applies; the separate character of the property can be established by tracing the source of the funds used to acquire the property to the separate property of the spouse named in the deed, or by showing that the property was acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fundamental concept of community property law is that all property acquired by either spouse during the marriage is rebuttably presumed to be community property; however, the presumption of community property may be rebutted by showing that the property was received as a gift by one of the spouses, because property acquired by gift is separate property. Shumway v. Shumway, 106 Idaho 415, 679 P.2d 1133 (1984).

The creditor obtained a judgment against the debtor’s former husband after he failed to repay a debt, this section created a presumption that the property was community property at the time the creditor filed its lien, the lien attached to the debtor’s community property interest, and the lien impaired the debtor’s homestead exemption. In re Ashcraft, 415 B.R. 428 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Property acquired during a marriage is presumed to be community property. The presumption can be overcome if the party asserting the separate character of the property carries his burden of proving, with reasonable certainty and particularity, that the property acquired during marriage is separate property. Kraly v. Kraly, 147 Idaho 299, 208 P.3d 281 (2009).

        Where evidence supported husband’s contention that the entire purchase price of an acquired property was paid with his separate funds from the sale of his pre-marital separate home in Florida and the trial court did not find that husband gifted any part of the property to wife, the court properly held that the property was husband’s separate property.

        Where the law of the state of marital domicile at the time the parties acquired securities and bank accounts characterized such property as “separate” but recognized the right of a spouse at the time of divorce to share in the distribution of such property, the trial court in a divorce action was in error in applying this section to the securities and bank accounts which, if acquired jointly by the parties while domiciled in this state, would have been deemed community property and subject to division upon a divorce.

        Retirement Benefits.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Military retirement benefits are classified as community or separate property according to whether the active service upon which the benefits are based took place prior to marriage or after marriage. Thus, in keeping with general community property principles, military retirement benefits are community property to the extent that they were earned during the marriage; conversely, military retirement benefits are separate property to the extent they were earned prior to the marriage. Griggs v. Griggs, 107 Idaho 123, 686 P.2d 68 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband’s military service took place entirely before the marriage, his entire retirement pay would be classified as separate property. Lang v. Lang, 109 Idaho 802, 711 P.2d 1322 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by a wife, six years after her divorce, for a redetermination of community property interest in husband’s pension benefits, in which wife was awarded one-half of the pension benefits, valued at the time of actual retirement, that award included increases in pension benefits which accrued after the date of divorce, and hence not acquired during marriage, but during the time the husband was an unmarried person and, as such, those increases constituted the separate property of the husband, and to the extent that an interest in those post-divorce increases was awarded to the wife, it constituted an impermissible invasion of husband’s separate property. Shill v. Shill, 115 Idaho 115, 765 P.2d 140 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband’s first eligible retirement date was six months after his divorce and his actual retirement date was four years later, the determination of, and the valuation of, the pension benefits should have occurred at the date of the decree of divorce; however, where such valuation and an award of a lump sum to the wife was not made and appeared to be impossible six years later in an action for redetermination of community interests, the court ruled that an award was necessary based upon the monthly sum which would have been received if the husband had taken retirement at his first eligibility. Shill v. Shill, 115 Idaho 115, 765 P.2d 140 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A qualified domestic relations order is a present separation of future retirement benefits and, under certain circumstances, may be preferable over a cash distribution because it does not place an undue financial strain on either party; but where husband was prepared to make a lump sum payment to wife the magistrate should have included a provision in the qualified domestic relations order that would have given him the option to make a lump sum payment to her within 60 days after judgment was entered representing the present value of her interest in the fixed benefit plan benefits. Maslen v. Maslen, 121 Idaho 85, 822 P.2d 982 (1991).
    Although the “time rule” method of valuation of the community interest in pension plans could be employed, by calculating community interest in a retirement fund using a ratio of the duration of the marriage with the years of service, it has never been adopted nor held that the “time rule” is the only acceptable method. Maslen v. Maslen, 121 Idaho 85, 822 P.2d 982 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence presented to the magistrate, which related to the value of the pension benefits, was in the form of account statements showing the contributions made during the marriage and the account balance at the time of marriage and at the time of divorce; any contributions, increases or earnings in the account which occurred prior to the marriage are separate property under this section, and that portion of the account was reflected in the account balance at the time of marriage; therefore, by subtracting the account balance at the time of marriage from the account balance at the time of divorce, the portion of the contributions and the increases in the account which were acquired during the marriage are identified and there is a rebuttable presumption that all property acquired during marriage — in this case, contributions and increases in the account — is community property. Maslen v. Maslen, 121 Idaho 85, 822 P.2d 982 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal law which authorizes and regulates individual retirement accounts does not preempt Idaho community property law which would characterize individual retirement accounts which were purchased with community funds as community property.

       </p>
       <p>
        Retirement account and personal property were wife’s separate property, where husband and wife never withdrew any funds from the retirement account, husband never contributed to account, and wife purchased personal property with money she inherited. McCoy v. McCoy, 125 Idaho 199, 868 P.2d 527 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because wife in divorce action was awarded a sum equal to her interest in the military retirement benefits of her husband to be paid in installments, she was entitled to interest accrued at the rate used to discount the retirement benefits to their present value. Balderson v. Balderson, 127 Idaho 48, 896 P.2d 956 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 865, 116 S. Ct. 179, 133 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amount in a wife’s retirement account at the time of marriage was her separate property; however, the husband’s retirement account, though valued less than it was at the time of the marriage, was properly characterized as community property, as he had commingled both separate and community funds in it and he had transferred money out of it to fund his business ventures. Baruch v. Clark, 154 Idaho 732, 302 P.3d 357 (2013).

        Whenever one party to a marriage claims that he or she is entitled to share in the increase in value of a separate property business in which one of the parties was an employee during the marriage, the proper inquiry upon dissolution of the marriage is whether the community has been adequately compensated for its labor, and in determining adequate compensation, a three-pronged analysis is called for; first, business factors such as, inter alia, type, size and growth pattern should be considered; second, once the business factors have been considered, the question is whether the overall compensation received by the community was equivalent to the compensation that would have been necessary to secure a non-owner employee to perform the same services the community rendered; and third, if it is found that the community has been under-compensated, the community is then entitled to a judgment against the owner-spouse equivalent to the deficiency found. If, however, no deficiency is found, the community has no claim. Wolford v. Wolford, 117 Idaho 61, 785 P.2d 625 (1990). Vested Disability Benefits.

       <p>
        Where property, or the right to receive property, is acquired during marriage as compensation for some right personal to one spouse alone, that property takes its character from the right violated and is the separate property of the injured spouse; accordingly, the right to workers’ compensation payments received because of work-related injuries suffered by one spouse during the marriage is the separate property of that spouse and not the community property of the couple after a divorce.

       </p>
       <p>
        The word “acquired” should not be read over broadly to require that every award of workers’ compensation be deemed community property in total simply because the injury upon which the benefits are premised occurred during marriage. Cook v. Cook, 102 Idaho 651, 637 P.2d 799 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although workers’ compensation benefits are presumed to be community property when acquired during marriage, once the marriage is terminated it becomes evident that the marital community’s interest in a workers’ compensation award is limited, and benefits beyond an amount attributable to lost earning power during the marriage constitute the separate property of the injured spouse.

Jaeckel v. Pease, 6 Idaho 131, 53 P. 399 (1898). But see Williams v. Paxton, 98 Idaho 155, 559 P.2d 1123 (1976).

       <p>
        Where wife joins her husband in warranty deed conveying his separate property, and for conveyance of which husband receives the consideration, wife is not liable in any action for breach of covenant of warranty, for reason that such contract and covenant of warranty is not made with reference to wife’s separate property or for her own use or benefit. Humbird Lumber Co. v. Doran, 24 Idaho 507, 135 P. 66 (1913). But see Williams v. Paxton, 98 Idaho 155, 559 P.2d 1123 (1976).

        The court concluded that defendant made the transaction to purchase 50 per cent of the cab stock in her own right, she dealing with the sellers sui juris, knowing her husband had no property or credit and that the community had no property or credit, therefore the obligation represented by the note was her individual and separate obligation and her separate property was liable for the payment thereof. Frost v. Mead, 86 Idaho 155, 383 P.2d 834 (1963), overruled on other grounds, Williams v. Paxton, 98 Idaho 155, 559 P.2d 1123 (1976).

        Debtor’s motion seeking turnover of prorated portion of her federal tax refund was denied. Because the refund was community property subject to equal management by either spouse, all of the prorated tax refund constituted property of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate and was available to satisfy creditors’ claims incurred by the debtor before her marriage.

        Because a debtor and his wife purchased a vehicle during their marriage, it was presumed to be community property under this section, and they did not rebut this presumption by testifying that the vehicle was purchased with funds from the wife’s separate bank account. A Chapter 7 trustee could avoid a transfer of the vehicle from debtor to his wife, as constructively fraudulent under 11 U.S.C.S. § 548(a)(1)(B),<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c09s55-914" target="_blank">§ 55-914</a></cite>(1), and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c09s55-913" target="_blank">§ 55-913</a></cite>(1)(b), as the transfer occurred within the applicable reach back period, the debtor was insolvent at the time, and he transferred the vehicle for less than reasonably equivalent value.

       <p>
        When separate and community property are commingled so that tracing is impossible, it is presumed to be community property, and the burden is on the person asserting the separate character of the property; when direct tracing is impossible, the party may employ indirect evidence in the form of an accounting. Martsch v. Martsch, 103 Idaho 142, 645 P.2d 882 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court traced the assets in each of the husband’s bank accounts to the separate property of husband acquired before marriage, and there was no community income from the separate property, there was no commingling of the funds and the property remained husband’s separate property; the assets purchased with these funds were also his separate property. Martsch v. Martsch, 103 Idaho 142, 645 P.2d 882 (1982).
    Where husband failed to accurately trace the sale proceeds, which were commingled in a joint checking account, the magistrate court did not err in presuming that proceeds from the sale of husband’s business were community property, as the business was started during the marriage with clients who were acquired during the marriage.

       <p>
        When a husband uses community property to improve his wife’s separate estate, a gift of his community share is no longer presumed; therefore, the community should have been compensated for its payment of income taxes on the wife’s share of reported partnership earnings which were her separate property, if the payments of income taxes were intended as a gift of husband’s community share to the wife’s separate estate. Brazier v. Brazier, 111 Idaho 692, 726 P.2d 1143 (Ct. App. 1986), overruled on other grounds, Swope v. Swope, 112 Idaho 974, 739 P.2d 273 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the magistrate’s decision to deny reimbursement to the community for alleged enhancements to the husband’s separate property due to expenditures of community funds and labor was supported by substantial competent evidence, because some of the alleged improvements were made before the marriage, and the wife failed to demonstrate that the community expenditures enhanced the value of the husband’s separate property and the amount of the enhancement. Hoskinson v. Hoskinson, 139 Idaho 448, 80 P.3d 1049 (2003).

        Community was entitled to reimbursement for the funds expended towards the property taxes on the husband’s separate property home, because the value of the home was enhanced by those payments. Papin v. Papin, — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1092 (2019).

       <p>
        Whenever one party to a marriage claims that he or she is entitled to share in the increase in value of a separate property business in which one of the parties was an employee during the marriage, the proper inquiry upon dissolution of the marriage is whether the community has been adequately compensated for its labor. In determining adequate compensation, a three-pronged analysis is called for; first, business factors such as, inter alia, type, size and growth pattern should be considered; second, once the business factors have been considered, the question is whether the overall compensation received by the community was equivalent to the compensation that would have been necessary to secure a non-owner employee to perform the same services the community rendered; and third, if it is found that the community has been under-compensated, the community is then entitled to a judgment against the owner-spouse equivalent to the deficiency found. If, however, no deficiency is found, the community has no claim. Wolford v. Wolford, 117 Idaho 61, 785 P.2d 625 (1990).

        Property acquired by husband subsequent to the first divorce from, and prior to second marriage to, the same woman, was his sole and separate property; a gift to the woman of an undivided one-half interest in the same property which was also made between the divorce and remarriage became wife’s sole and separate property, which interest she later conveyed to a corporation. Martsch v. Martsch, 103 Idaho 142, 645 P.2d 882 (1982).
    Wife, having offered a document in an attempt to prove that its contents transmitted certain property from separate status to community property status, failed to sustain her burden of proving a transmutation, and also failed to demonstrate that the formalities required in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-917" target="_self">§§ 32-917 </a></cite>through 32-919 had been followed.

        Where a debtor and his wife purchased a motorcycle prior to their marriage, it was not community property under this section; so when the debtor transferred his interest in the motorcycle to his wife after their marriage, it was her separate property from that time forward under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-903" target="_self">§ 32-903</a></cite>. Because the motorcycle became her separate property at that time, the debtor did not transfer an interest in the motorcycle to his wife within the applicable reach back period in 11 U.S.C.S. § 548(a) or in the four-year period provided in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c09s55-918" target="_blank">§ 55-918</a></cite>, as applicable to the fraudulent transfer provisions in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c09s55-913" target="_blank">§§ 55-913</a></cite>(1)(a), (1)(b) and 55-914(a).

       <p>
        Husband asserted that the parties never established the requisite “marital community” to which benefits and detriments would accrue, demonstrated by the brevity of the marriage and the fact that it was troubled from its onset, but it is within the discretion of the trial court to determine whether there were any compelling reasons that would justify a division of the community property that is not substantially equal and the magistrate’s findings and conclusion reveal that the magistrate 1) understood that the division of the community was within the magistrate’s discretion, 2) acted within the outer boundaries of the discretion and consistent with the legal standards provided in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c07s32-712" target="_self">§ 32-712</a></cite>(1), and 3) reached the decision by an exercise of reason; therefore, there was no abuse of discretion in dividing the community.

        Risk payment theory is the appropriate method for determining the character of term life insurance policy proceeds.

        Where there was substantial competent evidence to support the magistrate’s finding that husband’s separate ranching operations sustained net operating losses during the marriage, the pasturage value of husband’s separate ranches did not constitute separate income from his separate property, and therefore did not constitute community property, but was husband’s separate property.

        Where the evidence indicated no increase in the size of cattle herd during marriage, but rather in fact indicated that the cattle herd had diminished to practically nothing at the death of the decedent husband, the trial court properly determined that there was no community income from the herd, with the possible exception of interest accrued on moneys received from the sale, which moneys were more than exhausted by community expenses.

        The rule governing the expenditure of community funds on separate property is that the natural increase in the value of a spouse’s separate property during the marriage is generally not community property; however, when community efforts, labor, industry, or funds enhance the value of separate property, such enhancement is community property for which the community is entitled to reimbursement.

       <p>
        Military retirement benefits are classified as community or separate property according to whether the active service upon which the benefits are based took place prior to marriage or after marriage. Thus, in keeping with general community property principles, military retirement benefits are community property to the extent that they were earned during the marriage; conversely, military retirement benefits are separate property to the extent they were earned prior to the marriage. Griggs v. Griggs, 107 Idaho 123, 686 P.2d 68 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A pension fund that is a form of deferred compensation is a community property asset to the extent the fund is acquired during coverture; thus, because the wife’s interest in the pension was earned during the marriage, the entire value of the pension was a community asset. Sherry v. Sherry, 108 Idaho 645, 701 P.2d 265 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband’s first eligible retirement date was six months after his divorce and his actual retirement date was four years later, the determination of, and the valuation of, the pension benefits should have occurred at the date of the decree of divorce; however, where such valuation and an award of a lump sum to the wife was not made and appeared to be impossible six years later in an action for redetermination of community interests, the court ruled that an award was necessary based upon the monthly sum which would have been received if the husband had taken retirement at his first eligibility. Shill v. Shill, 115 Idaho 115, 765 P.2d 140 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by wife, six years after her divorce, for a redetermination of community property interest in husband’s pension benefits, in which wife was awarded one-half of the pension benefits, valued at the time of actual retirement, that award included increases in pension benefits which accrued after the date of divorce, and hence not acquired during marriage, but during the time the husband was an unmarried person. As such, those increases constituted the separate property of the husband, and to the extent that an interest in those post-divorce increases was awarded to the wife, it constituted an impermissible invasion of husband’s separate property. Shill v. Shill, 115 Idaho 115, 765 P.2d 140 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A qualified domestic relations order is a present separation of future retirement benefits and, under certain circumstances, may be preferable over a cash distribution because it does not place an undue financial strain on either party; but where husband was prepared to make a lump sum payment to wife the magistrate should have included a provision in the qualified domestic relations order that would have given him the option to make a lump sum payment to her within 60 days after judgment was entered representing the present value of her interest in the fixed benefit plan benefits. Maslen v. Maslen, 121 Idaho 85, 822 P.2d 982 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the “time rule” method of valuation of the community interest in pension plans could be employed, by calculating community interest in a retirement fund using a ratio of the duration of the marriage with the years of service, it has never been adopted nor held that the “time rule” is the only acceptable method. Maslen v. Maslen, 121 Idaho 85, 822 P.2d 982 (1991).
    The evidence presented to the magistrate, which related to the value of the pension benefits, was in the form of account statements showing the contributions made during the marriage and the account balance at the time of marriage and at the time of divorce; any contributions, increases or earnings in the account which occurred prior to the marriage are separate property under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-903" target="_self">§ 32-903</a></cite>, and that portion of the account was reflected in the account balance at the time of marriage; therefore, by subtracting the account balance at the time of marriage from the account balance at the time of divorce, the portion of the contributions and the increases in the account which were acquired during the marriage are identified and there is a rebuttable presumption that all property acquired during marriage — in this case, contributions and increases in the account — is community property.

        Because wife in divorce action was awarded a sum equal to her interest in the military retirement benefits of her husband to be paid in installments, she was entitled to interest accrued at the rate used to discount the retirement benefits to their present value.

        Amount in a wife’s retirement account at the time of marriage was her separate property; however, the husband’s retirement account, though valued less than it was at the time of the marriage, was properly characterized as community property, as he had commingled both separate and community funds in it and he had transferred money out of it to fund his business ventures.

    Where defendant wife’s father had transferred to her certain stocks and moneys to enable her to care for her mother, the transfer indicating that she was to act as trustee, when she dealt with these stocks as her own, leading her husband to believe that the stocks or a major portion thereof were her own property, the dividends from such stocks were community property. Jolley v. Jolley, 83 Idaho 433, 363 P.2d 1020 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not the intent of the motor vehicle act that the issuance of certificate of title to an automobile to the wife would conclusively establish the title in her as separate property especially where there was no gift or other transfer by the husband to her of the automobile and it had been purchased with community funds; it became community property. Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Wendler, 84 Idaho 114, 368 P.2d 933 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The income of husband during three-year separation was income that met the terms of this section and became community property regardless of its status as income from his separate property or from the community property over which he exercised the use and control during the separation; accordingly, the district court was correct in including as community property farm machinery and trucking equipment, which remained in husband’s control, with their valuation fixed as of the time of the trial rather than at time of separation. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The explicit language of this section requires that the earnings of husband after separation be included as community property since a marriage continues, despite a separation, until a decree of divorce. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The natural increase in value of a spouse’s separate property during the marriage generally is not community property; however, when community efforts, labor, industry, or funds enhance the value of separate property, such enhancement is community property for which the community is entitled to reimbursement. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure of the reimbursement for community expenditures on separate property is the increase in value of the property attributable thereto, not the amount or value of the community contribution; the party seeking such reimbursement to the community carries the burden of demonstrating that the community expenditures have enhanced the value of the separate property, and the amount of the enhancement. Suter v. Suter, 97 Idaho 461, 546 P.2d 1169 (1976).

        Where, under the terms of his employer-financed group term disability insurance policy, the husband received benefits which were paid as partial consideration for past employment, and he was married during the last three years that he was able to work, the disability benefits were community property.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where parents gave their son the deed to a farm in return for an annuity contract which was of less value and declared that the difference in value was a gift to the son, the son had a separate property interest in the farm equivalent to that value differential and the remainder of the farm was community property of the son and his wife.

    In suit against legal but separated wife of deceased husband by other party with whom he had been living, separated wife was legal heir and other party was not de facto or common law wife and was not entitled to proceeds of estate. In re Reichert, 95 Idaho 647, 516 P.2d 704 (1973).

        In computing the amount of net community income available for division between the spouses in a divorce proceeding, where there were no tax returns for the first four months of marriage, it was not error for the court to compute the amount of income for the first four months by taking one third of the husband’s yearly income. Houska v. Houska, 97 Idaho 316, 543 P.2d 869 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In computing the amount of net community income available for division between the spouses in a divorce proceeding, the court was justified in relying on income tax returns as the measure of income rather than comparing the beginning and the ending net worth of assets. Houska v. Houska, 97 Idaho 316, 543 P.2d 869 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce proceeding where the parties stipulated that only the income and expenses through the year 1969 need be considered by the court in computing the net community income available for division, the court did not err in failing to consider a loss sustained by the husband in 1970.

        Although defendant-husband fireman could not draw his pension, until he completed 20 years of service, the pension was not earned on the last day of the twentieth year of employment, but was a form of deferred compensation attributable to the entire period in which it accumulated, and the portion of pension rights earned during marriage constituted a contingent community property interest subject to consideration and division upon divorce.

       <p>
        All property acquired by either spouse during coverture is presumed to be community property.

Bunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Co., 3 Idaho 126, 28 P. 396 (1891); Vermont Loan & Trust Co. v. McGregor, 5 Idaho 510, 51 P. 104 (1897); Stowell v.

       <p>
        Where contract for purchase of realty named both husband and wife, and there was no recital that it was separate property of wife, some of payments being made out of husband’s bank deposits, presumption was that property was community property. Bear Lake State Bank v. Wilcox, 48 Idaho 147, 279 P. 1090 (1929).
    Note acquired by wife from husband during coverture will be presumed community property, rather than wife’s separate property, unless contrary is proved. Swager v. Peterson, 49 Idaho 785, 291 P. 1049 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed from a mother to her son was, as to the son’s wife, under this section, presumed to be community property and, under such circumstances, the burden was upon anyone attempting to show that it was not such.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where property was acquired approximately four years after marriage and title was taken in the names of both parties as husband and wife, there was a disputable yet prima facie presumption that the property was community property. The burden is on the one asserting against such presumption to establish the non-existence of its community character. Rose v. Rose, 82 Idaho 395, 353 P.2d 1089 (1960).

        Crucial question in determining status of real property granted to two named parties, the second party being referred to as “his wife,” is the source of funds from which it was purchased. Rose v. Rose, 82 Idaho 395, 353 P.2d 1089 (1960).

       <p>
        Property purchased in name of wife, partly with funds of her separate estate and partly with money borrowed during existence of community, is the separate estate of wife to the extent to which funds of her separate estate are used, and community property to the extent to which such borrowed money was used in its purchase.

        Where insured wife made a change of beneficiary from her husband to her daughter without the consent and knowledge of her husband, thus attempting to make a gift of the proceeds of the policy to the daughter, since premiums had been paid with community funds, the change of beneficiary was voidable insofar as it applied to husband’s half interest.

        Where property, or the right to receive property, is acquired during marriage as compensation for some right personal to one spouse alone, that property takes its character from the right violated and is the separate property of the injured spouse; accordingly, the right to workers’ compensation payments received because of work-related injuries suffered by one spouse during the marriage is the separate property of that spouse and not the community property of the couple after a divorce.

      Where community property, before or after the effective date of this section, is transferred by the husband and wife to a trust, regardless of the identity of the trustee, which trust originally or as amended prior or subsequent to such transfer (a) is revocable in whole or in part during their joint lives, (b) provides that the property after transfer to the trust shall remain community property and any withdrawal therefrom shall be their community property, and (c) is subject to amendment or alteration during their joint lifetime upon their joint consent, the property so transferred to such trust, and the interests of the spouses in such trust, shall be community property during the continuance of the marriage, unless the trust otherwise expressly provides. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect community property which, before or after the effective date of this section, is transferred in a manner other than as described in this section or to a trust containing different provisions than those set forth in this section; nor shall this section be construed to prohibit the trustee from conveying any trust property, real or personal, in accordance with the provisions of the trust without the consent of the husband or wife unless the trust expressly required the consent of one or both spouses.

        The unequal treatment accorded a husband and wife through the operation of this section is arbitrary on its face and demonstrates no substantial relation to the object of community property legislation; this section creates an unconstitutional distinction in the division of marital property upon divorce and therefore is a denial of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

        Contract entered into by married woman in state where her common-law disabilities have been removed will be enforced here. There is nothing wicked or immoral or contrary to public policy in permitting wife’s separate property to become liable for payment of her husband’s debts or community debts; nor is there anything in the statutes to indicate that the public policy of the state would be violated by enforcing a valid contract made by a married woman in a sister state.

     <p>
      Either the husband or the wife shall have the right to manage and control the community property, and either may bind the community property by contract, except that neither the husband nor wife may sell, convey or encumber the community real estate unless the other joins in executing the sale agreement, deed or other instrument of conveyance by which the real estate is sold, conveyed or encumbered, and any community obligation incurred by either the husband or the wife without the consent in writing of the other shall not obligate the separate property of the spouse who did not so consent; provided, however, that the husband or wife may by express power of attorney give to the other the complete power to sell, convey or encumber community property, either real or personal. All deeds, conveyances, bills of sale, or evidences of debt heretofore made in conformity herewith are hereby validated.

        Most of the cases annotated under this section were decided prior to the 1974 amendment to this section and some of the holdings may be questionable or outdated in light of such amendment and current equal protection law since they presume all control of community property to be vested in the husband. Where a holding appears particularly questionable, the words “(decision prior to 1974 amendment)” have been added to the case citation.

    This statute makes it plain that the community can not be sued, nor can judgment be rendered against it without the husband being made a party to the suit. A judgment against the wife in her sole, separate and individual capacity, is not a lien against the community. First Nat’l Bank v.

        In a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition where the husband and wife debtors divorced prior to the closing of administration, under 11 U.S.C.S. § 726(c), the wife’s separate property was liable for payment of allowed administrative claims, any allowed community claims, and for payment of any allowed claims flowing from her separate debts; however, 11 U.S.C.S. § 726(c) did not allow a distribution of the wife’s separate property to holders of claims that were enforceable only against the husband’s separate property. In re Hicks, 300 B.R. 372 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Debtor’s motion seeking turnover of prorated portion of her federal tax refund was denied. Because the refund was community property subject to equal management by either spouse, all of the prorated tax refund constituted property of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate and was available to satisfy creditors’ claims incurred by the debtor before her marriage. In re Martell, 349 B.R. 233 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Chapter 7 debtor who claimed a homestead exemption in real property she owned in Idaho was entitled to avoid a judgment lien a creditor placed on the property six months before the debtor and her husband were divorced and her husband transferred his interest to the debtor. The creditor obtained a judgment against the debtor’s former husband after he failed to repay a debt,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-903" target="_self">§ 32-903 </a></cite>created a presumption that the property was community property at the time the creditor filed its lien, the lien attached to the debtor’s community property interest, and the lien impaired the debtor’s homestead exemption. In re Ashcraft, 415 B.R. 428 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2008).
    Because a debtor and his wife purchased a vehicle during their marriage, it was presumed to be community property under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-906" target="_self">§ 32-906</a></cite>, and they did not rebut this presumption by testifying that the vehicle was purchased with funds from the wife’s separate bank account. A Chapter 7 trustee could avoid a transfer of the vehicle from debtor to his wife, as constructively fraudulent under 11 U.S.C.S. § 548(a)(1)(B) and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c09s55-913" target="_blank">§§ 55-913</a></cite>(1)(b) and 55-914(1), as the transfer occurred within the applicable reach back period, the debtor was insolvent at the time, and he transferred the vehicle for less than reasonably equivalent value.

        In action for foreclosure of mortgage, the government was not entitled to an equitable lien or mortgage upon property under doctrine of equitable estoppel, without deception or negligence on part of wife, where mortgage on community real property had been executed by husband but not by wife in exchange for a home improvement loan, through farmers home administration.

        Where husband and wife sign mortgage and they or their agent cause or permit a false acknowledgment to be placed upon it, and one not a party to procuring the false certificate and without notice of its false procurement, for a fair consideration, takes instrument relying upon its verity, makers are estopped from disputing its verity. Kansas City Life Ins. Co. v. Harroun, 44 Idaho 643, 258 P. 929 (1927).
    In order to constitute an estoppel, there must have been a false representation or concealment of a material fact, made with knowledge, actual or constructive, of the falsity thereof, and the party to whom the same was made must have been without knowledge or means of acquiring knowledge of the real facts, and the false representation must have been made with intent that it should be acted upon, and was acted upon to the prejudice of the party deceived, but estoppel does not ordinarily operate to prevent a husband and wife from repudiating conveyance not executed as required by this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Inasmuch as this section but codifies an already existing common-law procedure for managing the community property, under which the express power of attorney sanctioned by this section was but one method by which the wife might be constituted her husband’s agent for purposes of dealing with the community property, the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius does not apply.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under the community property system in this state and this section, which has established a rule of co-equal management of community assets or property, when either member of the community incurs a debt for the benefit of the community, the property held by the marital community becomes liable for such a debt and the creditor may seek satisfaction of his unpaid debt from such property. Twin Falls Bank & Trust Co. v. Holley, 111 Idaho 349, 723 P.2d 893 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no such entity as a community debtor. To the extent a lending institution enters into a creditor-debtor relationship with either member of the marital community or with both members, it does so on a purely individual basis; thus, the lending institution may have a creditor-debtor relationship with either spouse separately or with both jointly.

        A contract to convey community real property which is not signed and acknowledged by both husband and wife is unenforceable against strangers to the community, for want of mutuality, and the requisite mutuality must exist at the inception of the contract.

       </p>
       <p>
        It is settled law that every instrument affecting the title to real property is subject exclusively to the laws of the state within whose jurisdiction the real property is situated; therefore, in view of the Idaho rule requiring every contract affecting community property to be signed and acknowledged by both husband and wife, contract to sell community property not signed by wife was void.

       </p>
       <p>
        The logic and policy underlying this section require that both spouses join in an oral gift of community real estate; since a married person, acting alone, cannot encumber, sell, or otherwise convey community real estate by document, the same prohibition against solitary action applies with equal force to an oral effort to achieve the same result.

        A creditor may not proceed against community assets distributed to the nondebtor spouse pursuant to a divorce decree, except where the debtor spouse is responsible for a community obligation but is not awarded sufficient community assets to satisfy such a debt.

       </p>
       <p>
        Since only if a debt is incurred for the benefit of the community does this section allow satisfaction of the unpaid debt from the community property where complaint alleged neither personal liability nor that the debt was incurred for the benefit of the community and wife had not signed the note, court could not render judgment of foreclosure on mortgage securing a promissory note against wife of deceased defendant. First Idaho Corp. v. Davis, 867 F.2d 1241 (9th Cir. 1989).

        Separate debts of either spouse may be paid from community property. The debt does not need to be incurred for the benefit of the community in order for the community to be liable. Credit Bureau of E. Idaho, Inc. v. Lecheminant, 149 Idaho 468, 235 P.3d 1188 (2010).

        To reform a mortgage, executed by husband and wife on community property, on the ground of mutual mistake, it must appear that the mistake existed as to both spouses. Such mortgage can not be reformed unless the mistake is traceable to the wife as well as the husband. This rule accords with the doctrine announced in this section requiring both spouses to join in any encumbrance of the community estate. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. McClelland, 57 Idaho 139, 63 P.2d 657 (1936).
       </p>

        Reformation of a conveyance of community property on the basis of mutual mistake is not proper unless both the husband-grantor and wife-grantor were mistaken. Collins v. Parkinson, 96 Idaho 294, 527 P.2d 1252 (1974).

        Power to Encumber Community Property.
       </h5>
       <p>
        While contracts normally will not be set aside merely because one spouse lacks the knowledge that community assets have been encumbered, a contract ought not be enforced against an unsuspecting spouse where the creditor collusively prevents the unsuspecting spouse from learning that his or her spouse is pledging community property and dissipating the proceeds received therefrom, and that the party in collusion has extended loans way beyond the security, and entirely without the bounds of reason and good judgment. Smith v. Idaho State Univ. Fed. Credit Union, 114 Idaho 680, 760 P.2d 19 (1988).
    Although community real property cannot be encumbered unless both spouses sign the deed of trust or other instrument of conveyance, where one spouse did not sign a note, however, she did sign the deed of trust therewith, and where she was aware of the contract terms when the property was encumbered, the note was not impaired by any defect in the encumbrance upon the real property; in any event, other spouse’s signature was enough to give force to the note. Pocatello R.R. Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Galloway, 117 Idaho 739, 791 P.2d 1318 (Ct. App. 1990).

       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to protect the community, and it is not intended to permit one who has substantially profited by a contract within the statute to defeat payments to which he has agreed. Finlayson v. Waller, 64 Idaho 618, 134 P.2d 1069 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        A contract to convey community real estate which was not signed and acknowledged by both the husband and wife where both had fully performed was not void since this section was enacted for the purpose of protecting the community and cannot be invoked by a third party to gain advantage over the community. Tew v. Manwaring, 94 Idaho 50, 480 P.2d 896 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is only properly used as a shield by a non-signing spouse to protect an interest in community real property — not as a sword by a third party to defeat an earlier recorded encumbrance. The benefit of this section is only intended to flow to the non-signing spouse for the protection of his or her interest in community real property, and it is only the non-signing spouse who may ask a court to declare an attempted transfer void.

        A wife’s interest in community property is a present, vested interest, equal to that of the husband and is not a mere “expectancy.” Radermacher v. Radermacher, 61 Idaho 261, 100 P.2d 955 (1940).
    The character of community property is fixed at the time of its acquisition and the wife’s interest vests at that time. Morgan v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 68 Idaho 506, 201 P.2d 976 (1948).

        There is authority in Idaho for agreements transmuting property at the time of the execution of the agreement, and for agreements transmuting property at the death of one of the spouses; the intent of the parties should, if possible, be ascertained from the language contained in their contract, and, unless it contains absurdities or contradictions, the contract is the best evidence of the parties’ intent.

Consequently, in dividing property in a divorce proceeding, the magistrate acted properly when she refused to recognize an alleged oral or informal transmutation of a wife’s separate real property into community property during the marriage, where there was no evidence of compliance with any of the statutory formalities.

       <p>
        Idaho appellate courts have repeatedly used the term “marriage settlements” to refer not only to prenuptial agreements, but also to agreements made with an eye towards separation and/or divorce, and because agreements made in contemplation of divorce are “marriage settlements,” they are subject to the requirement of this section that they be in writing and acknowledged.

        Aside from stating that the community residence would be sold and any remaining money divided equally, the divorce decree did not address the division of the property; because the decree did not adjudicate any community personal property, the ex-husband’s retirement accounts were omitted assets and because any agreement regarding the division of the retirement accounts was not in writing, it was unenforceable by either party. Pike v. Pike, 139 Idaho 406, 80 P.3d 342 (Ct. App. 2003).
    Magistrate’s refusal to consider evidence of parties’ partial performance of their alleged oral prenuptial agreement to keep their property separate was affirmed.

        In a divorce action, the magistrate’s finding that a 1998 quitclaim deed from the husband to himself and the wife did not transmute the husband’s home from separate to community property was supported by substantial competent evidence, because the husband signed the quitclaim deed simply because a lender presented it to him during a loan closing, he signed it along with many other papers the lender presented to him, he had no intent to transmute his property into community property, and he alone signed the promissory note for the new loan.

For instance<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t32c09s32-923" target="_self">§ 32-923</a></cite>, Idaho Code contains subsections (1) and (2) with subsection (1) containing subdivisions (a) through (h).

       The definition of “premarital agreement” set forth in subsection (1) is limited to an agreement between prospective spouses made in contemplation of and to be effective upon marriage. Agreements between persons living together but not contemplating marriage (see Marvin v. Marvin, 18 Cal.3d 660 (1976), judgment after trial modified, 122 Cal. App. 3d 871 (1981)) and post-nuptial or separation agreements are outside the scope of this Act. Formal requirements are prescribed by Section 2. An illustrative list of matters which may be included in an agreement is set forth in Section 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) is designed to embrace all forms of property and interests therein. These may include rights in a professional license or practice, employee benefit plans, pension and retirement accounts, and so on. The reference to income or earnings includes both income from property and earnings from personal services.

       This section restates the common requirement that a premarital agreement be reduced to writing and signed by both parties (see Ariz. Rev.

Stats. § 108.140; Vernon’s Texas Codes Ann. § 5.44; Vermont Stats. Ann. Title 12, § 181). Many states also require other formalities, including notarization or an acknowledgement (see, e.g., Arizona, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico) but may then permit the formal statutory requirement to be avoided or satisfied subsequent to execution (see In re Marriage of Cleveland, 76 Cal. App. 3d 357 (1977) (premarital agreement never acknowledged but “proved” by sworn testimony of parties in dissolution proceeding)). This act dispenses with all formal requirements except a writing signed by both parties. Although the section is framed in the singular, the agreement may consist of one or more documents intended to be part of the agreement and executed as required by this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2 also restates what appears to be the almost universal rule regarding the marriage as consideration for a premarital agreement (see, e.g., Ga. Code<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.20.html#t20c03s20-303" target="_blank">§ 20-303</a></cite>; Barnhill v. Barnhill, 386 So.2d 749 (Ala. Civ. App. 1980); Estate of Gillilan v. Estate of Gillilan, 406 N.E.2d 981 (Ind. App. 1980); Friedlander v. Friedlander, 494 P.2d 208 (Wash. 1972); but cf. Wilson v. Wilson, 170 A.2d 679, 685 (Me. 1961)). The primary importance of this rule has been to provide a degree of mutuality of benefits to support the enforceability of a premarital agreement. A marriage is a prerequisite for the effectiveness of a premarital agreement under this act (see Section 4). This requires that there be a ceremonial marriage. Even if this marriage is subsequently determined to have been void, Section 7 may provide limits of enforceability of an agreement entered into in contemplation of that marriage. Consideration as such is not required and the standards for enforceability are established by Sections 6 and 7. Nevertheless, this provision is retained here as a desirable, if not essential, restatement of the law. On the other hand, the fact that marriage is deemed to be consideration for the purpose of this act does not change the rules applicable in other areas of law (see, e.g., 26 U.S.C.A. § 2043 (release of certain marital rights not treated as consideration for federal estate tax), 2512; Merrill v. Fahs, 324 U.S. 308, rehearing denied 324 U.S. 888 (release of marital rights in premarital agreement not adequate and full consideration for purposes of federal gift tax).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, a premarital agreement is a contract. As required for any other contract, the parties must have the capacity to contract in order to enter into a binding agreement. Those persons who lack the capacity to contract but who under other provisions of law are permitted to enter into a binding agreement may enter into a premarital agreement under those other provisions of law.

       Section 3 permits the parties to contract in a premarital agreement with respect to any matter listed and any other matter not in violation of public policy or any statute imposing a criminal penalty. The matters are intended to be illustrative, not exclusive. Paragraph (4) of subsection (a) specifically authorizes the parties to deal with spousal support obligations. There is a split in authority among the states as to whether a premarital agreement may control the issue of spousal support. Some few states do not permit a premarital agreement to control this issue (see, e.g., In re Marriage of Winegard, 278 N.W.2d 505 (Iowa 1979); Fricke v. Fricke, 42 N.W.2d 500 (Wis. 1950)). However, the better view and growing trend is to permit a premarital agreement to govern this matter if the agreement and the circumstances of its execution satisfy certain standards (see, e.g., Newman v. Newman, 653 P.2d 728 (Colo. Sup. Ct. 1982); Parniawski v. Parniawski, 359 A.2d 719 (Conn. 1976); Volid v. Volid, 286 N.E.2d 42 (Ill. 1972); Osborne v. Osborne, 428 N.E.2d 810 (Mass. 1981); Hudson v. Hudson, 350 P.2d 596 (Okla. 1960); Unander v. Unander, 506 P.2d 719 (Ore. 1973)) (see Sections 7 and 8).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (8) of subsection (a) makes clear that the parties may also contract with respect to other matters, including personal rights and obligations, not in violation of public policy or a criminal statute. Hence, subject to this limitation, an agreement may provide for such matters as the choice of abode, the freedom to pursue career opportunities, the upbringing of children, and so on. However, subsection (b) of this section makes clear that an agreement may not adversely affect what would otherwise be the obligation of a party to a child.

       This section establishes a marriage as a prerequisite for the effectiveness of a premarital agreement. As a consequence, the act does not provide for a situation where persons live together without marrying. In that situation, the parties must look to the other law of the jurisdiction (see Marvin v. Marvin, 18 Cal.3d 660 (1976); judgment after trial modified, 122 Cal. App. 3d 871 (1981)).

       This section sets forth the conditions which must be proven to avoid the enforcement of a premarital agreement. If prospective spouses enter into a premarital agreement and their subsequent marriage is determined to be void, the enforceability of the agreement is governed by Section 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conditions stated under subsection (a) are comparable to concepts which are expressed in the statutory and decisional law of many jurisdictions. Enforcement based on disclosure and voluntary execution is perhaps most common (see, e.g., Ark. Stats.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c03s55-309" target="_blank">§ 55-309</a></cite>; Minn. Stats. Ann. § 519.11; Estate of Kaufmann, 171 A.2d 48 (Pa. 1961) (alternate holding)). However, knowledge or reason to know, together with voluntary execution, may also be sufficient (see, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.36.html#t36c06s36-606" target="_blank">§ 36-606</a></cite>; Barnhill v. Barnhill, 386 So.2d 749 (Ala. Civ. App. 1980); Del Vecchio v. Del Vecchio, 143 So.2d 17 (Fla. 1962); Coward and Coward, 582 P.2d 834 (Ore. App. 1978); but see Matter of Estate of Lebsock, 618 P.2d 683 (Colo. App. 1980)) and so may a voluntary, knowing waiver (see Hafner v. Hafner, 295 N.W.2d 567 (Minn. 1980)). In each of these situations, it should be underscored that execution must have been voluntary (see Lutgert v. Lutgert, 338 So.2d 1111 (Fla. 1976); see also 13 Del. Code 1974 § 301 (10 day waiting period)). Finally, a premarital agreement is enforceable if enforcement would not have been unconscionable at the time the agreement was executed (cf. Hartz v. Hartz, 234 A.2d 865 (Md. 1967) (premarital agreement upheld if no disclosure but agreement was fair and equitable under the circumstances)).
    The test of “unconscionability” is drawn from Section 306 of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act (UMDA) (see Ferry v. Ferry, 586 S.W.2d 782 (Mo. 1979); see also Newman v. Newman, 653 P.2d 728 (Colo. Sup. Ct. 1982) (maintenance provisions of premarital agreement tested for unconscionability at time of marriage termination)). The following discussion set forth in the Commissioner’s Note to Section 306 of the UMDA is equally appropriate here:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Subsection (b) undergirds the freedom allowed the parties by making clear that the terms of the agreement respecting maintenance and property disposition are binding upon the court unless those terms are found to be unconscionable. The standard of unconscionability is used in commercial law, where its meaning includes protection against onesidedness, oppression, or unfair surprise (see section 2-302, Uniform Commercial Code), and in contract law, Scott v. U.S., 12 Wall (U.S.) 443 (1870) (‘contract . . . unreasonable and unconscionable but not void for fraud’); Stiefler v. McCullough, 174 N.E. 823, 97 Ind. App. 123 (1931); Terre Haute Cooperage v. Branscome, 35 So.2d 537, 203 Miss. 493 (1948); Carter v. Boone County Trust Co., 92 S.W.2d 647, 338 Mo. 629 (1936). It has been used in cases respecting divorce settlements or awards. Bell v. Bell, 371 P.2d 773, 150 Colo. 174 (1962) (‘this division of property is manifestly unfair, inequitable and unconscionable’). Hence the act does not introduce a novel standard unknown to the law. In the context of negotiations between spouses as to the financial incidents of their marriage, the standard includes protection against overreaching, concealment of assets, and sharp dealing not consistent with the obligations of marital partners to deal fairly with each other.

       “In order to determine whether the agreement is unconscionable, the court may look to the economic circumstances of the parties resulting from the agreement, and any other relevant evidence such as the conditions under which the agreement was made, including the knowledge of the other party. If the court finds the agreement not unconscionable, its terms respecting property division and maintenance may not be altered by the court at the hearing.”
      </p>
      <p>
       (Commissioner’s Note, Sec. 306, Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in Section 6 makes the absence of assistance of independent legal counsel a condition for the unenforceability of a premarital agreement. However, lack of that assistance may well be a factor in determining whether the conditions stated in Section 6 may have existed (see e.g., Del Vecchio v. Del Vecchio, 143 So.2d 17 (Fla. 1962)).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the conditions stated in subsection (a) are not proven, if a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support, subsection (b) authorizes a court to provide very limited relief to a party who would otherwise be eligible for public welfare (see, e.g., Osborne v. Osborne, 428 N.E.2d 810 (Mass. 1981) (dictum); Unander v. Unander, 506 P.2d 719 (Ore. 1973) (dictum)).
      </p>
      <p>
       No special provision is made for enforcement of provisions of a premarital agreement relating to personal rights and obligations. However, a premarital agreement is a contract and these provisions may be enforced to the extent that they are enforceable under otherwise applicable law (see Avitzur v. Avitzur, 459 N.Y.S. 2d 572 (Ct. App.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6 is framed in a manner to require the party who alleges that a premarital agreement is not enforceable to bear the burden of proof as to that allegation. The statutory law conflicts on the issue of where the burden of proof lies (contrast Ark. Stats.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c03s55-313" target="_blank">§ 55-313</a></cite>; 31 Minn. Stats. Ann. § 519.11 with Vernon’s Texas Codes Ann. § 5.45). Similarly, some courts have placed the burden on the attacking spouse to prove the invalidity of the agreement. Linker v. Linker, 470 P.2d 921 (Colo. 1970); Matter of Estate of Benker, 296 N.W.2d 167 (Mich. App. 1980); Estate of Kauffmann, 171 A.2d 48 (Pa. 1961). Some have placed the burden upon those relying upon the agreement to prove its validity. Hartz v. Hartz, 234 A.2d 865 (Md. 1967). Finally, several have adopted a middle ground by stating that a premarital agreement is presumptively valid but if a disproportionate disposition is made for the wife, the husband bears the burden of proof of showing adequate disclosure. (Del Vecchio v. Del Vecchio, 143 So.2d 17 (Fla. 1962); Christians v. Christians, 44 N.W.2d 431 (Iowa 1950); In re Neis’ Estate, 225 P.2d 110 (Kans. 1950); Truitt v. Truitt’s Adm’r, 162 S.W.2d 31 (Ky. 1942); In re Estate of Strickland, 149 N.W.2d 344 (Neb. 1967); Kosik v. George, 452 P.2d 560 (Ore. 1969); Friedlander v. Friedlander, 494 P.2d 208 (Wash. 1972).

      <p>
       Under this section a void marriage does not completely invalidate a premarital agreement but does substantially limit its enforceability. Where parties have married and lived together for a substantial period of time and one or both have relied on the existence of a premarital agreement, the failure to enforce the agreement may well be inequitable. This section, accordingly, provides the court discretion to enforce the agreement to the extent necessary to avoid the inequitable result (see Annot., 46 A.L.R.3d 1403).

     <p>
      Any statute of limitations applicable to an action asserting a claim for relief under a premarital agreement is tolled as to the premarital agreement during the marriage of the parties. However, equitable defenses limiting the time for enforcement, including laches and estoppel, are available to either party.

       In order to avoid the potentially disruptive effect of compelling litigation between the spouses in order to escape the running of an applicable statute of limitations, section 8 tolls any applicable statute during the marriage of the parties (contrast Dykema v. Dykema, 412 N.E.2d 13 (Ill. App. 1980) (statute of limitations not tolled where fraud not adequately pleaded, hence premarital agreement enforced at death)). However, a party is not completely free to sit on his or her rights because the section does preserve certain equitable defenses.

       When a husband and wife live in a state of separation, without being divorced, any court of competent jurisdiction, upon application of either, if an inhabitant of this state, may inquire into the custody of any unmarried minor child of the marriage, and may award the custody of such child to either, for such time and under such regulations as the case may require.

         “Disability” means, with respect to an individual, any mental or physical impairment which substantially limits one (1) or more major life activities of the individual including, but not limited to, self-care, manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning or working, or a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. Disability shall not include transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, other sexual behavior disorders, substance use disorders, compulsive gambling, kleptomania or pyromania. Sexual preference or orientation is not considered an impairment or disability. Whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be determined without consideration of the affect of corrective or mitigating measures used to reduce the effects of the impairment.

The court shall advise the parent of such right. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any new or additional obligations on state or local governments to purchase or provide adaptive equipment or supportive services for parents with disabilities. In any case where the disability of a parent is found by the court to be relevant to an award of custody of a child, the court shall make specific findings concerning the disability and what affect, if any, the court finds the disability has on the best interests of the child.

       <p>
        A father, seeking custody of his minor son by writ of habeas corpus from the maternal grandparents after the death of the mother, sustained his burden of proof by showing that he was the natural father of the child and the burden was then upon the defendants to prove that he was unfit or unable to properly care for the child or that he had forfeited his right by abandonment.

       <p>
        In a proceeding of habeas corpus filed by father to obtain custody of child who was in the home of the grandmother, a determination in favor of the father based on ground that he was a fit person to take care of his child even though he had not supported child for five years due to sickness and insufficient funds, was set aside by the supreme court on the ground that father was not in a position to adequately care for the child, whereas the grandmother had given the child a comfortable home to which the child was much attached.

        After the husband pleaded guilty to domestic battery, his wife left Idaho and fled to Oregon with their minor child. Magistrate court abused its discretion by ordering the wife to return with their child to Boise or surrender child custody. It was error for the magistrate court to fail to make findings on the wife’s argument that the husband’s habitual domestic violence overcame the presumption that joint custody was in the child’s best interest.

The application for the warrant must include the statements required by section 32-11-308(b), Idaho Code.

      § 32-1201. Statement of legislative intent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that a significant number of people who are owed child support are not paid in accordance with the terms of their child support orders; and that income withholding is an effective remedy to insure compliance with child support orders. The following legislation is enacted to ensure that all child support orders will include in them the authority necessary to permit wage withholding. The legislation also includes provisions for the establishment of a support order to insure that all dependent children are adequately supported, regardless of the past or current marital status of the parents. This chapter shall be liberally construed to assure that all dependent children are adequately supported.

        Where defendant minor was cited for violating Wendell City, Idaho, Ordinance No. 442, a curfew ordinance which prohibited a minor from being in public from 11:00 p.m. till 5:00 a.m., the supreme court held that the ordinance was a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction with only an incidental effect on First Amendment freedoms; the ordinance was a valid enactment within the city’s power under this section, served the government’s interest in keeping juveniles off the streets, and did not reach an amount of conduct that was greater than necessary to further the city’s interests in the physical well-being of minors.

       Domestic violence is a serious crime that causes substantial damage to victims and children, as well as to the community. Families experiencing domestic violence are often involved in more than one (1) court proceeding including divorce and custody cases, as well as civil and criminal proceedings regarding domestic violence, substance abuse and child protection. Substantial state and county resources are required each year for the incarceration, supervision and treatment of batterers.

       Domestic violence courts hold offenders accountable, increase victim safety, provide greater judicial monitoring and coordinate information to provide effective interaction and use of resources among the courts, justice system personnel and community agencies. Effective case management and coordination ensure that decisions in one (1) case do not conflict with existing orders in other civil and criminal cases and provide courts with the necessary information to protect victims and families.

     <ol>
      <li id="t32c17s32-1702ol11">
       Give constitutionally required deference to the decisions of fit parents in custody actions brought by third parties;

       Subject to such constitutionally required deference, meet the needs of children for caring and stable homes by providing a flexible method by which a third party who has cared for and supported a child may obtain legal and physical custody of the child where such custody is in the child’s best interests.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol11">
       “De facto custodian” means an individual who:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol11a">
         Is related to a child within the third degree of consanguinity; and
        </li>
        <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol11b">
         Either individually or together with a copetitioner has been the primary caretaker and primary financial supporter of such child [and such child] has resided with the individual without a parent present and with a lack of demonstrated consistent participation by a parent for a period of:
         <ol type="i">
          <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol11bi">
           Six (6) months or more if the child is under three (3) years of age; or

           One (1) year or more if the child is three (3) years of age or older.

         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol11c">
         For purposes of the definition in this section, “lack of demonstrated consistent participation” by a parent means refusal or failure to comply with the duties imposed upon the parent by the parent-child relationship. When determining a “lack of demonstrated consistent participation,” the court may consider parent involvement in providing the child necessary food, clothing, shelter, health care and education and in creating a nurturing and consistent relationship for the child’s physical, mental or emotional health and development.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol12">
       In determining if a petitioner or intervenor is a de facto custodian for the child, the court shall also take into consideration whether the child is currently residing with the petitioner or intervenor and, if not, the length of time since the child resided with the petitioner or intervenor.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol13">
       Any period of time after the filing of a petition pursuant to this chapter shall not be included in determining whether the child has resided with the individual for the time period as provided in subsection (1) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol14">
       An individual shall not be deemed a de facto custodian if a child has resided with the individual because:

        <li id="t32c17s32-1703ol14a">
         The child was placed in the individual’s care through a court order or voluntary placement agreement under title 16, Idaho Code; or
        </li>
