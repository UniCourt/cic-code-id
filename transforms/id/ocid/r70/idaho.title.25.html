      In order to prevent the introduction or dissemination of scrapie or other contagious, infectious or communicable diseases into or among the sheep or goat population of Idaho, the board is granted authority to identify diseases of concern and to condemn infected herds and to require the destruction or other disposition as approved by the board of such herd or herds. The board is authorized to reimburse the owner by cash payment for any affected or exposed sheep or goats which have been condemned, appraised and slaughtered or destroyed or otherwise disposed of by direction of the board and for property destroyed and for labor employed in digging trenches and for cleaning and disinfecting premises where such infected or exposed sheep and goats have been kept; provided, that the board shall only pay the difference between the appraised price less federal indemnity and salvage value for any sheep or goats condemned and slaughtered or destroyed under this section and the actual costs for burials or disposal of animal carcasses and for cleaning and disinfecting of premises where infected or exposed sheep or goats have been kept. In the event federal indemnity is unavailable in regard to the value of the sheep or goats, the board shall only pay the difference between the appraised price and salvage value. Appraisals shall be performed by a team comprised of an animal health representative, the owner and a person with experience in sheep or goat marketing. A maximum per head value may be established by rules of the board. The board or its designee may grant a hearing to any person, under such rules as the board may prescribe which are in compliance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, when the appraisal price is in dispute. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the board or its designee under the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

       <p>
        The subject matter of this chapter has been a fruitful source of legislation, which, until the enactment of 1905, p. 39, was confined to the inspection and sanitary regulation of sheep. R.S.,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.1213.html#t1213c12s1213-1222" target="_blank">§§ 1213-1222 </a></cite>authorized the appointment of sheep commissioners in each county, who were intrusted with the duty of inspecting bands of sheep therein. These sections were superseded by 1893, p. 79, which, however, perpetuated the same system, with additional provisions. The latter act was in turn repealed by 1895, p. 124, which inaugurated a system of state inspection, and which provided for the appointment of a state inspector and deputies. The act of 1895 was reenacted, with the exception of certain sections which had been held unconstitutional by 1899, p. 184, but was repealed by 1899, p. 352. An act of 1901, p. 142, repealed this latter act of 1899. The Act of 1905, p. 39, for the first time applied the inspection and quarantine regulations to cattle and other animals, repealed such sections of the 1901 sheep law as created the office of sheep inspector and deputy inspectors, leaving the other sections in force insofar as they were not inconsistent or in conflict with the 1905 law, and imposed the duties of sheep inspector and deputy sheep inspectors on the veterinary surgeon and his assistant, and the livestock inspectors created by the 1905 law. An act concerning diseased animals was added by 1903, p. 201, and an act on the extermination of predatory animals by 1907, p. 452. The entire law was consolidated in the Revised Codes. Subsequent to this consolidation and prior to the adoption of the Compiled Laws the legislature made many minor amendments, but usually by specific reference to the section affected. The principal changes were in relation to the extermination of predatory animals and the funds for that purpose (C.L., § 1197 et seq.), the appointment of the state veterinary surgeon (C.L., § 1158), and the manner of raising the livestock sanitary fund (C.L., § 1205).
    The legislature of 1919 repealed most of the law contained in C.L., ch. 66, and enacted in place of C.L., ch. 66, the present law herein contained (1919, ch. 35, p. 121). S.L. 1919, ch. 144, p. 438, relating to procedure for the destruction of cattle affected with tuberculosis, S.L. 1921, ch. 35, providing for cooperation of the state with the United States in the eradication of tuberculosis, S.L. 1943, ch. 139, providing for the livestock disease control and T.B. indemnity fund, and S.L. 1953, ch. 244, concerning the feeding of garbage to swine, also have been included in this chapter.
       </p>
       <p>
        A separate law relating to sheep diseases (S.L. 1921, ch. 15) created the state board of sheep commissioners and gave said board jurisdiction over matters pertaining to sheep which were formerly exercised by the bureau of animal husbandry. This law was repealed by S.L. 1951, ch. 250, and a new board of sheep commissioners created. This law is now compiled in chapter 1, title 25, Idaho Code.

     <p>
      The director is authorized to declare any disease, parasite or agent which: (1) has been identified by the United States department of agriculture/animal and plant health inspection service/veterinary services (USDA/APHIS/VS) as a “communicable foreign disease not known to exist in the United States”; or (2) which is not naturally occurring in or has been eradicated from Idaho and which, if introduced into Idaho, would have a devastating impact on the livestock or other animals of the state, a disease which constitutes an emergency. The presence of such disease in any state in the United States, any country contiguous to the United States, or any country from which the state of Idaho receives animals or animal products may constitute an emergency. The director is also authorized to promulgate rules which list and regulate diseases, parasites and other agents which, if introduced into the state, would result in devastation of the livestock or other animals within the state and which diseases therefore constitute an emergency. It is hereby made the duty of all persons practicing veterinary medicine in this state to report to the division immediately, by telephone or facsimile, any and all cases of exposure to or infection of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease, other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, brucellosis, tuberculosis, or any foreign, exotic or emerging disease, or such other disease or diseases as may be declared to constitute an emergency by state or national authorities that they may find existing among animals of the state. Every owner of livestock or other animals and every breeder or dealer in livestock or other animals and everyone bringing livestock or other animals into this state upon observing the appearance of, or symptoms of any disease or diseases, or who has knowledge of exposure of the livestock or other animals to diseases as herein set forth among the livestock or other animals owned by him or under his care, shall give immediate notice by telephone or facsimile to the division of the facts discovered by him as aforesaid, and any owner of livestock or other animals who shall fail to make report as herein provided shall forfeit all claims for indemnity for animals condemned and slaughtered or destroyed on account of any disease or diseases as herein provided for in accordance with the provisions made and promulgated by the division. In the event the director determines that animals in the state have been exposed to or are infected with a disease which constitutes an emergency or in the event of an outbreak of any disease or diseases as herein provided among any of the animals of this state the state board of examiners is authorized and empowered, upon the recommendation of the division, to reimburse the owner by cash payment or to issue or cause to be issued certificates of indebtedness having interest at such rate as shall be set by the said state board of examiners, for the purpose of reimbursing the owner of any affected or exposed animal, any animal ordered slaughtered or destroyed, or animals which have been condemned, appraised and slaughtered or destroyed by direction of the division, and for property destroyed and for labor employed in digging trenches, or disposing of animals by any other means and for cleaning and disinfecting premises where such infected or exposed animal or animals have been kept; provided, that the state shall only pay the difference between appraised price less federal indemnity and salvage value for any animals condemned and slaughtered or destroyed under this section and the actual costs for burial or disposal of animal carcasses and for cleaning and disinfection of premises where infected or exposed animals have been kept. In the event federal indemnity is unavailable, the state shall only pay the difference between appraised price and salvage value. Appraisals shall be performed by a team comprised of an animal health representative, the owner and a person with experience in marketing the species of the animal condemned. The director may grant a hearing to any person, under such rules as the department may prescribe which are in compliance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, when the appraisal price is in dispute. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the director under the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

      Whenever the director declares an emergency, as provided in section 25-212, Idaho Code, the director shall cause the disease to be controlled and eradicated, using such funds as have been appropriated or may hereafter be made available for such purposes; provided, that whenever the cost of disease control and eradication exceeds the funds appropriated or otherwise available for that purpose, the state board of examiners may authorize the issuance of deficiency warrants against the general fund for up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) in any one (1) year for such disease control and eradication. The director, in executing the provisions of this chapter insofar as it relates to disease control and eradication, shall have the authority to cooperate with federal, state, county and municipal agencies and private citizens in disease control and eradication efforts; provided, that the state funds shall only be used to pay the state’s share of the cost of the disease control and eradication efforts. Disease control and eradication costs may include costs for inspection, diagnosis of disease, indemnity paid to owners for infected, exposed or disease susceptible animals purchased and destroyed by order of the director, costs associated with burial or disposal of animal carcasses, and costs for cleaning and disinfecting of infected premises. Such moneys as the state shall thus become liable for shall be paid as a part of the expenses of the department of agriculture out of appropriations which shall be made by the legislature for that purpose. In all appropriations hereafter made for expenses of the department of agriculture, account shall be taken of and provision made for this item of expense.

     <p>
      In order to prevent the introduction or dissemination of pseudorabies into or among the swine population of Idaho, the division of animal industries is granted authority to condemn pseudorabies infected herds and to require the destruction of such herds. The board of examiners is authorized and empowered upon the recommendation of the division to reimburse the owner by cash payment for pseudorabies affected or exposed animals which have been appraised and slaughtered or condemned by the direction of the division, provided that the state shall only pay the difference between appraised price less federal indemnity and salvage for any livestock slaughtered or condemned under this section. In the event federal indemnity is unavailable, the state shall only pay the difference between appraised price and salvage. Appraisals shall be performed by a team comprised of an animal health representative, the owner and a person with experience in swine marketing. However, the director or his designee may grant a hearing to any person under such rules as the department may prescribe which are in compliance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, when the appraisal price is in dispute. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the director or his designee under the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

     <ol>
      <li id="t25c02s25-238ol11">
       Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of this chapter or rules promulgated under this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the department or its agent of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each offense. Persons, firms or corporations against whom civil penalties are assessed are liable for reasonable attorney’s fees. Civil penalties may be assessed in conjunction with any other department administrative action. Civil penalties may not be assessed unless the person, firm or corporation charged has been given notice and an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. If the department is unable to collect an assessed civil penalty or if any person, firm or corporation fails to pay all or a set portion of a civil penalty as determined by the department, the department may recover such amount by action in the appropriate district court. Any person, firm or corporation against whom the department has assessed a civil penalty under this chapter may, within twenty-eight (28) days of the final agency action making the assessment, seek judicial review of the assessment in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. Moneys collected for violations of this chapter, or rules promulgated under this chapter, shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the livestock disease control and T.B. indemnity fund. If the director determines that a person, firm or corporation has not complied with this chapter, or the rules promulgated under this chapter, the director shall identify appropriate corrective actions. The director may develop a formal compliance schedule to correct deficiencies caused by noncompliance. The director may, through a formal compliance schedule, allow all or part of the value of the assessed civil penalties to apply toward correction of the deficiencies.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c02s25-238ol12">
       Nothing in this section requires the director to report minor violations for prosecution when he believes that the public interest will be best served by suitable warnings or other administrative action.

      Livestock removal requirements shall apply as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t25c02s25-240ol11">
       For approved feedlots, all animals must go to slaughter except under conditions specified in rule by the department.

       For approved trader lots, brucellosis test-eligible cattle that are sexually intact cattle over eighteen (18) months or pregnant or post-pregnant cattle of any age, must receive a health certificate prior to release for breeding or grazing purposes. Cattle destined for slaughter, an approved feedlot or a livestock market are exempt from this requirement. Cattle that are not brucellosis test-eligible are not required to receive a health certificate prior to release. All non-virgin bulls and all bulls over eighteen (18) months of age leaving a trader lot must be accompanied with a current negative trichomoniasis test or undergo three (3) negative trichomoniasis tests collected at least seven (7) days apart unless they are destined for slaughter, an approved feedlot or a livestock market.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c02s25-240ol13">
       For buying stations, no health certificate or saleyard release is required because all buying station livestock must go directly to slaughter and cattle going to slaughter do not require a health certificate.

       For livestock dealers, if cattle are sold and are moving within the state, the only removal requirement is to receive a brand inspection. No health certificate is required.

       All female cattle in the state of Idaho shall be officially vaccinated for protection against brucellosis except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. “Officially vaccinated” shall mean a bovine female animal vaccinated against brucellosis in accordance with section 25-613, Idaho Code, under the supervision of a federal or state veterinary official with age limits prescribed by the department, with a vaccine approved by the department, and permanently identified as such a vaccinate and reported at the time of vaccination to the department or appropriate federal agency cooperating in the eradication of brucellosis.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c06s25-613Aol12">
       Female cattle which have not been officially vaccinated shall not be utilized for breeding or dairy purposes. Such cattle may be shipped directly to slaughter, placed in recognized feedlots within the state to be finish fed for slaughter or may be shipped out of the state of Idaho to a state that will accept them as nonvaccinated cattle. The department may require that female cattle which have not been officially vaccinated be uniquely identified as nonvaccinates and may specify in rules identification requirements, methods for identification, requirements for feedlot facilities, entry of cattle into the feedlot, removal of cattle from the feedlot, and recordkeeping requirements for feedlots which desire to finish feed nonvaccinated female cattle.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c06s25-613Aol13">
       Female cattle which have not been officially vaccinated may enter the state of Idaho from a state that does not require vaccination. Such cattle shall only be destined for feedlots approved by the director or to other locations at the discretion and under the oversight of the director. Such cattle that are to be utilized for breeding or dairy purposes must be vaccinated upon arrival at a feedlot or other facility approved by the director pursuant to the rules of the department. Female cattle, imported pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, which are eighteen (18) months of age or older (as evidenced by the loss of the first pair of temporary incisors) shall be tested negative for brucellosis to an official brucellosis test prior to being vaccinated.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c06s25-613Aol14">
       The director of the department or his designee may grant a hearing to any persons, under such rules as the department may prescribe which are in compliance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, as to whether an exception should be made to the provisions of this section. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the director or his designee under the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

      <li id="t25c06s25-613Aol15">
       Any person who shall possess or own in this state or acquire within this state any cattle contrary to the provisions of this section shall be subject to the provisions of section 25-616, Idaho Code. The department also may order that when animals are found not to be in compliance with the provisions of chapter 2, title 25, Idaho Code, and chapter 6, title 25, Idaho Code, that they be slaughtered, removed from the state, or placed in a feedlot approved by the director.

     <p>
      In order to facilitate the advancement of the state of Idaho to brucellosis class free and to maintain the state in this category, the division of animal industries is granted authority to condemn brucellosis infected herds and to require the destruction of such infected herds. The board of examiners is authorized and empowered upon the recommendation of the division, to reimburse the owner by cash payment for brucellosis affected or exposed animals which have been appraised and slaughtered by direction of the division, provided that the state shall only pay the difference between appraised price less federal indemnity and salvage for any cattle or other animals slaughtered under the provisions of this section. Appraisals shall be performed by a team made up of an animal health representative, the owner and a person with experience in marketing cattle or other animals. However, the director or his designee may grant a hearing to any person under such rules as the department may prescribe which are in compliance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, when appraisal price is in dispute. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the director or his designee under the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t25c06s25-618ol11">
       The legislature finds that significant potential exists for the spread of contagious disease to persons, livestock and other animals in Idaho, and in particular, the spread of brucellosis to livestock, elk, moose and other susceptible animals from bison emigrating into Idaho from Yellowstone national park and its environs. It is the purpose of the provisions of this section to provide for the management or eradication of bison which have not been reduced to captivity and which pose a threat to persons, livestock or other animals through the transmission of contagious disease, and to prescribe the duties of the department of agriculture with respect thereto.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c06s25-618ol12">
       When estrayed or migratory bison exposed to or affected with brucellosis or other communicable disease determined by the department to pose a significant threat to persons, livestock or other animals, enter into or are otherwise present within the state of Idaho, one (1) of the following actions will be taken by the department:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t25c06s25-618ol12a">
         The live bison may be physically removed by the safest and most expeditious means from within the state boundaries. This means may include, but is not limited to, capture, trucking, hazing/aversion or delivery to a slaughterhouse approved by the department. This shall constitute the action of choice if at all feasible.
        </li>
        <li id="t25c06s25-618ol12b">
         If live bison cannot safely or by reasonable and permanent means be removed from the state as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, they may be destroyed where they stand by the use of firearms. If firearms cannot be used with due regard for human safety and public and private property, the bison shall be relocated to a danger free area and destroyed by any practicable means of euthanasia, including the use of firearms.
        </li>
        <li id="t25c06s25-618ol12c">
         When bison of necessity or unintentionally are killed through actions of the department, the carcass remains will be disposed of by the most economical means possible. This may include but is not limited to burying, incineration, rendering or field dressing for delivery to a departmentally approved slaughterhouse or slaughter destination.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t25c06s25-618ol13">
       The department shall promulgate such rules and regulations pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, as it deems necessary to implement the provisions of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c06s25-618ol14">
       Upon the request of the department of agriculture, the department of fish and game shall cooperate with and assist the department of agriculture in accomplishing the requirements of this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The United States congress, in fulfilling the constitutional obligation to manage the property of the United States, passed the Taylor grazing act in 1934. Through this act, congress acknowledged grazing preference rights and provided for adjudication of allotments on which the grazing preference right was exercised. Livestock ranches are bought, sold, traded and inherited with assurance that the appurtenant grazing preference rights will be transferred to the new base property owner. Therefore, a grazing preference right shall be considered an appurtenance of the base property through which the grazing preference is maintained.

Brand inspection certificates shall be of the following kinds:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) An inspection certificate that is issued only when there is a change in ownership of the livestock, or when livestock is leaving the state, or when the livestock is to be slaughtered within ninety-six (96) hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) An annual inspection certificate good only for the current growing or grazing season, and which authorizes the owner to transport the livestock within and without the state. An annual inspection certificate does not authorize the sale or transfer of an ownership interest in any livestock.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Written ownership transportation permit” means a statement in writing of a form approved by the state brand board, which permit shall describe the livestock being transported, is signed and dated by the person in whose name the brand on such livestock is recorded in the office of the state brand inspector, and an acknowledgment authorizing the transportation of such livestock, within the state, listing the place of origin, place of destination of such transportation, the consignee thereof and his address, and such other information as may be required by the state brand board. An ownership transportation permit is not valid for a change in ownership of livestock, and is not valid to transport livestock outside of the state.
     </p>

Each such recommendation shall be of at least two (2) persons for each appointment to be made by the governor. If no such recommendation is made within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of any vacancy in the membership of such board, then the appointment may be made without such recommendation. If the person or persons recommended are not deemed eligible or fit by the governor, then he shall request two (2) additional names from the respective industry segment. A member of such board shall be ineligible to hold any other state or federal office providing full-time employment, or any county or elective office.

      § 25-1144. Manner of recording brands.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every stock grower whose brands are not recorded, desiring to use any brand on any livestock shall make and file an application setting forth a facsimile and description of the brand which he desires to use which application shall state the post-office address and county of his residence and he shall file such application with the state brand inspector and the same shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose, by the state brand inspector and from and after the filing of such application, the stock grower filing the same, shall have the exclusive right to use such brand, within the state of Idaho. Such recording shall be valid for a period of not more than five (5) years, as determined by rules of the state brand board, subject to the renewal provisions of section 25-1145, Idaho Code. Such person upon the filing of the brand shall pay to the state brand inspector for recording the brand the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) and the board may prorate the fee to facilitate implementation of a staggered brand renewal system. It shall be the duty of the state brand inspector to furnish without further or other charge, one (1) certified copy of the application to the owner thereof upon his request and for each additional copy he shall be paid a reasonable fee as determined by the state brand board not to exceed one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) for the additional certified copies: provided, further, that the state brand inspector shall not file or record any such brand if the same has already been filed or recorded by him in favor of some other stock grower. The certified copy of the application shall contain the registration number of such brand, description or facsimile copy of the recorded brand, location of brand on the animal, expiration of the recorded brand and the name and address of the owner of the recorded brand.

        § 25-1147. Conflicting brands.
       </h3>
       <p>
        In deciding as to conflicts of brands, the state brand inspector shall reject any brand being the same as one previously recorded in the same place on any animal; it shall also reject all brands known as solid brands and the window sash brand. A variation in the size of a letter, number or figure shall not constitute a new brand and shall be rejected. Combinations of letters, numbers or figures may be permitted, though the same letter, number or figure may have been recorded singly or together, if in the judgment of the state brand inspector, said combination is so different from any previous record as to constitute a new brand with no danger of infringement. The inspector shall have the right to reject any brand that may in his judgment endanger infringement of the previously recorded brand.

      It shall be the duty of the state brand inspector from time to time as it may be necessary, but at least every two (2) years, to cause to be published in book form a list of all brands on record at the time of publication. In the years when the brand book is not issued, the state brand inspector may issue a supplement to the brand book theretofore issued containing the additional brands or changes in ownership of brands between the time of the last publication and the time of issuing such supplement. The brand book shall contain the facsimile of all brands recorded together with the owners’ names and post-office addresses. Brand records shall be arranged in convenient form for reference. It shall be the duty of the state brand inspector to furnish free of charge to each sheriff in this state one (1) copy of said brand book and supplement, in whose office it shall be kept open for inspection by all persons. Brand books and supplements may be sold outright or by subscription to the general public at a price to be determined by the state brand inspector which price shall cover the cost of the publications.

      Livestock which shall be found by any brand inspector, deputy brand inspector or peace officer of the state in the possession of any person who shall be unable to furnish to such inspector or peace officer, upon request therefor, satisfactory evidence of the ownership of such livestock or the right to possession thereof, may be taken into the possession of such inspector or peace officer and detained by him without liability, and at the expense of the owner thereof, until the ownership of such livestock shall be established.

      The state brand inspector, all deputy brand inspectors and all peace officers authorized by the laws of the state of Idaho to enforce brand inspection laws, are authorized and it is hereby made their duty to arrest with or without warrant any person or persons found violating any of the provisions of the brand inspection laws of the state of Idaho when detected in the act of violating such law or laws or found with livestock unlawfully in their possession at the time of such arrest. Arrests made pursuant to the brand inspection laws of the state of Idaho may be affected by:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t25c11s25-1182ol11">
       Taking the offender into custody for immediate appearance before the nearest available magistrate having jurisdiction; or,
      </li>
      <li id="t25c11s25-1182ol12">
       Issuing a citation to the offender to appear before a magistrate. Said citation shall bear the date, time and place for the offender’s appearance before a magistrate; the name and address of the offender, the offense charged, the approximate location where and the approximate time when the offense was committed and other such essential and descriptive information related to the offense as may be prescribed by the state brand board by rule or regulation adopted by said state brand board. The citation shall be signed by the offender notified to appear and he shall be given a copy thereof and thereupon may be released from custody. A citation shall be issued only by mutual agreement of the arresting officer and the offender as evidenced by both their signatures on said citation. Failure of the offender to appear at the time and place specified in the citation shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be cause for issuance of a warrant for said offender’s arrest.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Whenever any person is given a written citation containing a notice to appear as hereinabove provided, the magistrate shall be a magistrate within the county where the offense charged is alleged to have been committed and who has jurisdiction of the offense, or any other magistrate in any other county with jurisdiction over the alleged offense which is agreed to be more convenient by both the officer and the offender. Whenever an offender is taken immediately before a magistrate as hereinabove provided, it shall be any magistrate within the state of Idaho who has jurisdiction of the alleged offense.

     <p>
      Each market charter is personal to the holder and the facilities covered thereby, and transferable only upon application in the same form and manner as new applications for such market charters. A change in the membership of a partnership or association, or the sale or transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in the stock ownership of a corporate market charter holder shall be deemed a transfer of the market charter, subject to the requirements of this section.

Each such application shall also be accompanied by a separate remittance of the annual charter fee. If within ten (10) days after notice to those persons to whom notice is required to be given by section 25-1725, Idaho Code, a request for a hearing is not made by such a person, the director may transfer a market charter without a hearing if he finds that such a transfer meets the conditions required for a new charter but should a hearing be necessary, an additional fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150) shall be remitted to the director before the proceedings shall begin.

The court, if satisfied from such complaint that the act or acts complained of have been or are being or are about to be committed, may issue a temporary writ without notice or bond enjoining the defendant from operating said market pending a hearing of the director but no longer than twenty-one (21) days. An audit by the packers and stockyards division [grain inspection, packers and stockyards administration] of the United States department of agriculture of said market shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained. The director shall only use such audit or audits approved by the packers and stockyards division [grain inspection, packers and stockyards administration] of the United States department of agriculture.

Within thirty (30) days after such decision or within such additional time as the district court shall allow upon good cause shown, but not exceeding sixty (60) days after said decision, the appealing party shall file with the clerk of said district court a transcript of the testimony and proof presented to the director including notice of appeal, complaint, pleadings, notices, motions and other papers filed with the director duly certified by him.

The hearing on appeal shall be had summarily and solely upon the record of the proceedings before the director, in the matter in which the appeal is taken and upon which his decision was rendered, and there shall not be any additional evidence introduced or anything in the nature of a trial de novo. The court shall not substitute its discretion for that of the director but shall determine whether the director acted capriciously, arbitrarily, or abused his discretion and whether he acted according to law. Appeals from judgments of the district court may be taken to the Supreme Court in the same manner as appeals are taken in civil actions.

        The term “this act” throughout this section refers to S.L. 1961, ch. 201, which is compiled as<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t25c17s25-1719" target="_self">§§ 25-1719 </a></cite>to 25-1726 and 25-1728 to 25-1737.

       <p>
        The bracketed insertion in the last paragraph was added by the compiler. The original enactment used the term “board” in reference to the public livestock market board. That board has since been abolished and all of its powers and duties are now exercised by the director of the department of agriculture.

        The refusal of the trial court to grant defendant’s motion for a directed verdict on the grounds that plaintiff wholly failed to prove the amount of his damages was without merit where there was ample evidence of the value of the hogs that died and of other expenses to support the verdict.

        That the regulations issued by the director of the bureau of animal industry imposed a duty on the part of the defendant company to vaccinate or inoculate hogs in compliance therewith cannot be questioned. The fact that the defendant itself did not commit the acts or omissions with which this case is concerned does not relieve it from responsibility imposed by regulations. Anderson v.

       <p>
        It was unnecessary to instruct the jury on the law covering liability of a public official when defendant veterinarian was not acting in the capacity of a public official but in his capacity as a veterinarian in connection with the vaccination of the hogs purchased by plaintiff; therefore, it was not error to refuse to give this instruction. Anderson v. Blackfoot Livestock Comm’n Co., 85 Idaho 64, 375 P.2d 704 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a veterinarian assigned or working at a salesyard was not acting in the capacity of a public official in connection with the vaccination of hogs sold to the plaintiff, it was not necessary that an instruction be given to the jury embracing the law of liability of agents of the state of Idaho or of public officials. Anderson v. Blackfoot Livestock Comm’n Co., 85 Idaho 64, 375 P.2d 704 (1962).

        An instruction proposing to instruct the jury as to the law concerning violation of statutes and regulations, in this case a regulation issued by the director of the bureau of animal industry, and to inform them that the question of whether the statute or regulation was violated and whether the violation resulted in and was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries, his hogs dying of the cholera, were questions that the jury must determine, was not erroneous.

       <p>
        Contention of the veterinarian defendant that he was acting as a public official in being placed at the hog salesyard was groundless in view of the fact that the state of Idaho did not assume responsibility of treating the hogs for hog cholera, leaving that to the salesyard, that the fee charged for vaccination was established by the veterinarian and the collection of the fee from the purchaser by agreement between the veterinarian and salesyard, the veterinarian acting not as a public official but in a private capacity and for private gain.

        When the veterinarian at a salesyard undertook the task of vaccinating the hogs plaintiff purchased, he was under a duty to comply with the regulatory requirements issued by the director of the bureau of animal industry.

        It shall be unlawful for any person, without the consent of the owner, to take possession of any bull found running at large upon the open range and to confine the same in any inclosure for the purpose of obtaining service therefrom. And in any trial for violation of the provisions of this section, upon proof on the part of the state that any person has taken possession of such bull, upon the open range, and has confined the said bull in any inclosure with cows, such fact may be considered by the jury as bearing upon the question of the intent of such person to secure unlawfully the service of such bull. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.

        In order to involve the doctrine of comity between states with respect to contracts, it is incumbent upon the party claiming such a benefit to show that his is such a contract as is contemplated by the doctrine. He must produce proof that the contract in behalf of which he seeks to invoke this rule is a foreign contract contemplated by the rule, and this doctrine is applicable to a contract within the meaning of this section when it is made in another state between parties thereof affecting livestock therein, but later moved to Idaho.

       <p>
        Where there is a failure to comply with estray laws, the taker-up is guilty of tort, and where the possession of property is acquired by tort, no demand need be made previous to the institution of a suit for the recovery of the property, and consequently the statute of limitations is set in motion without such demand. And the nondiscovery of the location of a chattel alleged to be an estray is not a material element in the computation of the period of limitation allowed by law to commence an action to recover such chattel.

        This section addresses itself to the problems of increasing the spread of highways and the flow of high-speed traffic through areas of open range grazing of livestock and where liability should be placed when a collision between livestock and auto occurs, and does not address itself to the question of liability of a livestock owner for damage caused by his stock straying across a highway and on to adjoining landowner’s property.

       </p>

        The legislature used absolute language in this section because it intended to completely immunize owners in open range areas from liability under any cause of action, while it used more limited language in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t25c21s25-2119" target="_self">§ 25-2119 </a></cite>because it intended to absolutely immunize owners from a negligence cause of action only in the limited situation where animals are lawfully present on the highway.

        There being no evidence that, in the particular area where plaintiff’s automobile struck defendant’s calf, defendant’s cattle, by custom, license, lease, or permit, were grazed or permitted to roam on “uninclosed” lands, the statute providing that no person owning or controlling a domestic animal lawfully on any highway shall be deemed guilty of negligence thereof did not relieve defendant of liability. Soran v. Schoessler, 87 Idaho 425, 394 P.2d 160 (1964), overruled on other grounds, Moreland v. Adams, 143 Idaho 687, 152 P.3d 558 (2007).

        This section impliedly makes it the duty of a person owning, or controlling the possession of, a domestic animal, to keep such animal off the highway, unless the highway is on open range; and does not absolve such person from liability for damages to a vehicle or injury to a person caused by a collision between the vehicle and any such animal, unless the highway is on open range.

        Where the bureau of land management (BLM) land undisputedly was unfenced grazing land where cattle were customarily grazed each year under permits issued by the BLM, the surrounding properties were used for grazing, and “Watch for Stock” signs were posted in the vicinity along the highway, the BLM land was open range, even though the cattle could not have entered the BLM land as a matter of right. Greer v. Ellsworth, 113 Idaho 979, 751 P.2d 675 (Ct. App. 1988).
    Under the three-tiered test of this section land is deemed “open range” if it is (1) unenclosed; (2) located outside of cities, villages and herd districts; and (3) land upon which cattle, by custom, license, lease, or permit, are grazed or permitted to roam. Hubbard v. Howard, 758 F. Supp. 594 (D. Idaho 1990), aff’d, 927 F.2d 609 (9th Cir. 1991).

       <p>
        In wrongful death action by relatives of motorcyclist who was killed after he struck calf on highway, summary judgment was properly granted to property owners. Owners were entitled to immunity since the highway where collision occurred was outside of any city, village, or herd district and, thus, was considered open range. Moreland v. Adams, 143 Idaho 687, 152 P.3d 558 (2007).

        In action for wrongful death where straying horses collided with automobile, in order to determine whether land is enclosed for the purpose of acquiring immunity under this section, the focus is not on the nature of the land from which the horses strayed so much as it is upon the land in the immediate vicinity of the highway; thus, the fact that there was no question that the land adjacent to highway was unenclosed was controlling and it was of no consequence whether area from which the horses strayed was enclosed or unenclosed. Hubbard v. Howard, 758 F. Supp. 594 (D. Idaho 1990), aff’d, 927 F.2d 609 (9th Cir. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rangeland was unenclosed as required by this section where the western end of the enclosure from which horses strayed, the end nearest state highway, was open to other rangeland; there were no obstructions between the west end of the enclosure from which horses strayed and the highway (with the exception of the bureau of land management fence which is not a containment fence); the fence surrounding the enclosure from which horses strayed was an intermittent fence with gaps in some areas; gates were routinely left open to permit cattle and horses to access watering areas; and the land immediately adjacent to the highway was unfenced rangeland belonging to the bureau of land management. Hubbard v. Howard, 758 F. Supp. 594 (D. Idaho 1990), aff’d, 927 F.2d 609 (9th Cir. 1991).

        Even if an accident occurs in a herd district, and lawful conditions are not present, the animal owner is not strictly liable; rather, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur supplies an inference that the animal owner was negligent, but that inference can be rebutted, and when properly placed at issue by the parties, the issues of lawful presence, inference of negligence, and rebuttal of the inference are questions for the trier of facts. Thus, even though the court had determined that the subject land was a herd district, the question of liability had to be left to the jury. Arguello v. Lee, Case No. CV-06-485-E-BLW, 2008 U.S. Dist.

      The sheriff, brand inspector or person authorized by either of them to feed and care for stray livestock shall receive all actual expenses incurred; but food and care shall not be charged at a rate to exceed two dollars ($2.00) per head per day for cattle and horses nor more than seventy-five cents (75¢) per head per day for other animals from the time that the sheriff or brand inspector is notified that the livestock has been taken up as estray. The sheriff or brand inspector or livestock market shall receive like costs for any time during which the livestock are in their possession. The sheriff or brand inspector may also charge and receive mileage and inspection fees for inspecting any estray livestock for the purpose of determining ownership of the livestock at the rates provided for by law or regulation. Also, standard fees shall be payable for sale by the livestock market and for health and brand inspection and assessments or taxes for sale of livestock as provided for by law.

      If the estray livestock is sold by a sheriff, after deducting the costs provided for by this chapter, particularly by section 25-2309, Idaho Code, the net proceeds of the sale shall be forwarded to the county treasurer and the county treasurer shall hold the proceeds of the sale for six (6) months.

Upon making such proof, the sheriff shall give the claimant an order on the county treasurer, which order shall be retained until the six (6) month period has expired. If such claimant is the only person claiming the livestock, the county treasurer shall turn over such moneys to the claimant. If, however, there be more than one claimant for said moneys, then such contesting claimants must bring an action within three (3) months to determine who is the owner of the livestock sold. The action shall be brought in the magistrate or district court having jurisdiction of the matter. The claimant receiving judgment in his favor shall be entitled to said moneys. In case the ownership of the livestock be not proved, or there are no claims as to the ownership of such livestock within the time provided, then the moneys in the hands of the county treasurer shall be forfeited to the school district where said animal or animals were taken up and shall, by the county treasurer, be turned over to such school district for the use of the school district.

       <p>
        The trial court erred in restricting the right of livestock owners to roam stock to only those areas where by custom, license, or permit livestock are grazed or permitted to roam, since the adoption of such a rule creates de facto herd districts in areas where by custom livestock have not been permitted to roam and thereby render this chapter unnecessary; the trial court, in effect, applied herd district rules relating to liability for roaming livestock to these areas without requiring the creation of a herd district.

       <p>
        The herd district statutes were not intended to preempt, and do not preempt, the field of livestock regulation so as to preclude local regulation; herd district statutes which by their own terms are inapplicable to “open range” areas do not preempt the field of livestock control in such areas. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if it be assumed for the purpose of discussion that the herd district statutes in some degree addressed the same problems as those addressed by a county ordinance prohibiting livestock from roaming, local enactments which merely extend the state law by way of additional restrictions or limitations are not invalid. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature contemplated a process whereby a majority of the landowners in an area could compel the county to create herd districts and thereby place upon livestock owners within such districts the duty to fence in their stock; there is nothing in that statutory scheme indicating counties may not exercise their police power to control roaming livestock, but rather must ignore any problem and wait until action is forced upon the county by the presentation of a petition for the formation of a herd district.

        The district court’s modification of the herd district boundaries by exclusion of federal lands was improper as an exercise of a legislative function by the court; the district court properly should have simply ruled that the herd district was invalid due to the inclusion of federal land.

         A majority of the owners of taxable real property, including corporations, in any area or district described by metes and bounds and who are also domiciled and resident in the state of Idaho, may petition the board of county commissioners in writing to create, modify or eliminate a herd district in such area; provided, that in the case of a petition for the purpose of eliminating an existing district or any portion thereof, said area must be contiguous to open range. Such petition shall describe the boundaries of the said proposed herd district, and shall designate what animals of the species of horses, mules, asses, cattle, swine, sheep and goats it is desired to prohibit from running at large, also prohibiting said animals from being herded upon the public highways in such district; and shall designate that the herd district shall not apply to nor cover livestock, excepting swine, which shall roam, drift or stray from open range into the district unless the district shall be inclosed by lawful fences and cattle guards as needed in roads penetrating the district so as to prevent livestock, excepting swine, from roaming, drifting or straying from open range into the district; and may designate the period of the year during which it is desired to prohibit such animals from running at large, or being herded on the highways. Such petition may also state the conditions and location(s), if any, for the construction of legal fences and cattle guards which may be required to prohibit the running at large of livestock within the interior of the proposed district; provided, that if such petition does not address the issue of interior fencing and cattle guards, the board of county commissioners shall have the power to establish such internal fencing requirements upon their approval of a proposed district. Provided, any herd district heretofore established shall retain its identity, geographic definition, and remain in full force and effect, until vacated or modified hereafter as provided by section 25-2404, Idaho Code.

       <p>
        A herd district provides an alternative to landowners who wish to protect their land from damage caused by roaming stock but do not wish, or cannot afford, to fence their land. Easley v. Lee, 111 Idaho 115, 721 P.2d 215 (1986).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature contemplated a process whereby a majority of the landowners in an area could compel the county to create herd districts and thereby place upon livestock owners within such districts the duty to fence in their stock. There is nothing in that statutory scheme indicating counties may not exercise their police power to control roaming livestock, but rather must ignore any problems and wait until action is forced upon the county by the presentation of a petition for the formation of a herd district. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).

       <p>
        Herd districts may still be created in any area not within “open range” as defined in this section. Maguire v. Yanke, 99 Idaho 829, 590 P.2d 85 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Herd districts may not be created sua sponte by a county but only in response to a petition of a majority of the landowners within a certain area and the creation of a herd district imposes civil liability upon livestock owners when their stock trespasses on the land of another. County ordinance prohibiting livestock from running at large, on the other hand, expressly provided that it should not apply to the resolution of any civil liability and, hence, the purpose and effect of the ordinance in question were different from the purpose and effect of a herd district and the ordinance did not constitute the de facto creation of a herd district. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of this section, requiring a herd district to be enclosed by a lawful fence, could not under the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t25c24s25-2404" target="_self">§ 25-2404</a></cite>, be removed in the county commissioners’ order forming the herd district. Easley v. Lee, 111 Idaho 115, 721 P.2d 215 (1986).

       <p>
        Creation of a herd district by ordinance is within the power of the county commissioners. Miller v. Miller, 113 Idaho 415, 745 P.2d 294 (1987).

       <p>
        Where the county commissioners by ordinance purported to create a herd district which contained parcels of federal land within its boundaries, the ordinance conflicted with subdivision (2)(a) of this section, and a valid herd district was not created.

       <p>
        The district court’s modification of the herd district boundaries by exclusion of federal lands was improper as an exercise of a legislative function by the court; the district court properly should have simply ruled that the herd district was invalid due to the inclusion of federal land.

       <p>
        Although animals may roam freely in open range areas without their owner’s risking liability, such is not the case in herd districts, where animals may not roam freely and owners incur a duty to keep livestock fenced. Adamson v. Blanchard, 133 Idaho 602, 990 P.2d 1213 (1999).

        Effect of Creation of Herd District.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The creation of a herd district in Idaho reinstates the English common law within that district, placing a duty on the livestock owner to fence in his stock and holding him liable for damages caused if his stock escapes onto another’s land, regardless of whether that land is fenced or not. Maguire v. Yanke, 99 Idaho 829, 590 P.2d 85 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a herd district is created, the rule of fencing out, which requires landowners to keep out another’s livestock by construction of a fence no longer applies; rather, an owner of stock who allows animals to run at large in a herd district is guilty of a misdemeanor, and additional civil liability is imposed for damage caused by trespasses of such animals without regard to the condition of the landowner’s fence. Easley v. Lee, 111 Idaho 115, 721 P.2d 215 (1986).

       <p>
        A herd district, and the liabilities resulting from the formation of a herd district, do not apply to livestock, excepting swine, that roam, drift or stray from open range into the herd district, unless the herd district is enclosed by lawful fences and cattle guards in roads penetrating the district.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The unenclosed lands within a county but outside cities and villages clearly fell within the definition of “open range” and, hence, the county had no authority to create a herd district. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        A rancher has the right to allow his cattle to roam, and he is not liable for injuries caused by ranging livestock on another’s unenclosed lands; but, the owner of the unfenced property is not liable for the injury to the livestock of another ranging on his premises. Bybee v. Clark, 118 Idaho 254, 796 P.2d 131 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In wrongful death action by relatives of motorcyclist who was killed after he struck calf on highway, summary judgment was properly granted to property owners. Owners were entitled to immunity since the highway where collision occurred was outside of any city, village, or herd district and, thus, was considered open range. Moreland v.

        The purpose of the herd district statutes is to provide an alternative to landowners who wish to protect their land from damage caused by roaming stock but do not desire, or are unable, to afford fencing out stray cattle.

        Where the sheep were in a shoulder-to-shoulder, close formation under the direction of several drivers, the sheep were not being “herded” upon the highway, but instead were being “trailed” or “driven” by the men in charge of the move.

        A finding is not clearly erroneous if it is supported by substantial and competent, though conflicting, evidence; thus, where the testimony and exhibits revealed a wheat field heavily infested with weeds, and one or more of several causes, all supported by the record, could have brought the weeds to the field including farm equipment, wild animals, other livestock, and plaintiff’s own farming practices, and testimony at trial indicated that factors other than the weeds, such as the late harvest, contributed to the reduced yield, the trial court’s findings that plaintiff’s field was in poor condition before the cattle trespassed and that other factors could have caused the weed infestation was not clearly erroneous.

       A referendum may be held at the discretion of the horse board to determine if horse owners favor an increase from one dollar ($1.00) to three dollars ($3.00) in the mandatory assessment prescribed in section 25-2505, Idaho Code. The question shall be made available to all horse owners who had a brand inspection the year prior to the referendum. Horse owners who have been issued a lifetime brand inspection after July 1, 2004, are also eligible to participate in the referendum and may do so by requesting a ballot from the Idaho horse board. The Idaho horse board shall publish notice of the referendum once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks, with the last notice being published one (1) week prior to the referendum, in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in the state. The notice shall set forth the process and procedures for voting. Any horse owner eligible to vote in the referendum, and who wishes to vote, shall contact the Idaho horse board for an official ballot as set forth in the notice. Voting on the referendum shall be open for thirty (30) days. Voting shall be by secret ballots upon which the words “Do you favor an increase from one dollar ($1.00) to three dollars ($3.00) in the mandatory assessment to fund the Idaho Horse Board?” are printed with a square before each of the printed words “YES” and “NO” with directions to insert an “X” mark in the square before the proposition which the voter favors. If a majority of the referendum vote is in favor of the mandatory assessment of three dollars ($3.00), the provisions of section 25-2505, Idaho Code, shall be extended indefinitely or until such time that the horse board deems it necessary to hold another referendum on the issue. If a majority of the referendum vote is against the three dollar ($3.00) assessment, the assessment shall remain at one dollar ($1.00). If the referendum receives a majority vote in favor of the increase, the assessment shall be increased to three dollars ($3.00) on the date the director of the department of agriculture announces the results of the referendum.

The question shall be submitted to all horse owners who paid an assessment the year before the referendum and by owners who hold a lifetime brand inspection issued since July 1, 1993. The question shall be submitted by secret ballots upon which the words, “Do you favor the continuation of a mandatory assessment to fund the Idaho Horse Board?” are printed with a square before each of the printed words “YES” and “NO” with directions to insert an “X” mark in the square before the question which the voter favors. If a majority of the referendum vote is in favor of continuing the mandatory assessment, all of the provisions of chapter 25, title 25, Idaho Code, shall continue. If a majority of the referendum vote is against continuing the mandatory assessment, the assessment imposed in section 25-2505, Idaho Code, shall cease to be mandatory on the date the director of the department of agriculture announces the results of the referendum vote. The procedures necessary to initiate a referendum under this subsection are as follows:
    (a) A referendum shall be held if the Idaho department of agriculture receives a petition requesting such a referendum signed by ten percent (10%) or more of horse owners who have had a brand inspection, in either of the two (2) immediate past years; or

      § 25-2604. Control districts.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners of any county in the state may create special control districts in the county for the control of agricultural pests infesting any such district, may levy an annual tax, not exceeding two hundredths per cent (.02%) of market value for assessment purposes of all property within such district, [and] may appoint three (3) commissioners to govern the affairs of the pest control district. The pest control district, through the authority of the board of commissioners may require the landowners or their agents in such control district to either control such agricultural pests on their own lands in such district within a specified time, or to pay the cost of controlling them if the same are controlled by agents of the district after failure of the landowner, or his agent, to perform such duty within the time limited in any notice to such owner, or agent. Cost of control services performed by employees of a pest control district shall constitute a lien against the property and any water right appurtenant thereto at the time of rendition of such service and shall be collectable as any other taxes. Charges for control services performed by a control district shall be determined by the board of county commissioners but in no case shall charges exceed the actual cost of performing such service. Such control district may be established in any precinct in the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before the same shall be established, however, it shall be necessary that a petition be filed with the clerk of the board of commissioners requesting the creation of the same, which petition shall be signed by at least twenty-five (25) qualified electors of each precinct included in the proposed control district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners shall order a public hearing on such petition at a time and place to be fixed in such order, of which hearing notice shall be given in such manner as the commissioners may order, which time, however, shall not be less than fourteen (14) days from the giving of the said notice. After such hearing, said board may by order create such control district not less than fourteen (14) days after such hearing, fix its boundaries, provide for a control program in such district and create the necessary machinery to carry out such program unless a petition of protest has been filed with the clerk of the board of commissioners. Said petition of protest shall meet the same requirements as to the number of signers and for the same number of precincts and for the same district boundaries as petitions in favor previously filed and shall be filed with the clerk of the board of commissioners not later than fourteen (14) days following said hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that a petition of protest is filed, the board of commissioners shall not declare the creation of a control district but shall call an election, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, for the purpose of determining whether or not a control district shall be created. The cost of conducting the election shall be paid from any county fund, the use of which for this purpose is not prohibited by statute. The election shall be conducted in each precinct within the proposed control district according to the provisions of chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code, and shall require the employment of two (2) election judges and one (1) clerk for each precinct. A qualified elector is any individual who is qualified to vote pursuant to the requirements of section 34-104, Idaho Code.

      The board of county commissioners of any county, at any meeting in any year, may make an order requiring all owners of dogs over an age which is to be set at the discretion of the board, within certain areas to be designated by the board as requiring dog control and lying outside the corporate limits of municipalities which have enacted and are enforcing a dog license law, to pay an annual license tax set by the board of county commissioners in each county, the said tax to be paid not later than sixty (60) days from date of said meeting at which the order is enacted; provided, that where an owner keeps dogs for breeding or commercial purposes, he shall be entitled to a kennel license covering fifteen (15) dogs which fee will also be set by the board of county commissioners in each county. Said order shall be in force and effect for one (1) year from its date and thereafter until rescinded by order of the board; and notice of such order shall be published in some newspaper of general circulation within the county in the two (2) successive issues of said paper immediately following the meeting at which such action is taken by the board of county commissioners.

      After sixty (60) days from the date of the board’s meeting at which this measure is adopted, it shall be the duty of the sheriff of the county to seize and impound any and all dogs, other than those located in a municipality within said county which has enacted and is enforcing a dog license law, at large without a collar with such license tag or disc as prescribed in section 25-2803, Idaho Code. No dog which is impounded pursuant to this section shall be killed before five (5) days, excluding weekends and holidays, have elapsed from the time of the taking up of the dog. After the five (5) days, excluding weekends and holidays, have elapsed and a reasonable effort has failed to locate the owner, the sheriff or his delegate may kill the dog in a humane manner. It shall be the duty of the sheriff of the county or his delegate also to seize and impound any and all such dogs at large wearing collars with such license tags or discs, on which the owner has failed to obtain or renew the annual license; provided, that when a dog wearing a collar with a license attached has been taken up, the sheriff shall notify the owner, if known, who may thereupon recover possession of the dog on payment of the license fee, costs, and any pertinent county fine.

        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 285, deleted “Vicious dogs —” following “at large” in the section heading; deleted the subsection (1) designation; and deleted former subsection (2), which read: “ Any dog which, when not physically provoked, physically attacks, wounds, bites or otherwise injures any person who is not trespassing, is vicious. It shall be unlawful for the owner or for the owner of premises on which a vicious dog is present to harbor a vicious dog outside a secure enclosure. A secure enclosure is one from which the animal cannot escape and for which exit and entry is controlled by the owner of the premises or owner of the animal. Any vicious dog removed from the secure enclosure must be restrained by a chain sufficient to control the vicious dog. Persons guilty of a violation of this subsection, and in addition to any liability as provided in section 25-2806, Idaho Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. For a second or subsequent violation of this subsection, the court may, in the interest of public safety, order the owner to have the vicious dog destroyed or may direct the appropriate authorities to destroy the dog”.

      § 25-3101. Protection of dairy markets — Purpose.
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is to the interest of all the people that the abundant natural resources of Idaho be protected, fully developed and uniformly distributed. Among the agricultural industries of the state of Idaho that contribute to the economic welfare of the state is the dairy industry. Because of problems incurred in marketing the dairy products produced in this state and because this marketing has become more and more difficult in the presently available markets, it is necessary, in order to provide a profitable enterprise for the dairy industry of the state and to promote employment labor and to assist the dairymen of the state and those in the various industries dependent upon the dairymen, that additional markets be found and developed. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health and welfare of the citizens of our state by providing means for the protection, promotion, study, research, analysis and development of markets concerning the production and marketing of Idaho dairy products.

      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature intended the definition of “public records” to be broad enough to include a list of names obtained by an agency in the normal course of carrying out its duties; in addition, the language of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.59.html#t59c10s59-1009" target="_blank">§ 59-1009 </a></cite>clearly evidences an intent by the legislature to create a very broad scope of government records and information accessible to the public. Thus, a list of names of dairy product producers, who paid the taxes levied by this section, which was compiled by the Idaho dairy products commission fell within the purview of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.59.html#t59c10s59-1009" target="_blank">§ 59-1009</a></cite>, as “public records and all other matters,” and was subject to inspection by a private citizen.

        Two 1994 acts, chapters 72 and 73, purported to create a new Chapter 35 in Title 25. Chapter 72 was compiled as Title 25, ch. [36] 35 (§§ [25-3601] 25-3501 to [25-3608] 25-3508) while Chapter 73 was compiled as Title 25, ch. [37] 35 (§§ [25-3701] 25-3501 to [25-3709] 25-3509). In 2001 and 2004, several of those sections reassigned to Chapter [37] from their originally enacted placement in Chapter 35 were amended and redesignated in Chapter 37 by the legislature. Additionally, S.L. 1994, ch. 346 enacted new sections in Title 25, Chapter 35 and amended and redesignated other sections from Title 18, Chapter 21, to Title 25, Chapter 35, which have been compiled as designated herein. The provisions enacted by S.L. 1994, chs. 72 and 73 were permanently renumbered by S.L. 2005, ch. 25.

        In prosecution for poisoning animals, each of several acts which might constitute an offense may be charged conjunctively in a single count. State v. Farnsworth, 51 Idaho 768, 10 P.2d 295 (1932).

      Every owner, custodian or possessor of any animal, who shall permit the same to be in any building, enclosure, lane, street, square or lot of any city, county or precinct, without proper care and attention, as determined by an Idaho licensed veterinarian, or a representative of the division, shall, on conviction, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be punished in accordance with section 25-3520A, Idaho Code. It shall be the duty of any law enforcement officer or animal care and control officer, subject to the restrictions of section 25-3501A, Idaho Code, to take possession of the animal so abandoned or neglected, and care for the same until final disposition of such animal is determined in accordance with section 25-3520A or 25-3520B, Idaho Code. Every sick, disabled, infirm or crippled animal which shall be abandoned in any city, county or precinct, may if after due search no owner can be found therefor, be humanely destroyed, or other provision made for the animal by or on the order of such officer; and it shall be the duty of all law enforcement officers or animal care and control officers, to cause the same to be humanely destroyed, or other provision made therefor, on information of such abandonment. Subject to the restrictions of section 25-3501A, Idaho Code, such officer may likewise take charge of any animal that by reason of lameness, sickness, feebleness or neglect, is unfit for the activity it is performing, or that in any other manner is being cruelly treated; and, if such animal is not then in custody of its owner, such officer shall give notice thereof to such owner, if known, and may provide suitable care for such animal until final disposition of such animal is determined in accordance with section 25-3520A or 25-3520B, Idaho Code. If, in accordance with this section, a responsible owner cannot be found, the animal may be offered for adoption to a responsible person in lieu of destruction.

         At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the petitioner shall have the burden of establishing probable cause to believe that the animal was subjected to a violation of this chapter. A prior finding of probable cause to proceed on the criminal case will create a permissive inference that probable cause exists for the forfeiture proceeding. After the hearing, if the court finds probable cause exists, the court shall order immediate forfeiture of the animal to the petitioner, unless the defendant, within seventy-two (72) hours of the hearing, posts a security deposit or bond with the municipal or county treasurer in an amount determined by the court to be sufficient to repay all reasonable costs incurred, and anticipated to be incurred, for the care of the animal for at least thirty (30) days inclusive of the day of the initial seizure and may order anticipated costs up to the time set for trial on the criminal case if requested by the petitioner. If, after the hearing, the court finds that no probable cause exists, the animal shall be returned to the owner or keeper of the animal, and the owner or keeper shall not be responsible for any costs of the seizure, care or treatment, unless the person later pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a violation of this chapter.

         At the end of the time for which expenses are covered by the security deposit or bond, if the person owning or keeping the animal desires to prevent disposition of the animal, the owner or keeper shall post a new security deposit or bond with the municipal or county treasurer which must be received before the expiration date of the previous security deposit or bond. The court may correct, alter or otherwise adjust the new security deposit or bond upon a motion made before the expiration date of the previous security deposit or bond, provided however, no person may file more than one (1) motion seeking an adjustment to the new security deposit or bond.

         If a security deposit or bond has been posted in accordance with this section, the law enforcement agency or animal care and control agency may draw from that security deposit or bond reasonable costs in keeping and caring for the animal from the date of the seizure to the date of final disposition of the animal in the criminal action.

         At the end of the time for which expenses are covered by the security deposit or bond, or if no security deposit or bond has been posted in accordance with this section, the law enforcement agency or animal care and control agency may determine disposition of the animal. The owner or keeper of the animal shall be liable for all unpaid reasonable costs of the care, keeping or disposal of the animal. Posting of the security deposit or bond shall not prevent the law enforcement agency or animal care and control agency from disposing of the seized or impounded animal before the expiration of the period covered by the security deposit or bond if the court orders the forfeiture of the animal or the owner relinquishes the animal.

         Upon resolution of the criminal action, remaining funds deposited with the municipal or county treasurer which have not, and will not be expended in the care, keeping or disposal of the animal shall be remitted to the owner or keeper of the animal.

         Irrespective of any other provision of this section, if in the written determination of a licensed veterinarian, the animal is experiencing extreme pain or suffering, or is severely injured or diseased, and therefore not likely to recover, it may be immediately euthanized.

         No proceeding under this section shall be used as a basis for a continuance or to delay the criminal case nor shall proceedings in the criminal case, other than dismissal, be used as a basis to delay or continue the forfeiture proceeding as provided for in this section. Proceedings under this section are of a civil nature and governed by the Idaho rules of civil procedure except as to limitations upon the discovery process. Due to the need to conduct any proceeding necessary under this section in an expeditious manner, and the right of any criminal defendant to avoid self-incrimination, any and all discovery requests shall be granted only under authority of the court. Discovery shall be authorized with the intent to provide the necessary information relating directly to the evidence for the probable cause proceeding. In no event shall discovery mechanisms be used to unreasonably burden the opposing party. Discovery mechanisms shall not include the deposition of any party, witness or representative, the use of interrogatories, or the demand to inspect any records outside the immediate reports and financial accountings for the animal in question.

        Two 1994 acts, chapters 72 and 73, purported to create a new Chapter 35 in Title 25. Chapter 72 was compiled herein as Title 25, ch. [36] 35 (§§ [25-3601] 25-3501 to [25-3608] 25-3508) while Chapter 73 was compiled as Title 25, ch. [37] 35 (§§ [25-3701] 25-3501 to [25-3709] 25-3509). In 2001 and 2004, several of those sections reassigned to Chapter [37] from their originally enacted placement in Chapter 35 were amended and redesignated in Chapter 37 by the legislature. Additionally, S.L. 1994, ch. 346 enacted new sections in Title 25, Chapter 35 and amended and redesignated other sections from Title 18, Chapter 21, to Title 25, Chapter 35, which have been compiled as designated in Title 25, Chapter 35. The provisions enacted by S.L. 1994, chs. 72 and 73 were permanently renumbered by S.L. 2005, ch. 25.

        Two 1994 acts, chapters 72 and 73, purported to create a new chapter 35 in Title 25. Chapter 72 was compiled as Title 25, ch. [36] 35 (§§ [25-3601] 25-3501 to [25-3608] 25-3508) while chapter 73 has been compiled herein as Title 25, ch. [37] 35 (§§ [25-3701] 25-3501 to [25-3709] 25-3509). In 2001 and 2004, several of these sections reassigned to Chapter [37] from their originally enacted placement in Chapter 35 were amended and redesignated in Chapter 37 by the legislature. Additionally, S.L. 1994, ch. 346 enacted new sections in Title 25, Chapter 35 and amended and redesignated other sections from Title 18, Chapter 21, to Title 25, Chapter 35, which have been compiled as designated in Title 25, Chapter 35. The provisions enacted by S.L. 1994, chs. 72 and 73 were permanently renumbered by S.L. 2005, ch. 25.

       The legislature recognizes the importance of protecting state natural resources including surface water and ground water. It is the intent of the legislature to protect the quality of these natural resources while maintaining an ecologically sound, economically viable and socially responsible poultry industry in the state. The poultry industry produces manure and process wastewater that, when properly used, supplies valuable nutrients and organic matter to soils and is protective of the environment, but may, when improperly stored and managed, create adverse impacts on natural resources, including waters of the state. This chapter is intended to ensure that manure and process wastewater associated with poultry operations are handled in a manner that protects the natural resources of the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c40s25-4015ol12">
       Successful implementation of this chapter is dependent upon the department receiving adequate funding from the legislature. Moreover, the legislature recognizes that it is important for the state to obtain a delegated national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) program from the United States environmental protection agency under the clean water act. The department’s authority to enforce this chapter should be consistent and coordinated with the department of environmental quality’s authorities pursuant to title 39, Idaho Code, to protect state ground and surface waters and to obtain approval from the United States environmental protection agency to implement and administer an Idaho NPDES program governing the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States as defined in the federal clean water act.
