       <p>
        Entry made by judge in his docket, “damages, $310.00,” is not a judgment from which an appeal will lie to the district court. Grey v. Cederholm, 2 Idaho 34, 3 P. 12 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order denying the issuance of an order to show cause why real estate of decedent should be sold to pay debts is appealable. State ex rel. Missoula Mercantile Co. v. Whelan, 6 Idaho 78, 53 P. 2 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order of the court refusing to admit a will to probate is appealable. In re Paige’s Estate, 12 Idaho 410, 86 P. 273 (1906).

        Parent or guardian is not bound by order adjudging a child delinquent and sending him to industrial training school, unless such parent or guardian appeared or was brought into the proceeding. If he was a party, he has a right of appeal under this section. In re Sharp, 15 Idaho 120, 96 P. 563 (1908). Collateral Attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an administrator’s payments of interest on mortgage indebtedness were approved by the court and the administrator’s account, including the final account, acknowledged liability on the note and mortgage, the order settling the final account and distributing the realty involved, subject to the lien of the mortgage, was conclusive on the validity of the mortgage, and could not be collaterally attacked.

        Where no appeal was taken from either the order of October 26, 1954, providing for the family allowance or an order of May 26, 1952, these being appealable orders and no appeal having been taken therefrom, they became final. Lundy v. Lundy, 79 Idaho 185, 312 P.2d 1028 (1957).

        Nature of Right of Appeal.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Right of appeal in probate matters is purely statutory and can be taken only from judgments, orders, decrees, and proceedings enumerated in the statute. In re Coryell’s Estate, 16 Idaho 201, 101 P. 723 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        By enactment of this section, the legislature intended that certain actions taken by the courts handling the settlement of decedent’s estates were of such material consequence; that it was essential that the decisions reached by the courts in those areas should be subject to review by a higher court regardless of whether such decisions were final judgments. In re Estate of Pierce, 95 Idaho 625, 515 P.2d 1017 (1973).

        Nonappealable Orders and Judgments.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a claim against an estate is allowed and then set aside, an appeal will not lie from the order setting aside the former allowance, as such claim is then pending against the estate. In re Coryell’s Estate, 16 Idaho 201, 101 P. 723 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no provision for an appeal from an order made subsequent to closing of estate. Chandler v. Probate Court, 26 Idaho 173, 141 P. 635 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order declaring the nature of property in probate proceedings is not appealable, and an appeal is properly taken from the decree of distribution of the court. In re Skinner’s Estate, 48 Idaho 288, 282 P. 90 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        No appeal lies from an order refusing to revoke the probate of a will. Porter v. Porter, 54 Idaho 99, 28 P.2d 898 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        An appeal to district court from an order denying a motion for a change of venue, or to correct the record or to strike out, is not such an appeal as is authorized by statute. Vaught v. Struble, 63 Idaho 352, 120 P.2d 259 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order refusing the appellant’s petition for distribution taking it under consideration and finding and ordering that the estate was not ready in that there were unpaid bills was not a final order which was appealable. Lundy v. Lundy, 79 Idaho 185, 312 P.2d 1028 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the district court initially heard the objection by children of intestate to the classification of a motel as community property in the administratrix’s proposed final accounting, the district court’s order declaring the motel to be community property was not an appealable order. In re Estate of Freeburn, 97 Idaho 845, 555 P.2d 385 (1976).

        Scope of Review.

       <p>
        Appeal from an order directing a conveyance of property will not authorize a review of the action of the court in directing a sale, since appeals are specifically authorized from each of said orders. Reed v. Stewart, 12 Idaho 699, 87 P. 1002 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where objections are raised to an accounting and report in the administration of a decedent’s estate and a contested hearing is held concerning those objections, the court must make findings of fact and enter conclusions of law in respect to the objections and the account. Spencer v. Idaho First Nat’l Bank, 106 Idaho 316, 678 P.2d 108 (Ct. App. 1984).

       <p>
        No appeal having been taken or motion made within the specified time limits, the decree of distribution became a judgment, final and conclusive upon the parties to the probate court proceeding, as to all provisions thereof not changed by the amended decree, which did not affect appellant’s interest; therefore, her appeal was untimely.
