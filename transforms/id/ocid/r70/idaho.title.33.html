        The historical enactment of this section, as well as its plain language, requires that the educational affairs of the state be governed by a single board of education; therefore, an interpretation of S.L. 1993, ch. 404, section 3 providing for three autonomous governing boards of education to supervise the education affairs of the state was unconstitutional.<cite class="OAG">OAG 93-6</cite>.

       <p>
        In implementing the 1993 amendment of this section by House Bill 345, chapter 404, to comply with the constitutional requirements of Idaho Const., Art. IX, § 2, the board of education may create guidelines dividing the board into two advisory councils, one for higher education and the other for publication. However, the general supervision and control of education must be retained by the board and the duties of the councils should be structured by the board with this requirement in mind. Each council can provide oversight in its particular areas of specialization and can be fact finders for the board and can provide their findings along with recommendations to the board; however the board must retain the power to make final determinations governing state educational institutions and the public school systems in the state.<cite class="OAG">OAG 93-6</cite>.

        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 240, rewrote subsections (6)(a)-(c), which formerly read: “(a) maintain a register of courses and programs offered anywhere in the state of Idaho by postsecondary institutions which are: (1) located outside the state of Idaho and are offering courses or programs for academic credit or otherwise; or (2) located within the state of Idaho but not accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the board and are offering courses for academic credit. The acceptance of academic or nonacademic credit, at public postsecondary institutions in Idaho, is the prerogative of the state board of education; provided however, credit transferred into Idaho public postsecondary institutions from nonaccredited postsecondary institutions can be accepted only upon positive review and recommendation by the individual postsecondary institutions and with the approval of the state board of education. A nonaccredited postsecondary institution is one which is not accredited by a regional accrediting agency recognized by the state board or the United States department of education,

        Whereas the reader of this section is told that a child of school age is to be instructed in subjects commonly and usually taught in the public schools in a manner comparable to that of instruction in the public schools and in conformance with those schools’ attendance policies and regulations, and since anyone sincerely desiring to comply with the law has ready access through the department of education to the list of subjects required to be taught, and to the local school district’s policies and regulations, this section is not unconstitutional for vagueness. Bayes v. State, 117 Idaho 96, 785 P.2d 660 (Ct. App. 1989). Legislative Intent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislative scheme providing that a petition for the initial determination of whether a child is being adequately educated will be filed pursuant to the Youth Rehabilitation Act (YRA) (now Juvenile Corrections Act) is to ensure that a determination as to the adequacy of a child’s education is made by a court of competent jurisdiction without the stigma of criminal proceedings attaching. Even more obvious is society’s objective, as expressed by the legislature in the enactment of the compulsory education statutes and the YRA [now JCA], to have Idaho’s children educated so that they may be productive citizens, not disadvantaged by lack of education adequate to meet the demands of modern life. The goal is not to label children “juvenile delinquents,” by bringing them before the courts, but to achieve society’s objective by positive and orderly resolution of the parties’ differences within an impartial legal framework.

If enrollment in a specific program reaches the maximum for the program, priority for enrollment shall be given to a student who is enrolled full time in the public school. In the case of dual enrollment in a public charter school, the student who is dually enrolled shall not count toward the public charter school’s maximum enrollment restrictions. The dually enrolled student’s primary education provider shall be the provider in which the student is registered for the majority of the coursework. At no time may the dual enrollment provisions be used to circumvent a public charter school’s lottery requirements.

Additionally, a student shall be eligible if he achieves a minimum composite, core or survey test score within the average or higher-than-average range as established by the test service utilized on any nationally normed test. Demonstrated proficiency shall be used to determine eligibility for the current and next following school years. School districts and public charter schools shall provide to nonpublic students who wish to participate in dual enrollment activities the opportunity to take state tests or other standardized tests given to all regularly enrolled public school students.

      The board of trustees may deny enrollment, or may deny attendance at any of its schools by expulsion, to any pupil who is an habitual truant, or who is incorrigible, or whose conduct, in the judgment of the board, is such as to be continuously disruptive of school discipline, or of the instructional effectiveness of the school, or whose presence in a public school is detrimental to the health and safety of other pupils, or who has been expelled from another school district in this state or any other state. Any pupil having been denied enrollment or expelled may be enrolled or readmitted to the school by the board of trustees upon such reasonable conditions as may be prescribed by the board; but such enrollment or readmission shall not prevent the board from again expelling such pupil for cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided however, the board shall expel from school for a period of not less than one (1) year, twelve (12) calendar months, or may deny enrollment to, a student who has been found to have carried a weapon or firearm on school property in this state or any other state, except that the board may modify the expulsion or denial of enrollment order on a case-by-case basis. Discipline of students with disabilities shall be in accordance with the requirements of federal law part B of the individuals with disabilities education act and section 504 of the rehabilitation act. An authorized representative of the board shall report such student and incident to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      No pupil shall be expelled nor denied enrollment without the board of trustees having first given written notice to the parent or guardian of the pupil, which notice shall state the grounds for the proposed expulsion or denial of enrollment and the time and place where such parent or guardian may appear to contest the action of the board to deny school attendance, and which notice shall also state the rights of the pupil to be represented by counsel, to produce witnesses and submit evidence on his own behalf, and to cross-examine any adult witnesses who may appear against him. Within a reasonable period of time following such notification, the board of trustees shall grant the pupil and his parents or guardian a full and fair hearing on the proposed expulsion or denial of enrollment. However, the board shall allow a reasonable period of time between such notification and the holding of such hearing to allow the pupil and his parents or guardian to prepare their response to the charge. Any pupil who is within the age of compulsory attendance, who is expelled or denied enrollment as herein provided, shall come under the purview of the juvenile corrections act, and an authorized representative of the board shall, within five (5) days, give written notice of the pupil’s expulsion to the prosecuting attorney of the county of the pupil’s residence.
     </p>
     <p>
      The superintendent of any district or the principal of any school may temporarily suspend any pupil for disciplinary reasons, including student harassment, intimidation or bullying, or for other conduct disruptive of good order or of the instructional effectiveness of the school. A temporary suspension by the principal shall not exceed five (5) school days in length; and the school superintendent may extend the temporary suspension an additional ten (10) school days. Provided, that on a finding by the board of trustees that immediate return to school attendance by the temporarily suspended student would be detrimental to other pupils’ health, welfare or safety, the board of trustees may extend the temporary suspension for an additional five (5) school days. Prior to suspending any student, the superintendent or principal shall grant an informal hearing on the reasons for the suspension and the opportunity to challenge those reasons. Any pupil who has been suspended may be readmitted to the school by the superintendent or principal who suspended him upon such reasonable conditions as said superintendent or principal may prescribe. The board of trustees shall be notified of any temporary suspensions, the reasons therefor, and the response, if any, thereto.
    The board of trustees of each school district shall establish the procedure to be followed by the superintendent and principals under its jurisdiction for the purpose of effecting a temporary suspension, which procedure must conform to the minimal requirements of due process.

     <ol>
      <li id="t33c02s33-210ol11">
       It is legislative intent that parental involvement in all aspects of a child’s education in the public school system remain a priority. Substance abuse prevention programs and counseling for students attending public schools are no exception. Consequently, it is the duty of the board of trustees of each school district, including specially chartered school districts, and governing boards of charter schools, to adopt and implement policies specifying how personnel shall respond when a student discloses or is reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or any controlled substance defined by section 37-2732C, Idaho Code. Such policies shall include provisions that anonymity will be provided to the student on a faculty “need to know” basis, when a student voluntarily discloses using or being under the influence of alcohol or any controlled substance while on school property or at a school function, except as deemed reasonably necessary to protect the health and safety of others. Notification of the disclosure and availability of counseling for students shall be provided to parents, the legal guardian or child’s custodian. However, once a student is reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of section 37-2732C, Idaho Code, regardless of any previous voluntary disclosure, the school administrator or designee shall contact the student’s parent, legal guardian or custodian, and report the incident to law enforcement. The fact that a student has previously disclosed use of alcohol or a controlled substance shall not be deemed a factor in determining reasonable suspicion at a later date.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c02s33-210ol12">
       In addition to policies adopted pursuant to this section, students may, at the discretion of the district board of trustees or governing board of a charter school, be subject to other disciplinary or safety policies, regardless whether the student voluntarily discloses or is reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of district or charter school policy or section 37-2732C, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c02s33-210ol13">
       The district board of trustees or the governing board of the charter school shall ensure that procedures are developed for contacting law enforcement and the student’s parents, legal guardian or custodian regarding a student reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. District and charter school policies formulated to meet the provisions of section 37-2732C, Idaho Code, and this section shall be made available to each student, parent, guardian or custodian by August 31, 2002, and thereafter as provided by section 33-512(6), Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c02s33-210ol14">
       Any school district employee or independent contractor of an educational institution who has a reasonable suspicion that a student is using or is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance and, acting upon that suspicion, reports that suspicion to a school administrator or initiates procedures adopted by the board of trustees or governing board of the charter school pursuant to this section, shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed. Any such participant shall have the same immunity with respect to participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from such report. Any person who reports in bad faith or with malice shall not be protected by this section. Employees and independent contractors of educational institutions who intentionally harass a student through the misuse of the authority provided in this section shall not be immune from civil liability arising from the wrongful exercise of that authority and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300).
    (5) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33c02s33-210ol14a">
         “Reasonable suspicion” means an act of judgment by a school employee or independent contractor of an educational institution which leads to a reasonable and prudent belief that a student is in violation of school board or charter school governing board policy regarding alcohol or controlled substance use, or the “use” or “under the influence” provisions of section 37-2732C, Idaho Code. Said judgment shall be based on training in recognizing the signs and symptoms of alcohol and controlled substance use.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c02s33-210ol14b">
         “Intentionally harass” means a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific student which seriously alarms, annoys, threatens or intimidates the student and which serves no legitimate purpose. The course of conduct must be such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c02s33-210ol14c">
         “Course of conduct” means a pattern or series of acts over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. Constitutionally and statutorily protected activity is not included within the meaning of “course of conduct.”

       a. Whenever the board of trustees of an elementary school district shall propose to submit to the qualified electors of the district the question of issuance of bonds for the purpose of acquiring or building any secondary school building, or whenever the board of trustees of an elementary school district shall propose to otherwise establish, or to re-establish, a secondary school, said board of trustees shall first petition the state board of education to reclassify the district. Any such petition shall be in writing and shall contain such information as will enable the state board of education to determine the feasibility of maintaining an accredited secondary school by the petitioning district.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c03s33-303ol1b">
       b. If any school district, other than an elementary school district, shall have maintained no secondary school within its area for a period of five (5) successive years, the state board of education may, at any time thereafter and while such district continues to maintain no secondary school, reclassify such district as an elementary school district.

       c. Whenever the state board of education shall reclassify any district, as in this section provided, written notice thereof shall be given to the board of trustees of such district and to the board of county commissioners of any county in which the district may lie.

     </ol>
     <p>
      If the state board of education shall determine that the maintenance of an accredited secondary school by the petitioning elementary school district is feasible, it shall reclassify such district but such reclassification shall be for a period of not more than three (3) years, at the end of which period the state board of education shall review its action. If, at the time of review, the district is maintaining an accredited secondary school, its reclassification shall be made permanent, subject only to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. If, at the time of review, the district is not maintaining an accredited secondary school, the state board of education shall revoke the temporary reclassification and the district shall revert to the classification of an elementary school district.

        County commissioners of county in which a portion of joint school district is located might segregate such portion and form same into a common school district. Bobbitt v. Blake, 25 Idaho 53, 136 P. 211 (1913).

        Former law providing for formation of joint independent and rural high school districts was designed to admit of creation of joint independent school district, but such end was not to be accomplished by separate organization in each county, but same course must be pursued as in organization of districts lying wholly within one county.

     <p>
      The state board of education may approve or disapprove any plan proposing consolidation, and if it approves the same the department of education shall give notice thereof to the board of trustees of each school district proposing to consolidate and to the board of county commissioners in each county in which the proposed consolidated district would lie. Notice to the board of county commissioners shall include the legal description of the boundaries of the proposed consolidated district and a brief statement of the approved proposal, and shall be accompanied by a map of the proposed consolidated district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Not more than ten (10) days after receiving the notice from the state department of education, each board of county commissioners receiving such notice shall enter the order calling for an election on the question of approving or disapproving, and shall cause notice of such election to be published. The notice shall be published, the election shall be held and conducted and its results canvassed, in the manner and form of title 34, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the qualified school electors of any one (1) district proposing to consolidate, and voting in the election, shall constitute a majority of all such electors voting in the entire area of the proposed consolidated district, the proposed consolidation shall not be approved unless a majority of such electors in such district, voting in the election, and a majority of such electors in each of the remaining districts, voting in the election, shall approve the proposed consolidation.

     <p>
      If the qualified school electors in no one (1) of the districts proposing to consolidate, and voting in the election, constitute a majority of all such electors voting in the entire area of the proposed consolidated district, the proposed consolidation shall not be approved unless a majority of all such electors in each district, voting in the election, shall approve the proposed consolidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any plan of consolidation the existing bonded debt of any district or districts proposing to consolidate, shall not become the obligation of the proposed consolidated school district. The debt or debts shall remain an obligation of the property within the districts proposing the consolidation. Upon voter approval of the proposed consolidation, the districts proposing to consolidate shall become subdistricts of the new district as if they had been created under the provisions of section 33-351, Idaho Code. The subdistricts shall be called bond redemption subdistricts. The powers and duties of such bond redemption subdistricts shall not include authority to incur new indebtedness within the subdistricts.

      When a consolidation is approved, as hereinabove prescribed, a new school district is thereby created. The board of canvassers shall thereupon promptly notify the state department of education and the affected school districts of such result. The superintendent of public instruction shall make an appropriate order showing the creation of the district, a legal description of its boundaries, and the legal descriptions of the boundaries of the affected school districts as prescribed in section 33-308, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A school district may be divided so as to form not more than two (2) districts each of which must have contiguous boundaries, in the manner hereinafter provided, except that any district which operates and maintains a secondary school or schools shall not be divided unless the two (2) districts created out of the division shall each operate and maintain a secondary school or schools immediately following such division.
     </p>
     <p>
      A proposal to divide a school district may be initiated by its board of trustees and submitted to the state department of education. Such proposal shall contain all of the information required in a proposal to consolidate school districts as may be relevant to a proposal to divide a school district. It shall also show the manner in which it is proposed to divide or apportion the property and liabilities of the district, the names and numbers of the proposed new districts, and legal description of the proposed trustee zones.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before submitting any proposal to divide a school district, the board of trustees shall hold a hearing or hearings on the proposal within the district. Notice of such hearing or hearings shall be posted by the clerk of the board of trustees in not less than three (3) public places within the district, one (1) of which places shall be at or near the main door of the administrative offices of the school district, for not less than ten (10) days before the date of such hearing or hearings.

      The department of education shall present any such proposal to the state board of education, which may approve or disapprove the proposal, and the department of education shall give notice thereof in the manner of a proposal to consolidate school districts; except, that the state board of education shall not approve any proposal which would result in a district to be created by the division having or assuming a bonded debt in an amount exceeding the limitations imposed by law, or which would leave the area of any city in more than one (1) school district.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the state board of education shall approve the proposal to divide the district, notice of the election shall be published and the election shall be held subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code. The election shall be conducted, and the ballots shall be canvassed, according to the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code. The division shall be approved only if a majority of all votes cast at said special election by the school district electors residing within the entire existing school district and voting in the election are in favor of the division of such district, and a majority of all votes cast at said special election by the qualified voters within that portion of the proposed new district having a minority of the number of qualified voters, such portion to be determined by the number of votes cast in each area which is a contemplated new district, are in favor of the division of the district, and upon such approval two (2) new school districts shall be thereby created.

       (6) At the next regular meeting of the board of trustees following the approval of the proposal the board shall appoint from its membership a trustee for each new zone to serve as trustee until that incumbent trustee’s term expires. If the current board membership includes two (2) incumbent trustees from the same new trustee zone, the board will select the incumbent trustee with the most seniority as a trustee to serve the remainder of his term. If both incumbent trustees have equal seniority, the board will choose one (1) of the trustees by the drawing of lots. If there is a trustee vacancy in any of the new zones, the board of trustees shall appoint from the patrons resident in that new trustee zone, a person from that zone to serve as trustee until the next annual meeting. At the annual election a trustee shall be elected to serve during the term specified in the election for the zone. The elected trustee shall assume office at the annual meeting of the school district next following the election. History.

      School subdistricts may incur debt and issue bonds for the same purposes as set forth in section 33-1102, Idaho Code. The governing body of a school subdistrict may submit to the qualified electors of the school subdistrict the question of whether the governing body of the school subdistrict shall be empowered to issue negotiable bonds of the school subdistrict in an amount and for a period of time to be named in the notice of election. Notice of the bond election shall be given, the election shall be conducted and the returns thereof canvassed and the qualifications of electors voting or offering to vote shall be as provided in title 34, Idaho Code. The question of the issuance of such bonds shall be approved only if the percentage of votes cast at such election were cast in favor thereof as that which is now, or may hereafter be, set by the constitution of the state of Idaho. All such bonds shall be authorized, issued and sold pursuant to the provisions of sections 33-1107 through 33-1121, Idaho Code. No bonds of a school subdistrict may be issued, however, if the issuance of such bonds would cause the percentage of market value for assessment purposes of taxable property within the boundaries of the school subdistrict represented by the aggregate outstanding indebtedness of the school subdistrict, when added to the percentage of the assessed valuation of taxable property represented by the aggregate outstanding indebtedness of the school district within which the school subdistrict lies, to exceed five percent (5%). As used in the preceding sentence hereof, “market value for assessment purposes,” “aggregate outstanding indebtedness” and “issuance” shall have the same meanings as set forth in section 33-1103, Idaho Code. Upon the approval of the issuance of such bonds, the same may be issued by the governing body of the school subdistrict on behalf of the school subdistrict at any time within two (2) years from the date of such election.

       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Every dollar spent on energy costs in an Idaho public school is a dollar that is not spent in the direct education of students in the classroom. As energy costs increase, the diversion of funding away from the classroom will accelerate. The state has a primary interest in minimizing K-12 public school building energy costs since funding for energy comes directly from the state General Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) School districts recognize that funding will always be limited and that efficient use of every dollar is vital to providing the highest possible level of educational services. It is apparent that designing and constructing more energy efficient buildings accrue cumulative benefits to both the state and to the school district. This is because any energy efficiency built into a new school building will save money each and every year of operation for the life of that school building. Small gains in energy efficiency result in large payoffs over the life of operations of a building.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) This act provides an incentive for school districts to use certain design and construction processes for constructing high quality school buildings. Using two processes, integrated design and fundamental commissioning, will result in efficient design and construction implementation of higher performance new public school buildings. Using this design and construction process, it is the intent of this act to make energy efficiency a priority for our school districts in the design and construction of new public school buildings.”

     <p>
      The legislature finds that a comprehensive and integrated statutory scheme for the conduct of school elections is critical to the public’s understanding of and confidence in the public school election system. It is therefore the intent of the legislature that the provisions of title 18, Idaho Code, and the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code, shall be fully applicable and shall govern all school elections. All school elections shall be administered by the clerk of the county wherein the district lies. Elections in a joint school district shall be conducted jointly by the clerks of the respective counties, and the clerk of the home county shall exercise such powers as are necessary to coordinate the election.

        This section was amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 96, effective March 17, 2011. The amendment by S.L. 2011, ch. 96 was the subject of Proposition 1 at the general election on November 6, 2012. The proposition was rejected by the electorate. Thus, the 2011 amendment became null and void, and this section returned to its pre-2011 provisions, as amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 151.

The board of trustees of any district that has had a change in its district boundaries because of district consolidation on and after January 1, 2008, shall consist of five (5) members if two (2) districts consolidated or seven (7) members if three (3) or more districts consolidated.

The receiving, soliciting or acceptance of moneys of a school district for deposit in any bank or trust company, or the lending of money by any bank or trust company to any school district, shall not be deemed to be a contract pertaining to the maintenance or conduct of a school district within the meaning of this section; nor shall the payment by any school district board of trustees of compensation to any bank or trust company, for services rendered in the transaction of any banking business with such district board of trustees, be deemed the payment of any reward or compensation to any officer or director of any such bank or trust company within the meaning of this section.

The trustee shall abstain from voting in any decisions affecting the compensation, benefits, individual performance evaluation or disciplinary action related to the spouse and shall be absent from the meeting while such issues are being considered and determined. Such limitation shall include, but not be limited to: any matters relating to negotiations regarding compensation and benefits; discussion and negotiation with district benefits providers; and any matter relating to the spouse and letters of reprimand, direction, probation or termination.

        Former section, as amended in 1949 and 1951, providing for discontinuance of attendance units within reorganized districts, either by vote of the trustees, or by vote of the electors, did not violate Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 5, since in either event the tax would be uniform within the district, even though there might be different costs in the operation of the different school units. Robbins v. Joint Class A. Sch.

    Former section, as amended in 1949 and 1951, providing for discontinuance of attendance units within reorganized districts did not violate Idaho Const., Art.

        Amendments.
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2006 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 244, deleted former subsection (17), which read: “To ensure that each school district, including specially chartered school districts, participates in the Idaho student information management system (ISIMS) to the full extent of its availability. The terms ‘Idaho student information management system,’ ‘appropriate access’ and ‘real time’ shall have such meanings as the terms are defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code,” and redesignated former subsection (18) as (17).
    The 2006 amendment, by ch. 313, inserted “including rules on student harassment, intimidation and bullying” in subsection (6).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 349, in subsection (7), inserted “and welfare”; and rewrote subsections (15) and (16) to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.
       </p>
       <p>

        Language of subsection (11) evidences a legislative purpose of protecting, not prosecuting, pupils, and an interpretation of subsection (11) that criminalizes student misconduct will likely lead to unreasonably harsh results; further, an interpretation that subsection (11) is not intended to apply to public school students achieves the legislative purpose of the statute and avoids the harsh consequences of criminalizing virtually all student or teacher misconduct. State v. Doe, 140 Idaho 271, 92 P.3d 521 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory language of subsection (6) provides public school officials with an effective means of disciplining unruly or disruptive pupils in an administrative fashion, and in appropriate cases, recourse may also be had through various provisions of the criminal code, but there is little need to interpret subsection (11) as providing public school officials additional authority to pursue criminal sanctions against disruptive or detrimental public school students.

        A regulation requiring that students in a high school keep their hair length “off the eyes, off the ear, and off the collar” was held unconstitutional, when the school authorities failed to show that there was any substantial health, safety, academic or disciplinary problem created by the wearing of long hair.

Delivery of a contract may be made only in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested or electronically, return receipt requested. When delivery is made in person, delivery of the contract must be acknowledged by a signed receipt.

Should the person willfully refuse to acknowledge receipt of the contract or the contract is not signed and returned to the board in the designated period of time or if no designated period of time is set by the board, the default time, the board or its designee may declare the position vacant.

        This section was amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 96, effective March 17, 2011. The amendment by S.L. 2011, ch. 96 was the subject of Proposition 1 at the general election on November 6, 2012. The proposition was rejected by the electorate. Thus, the 2011 amendment became null and void, and this section returned to its pre-2011 provisions. This section, as amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 96, was further amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 295 and S.L. 2012, ch. 265. However, those amendments also became null and void upon the rejection of Proposition 1 at the November 6, 2012 election.

        Since this section sets out a detailed procedure to be followed when a school district seeks to employ professional personnel and teachers can be charged with knowledge of such procedure, assistant superintendent could not enter into a binding contract with teacher on behalf of the board by informing teacher that her name appeared on the school’s roster and that roster was tentative only as some teachers might retire or seek a different position, for not only did assistant superintendent lack authority to make such promise, but teacher’s reliance on such promise was unjustified.

        A school district which discharged a teacher for failure to sign a written contract to teach, for failure to register a valid teaching certificate properly indorsed by the state board of education with the school district, and for failure to return to school after termination of a vacation period did not wrongfully discharge the teacher nor defraud him of his right to be employed.

        School boards are given broad authority to define what constitutes grounds for discharge by promulgation of rules and regulations governing professional conduct of school teachers.

        Where a teacher did not contest the fact that there was widespread dissatisfaction with his grading methods, did not contend that he was unaware that this was the reason for his discharge, and had, in effect, waived his hearing, the statutory requirement that teachers be discharged only for cause was satisfied.

        A teacher discharged for paddling students when they failed to work blackboard problems was not entitled to be suspended prior to discharge, since subsection 5 of this section is written in the disjunctive. Kolp v. Board of Trustees, 102 Idaho 320, 629 P.2d 1153 (1981).

        Hearing on Discharge.

       <p>
        While a board of trustees cannot discharge a teacher except upon its finding of cause as required by subsection 5 of this section, there is no requirement that such cause be established at a hearing, unless one is requested by the teacher. Ferguson v. Board of Trustees, 98 Idaho 359, 564 P.2d 971, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 939, 98 S. Ct. 431, 54 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1977) (decided prior to 1978 amendment).
    A hearing, as referred to in this statute denotes the right to confront witnesses, cross-examine them, and present evidence on the teacher’s behalf. Ferguson v. Board of Trustees, 98 Idaho 359, 564 P.2d 971, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 939, 98 S. Ct. 431, 54 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a teacher wilfully chose not to participate in a hearing concerning his discharge, he waived his right to the hearing contemplated by this statute and by the procedures established by the state board of education. Ferguson v. Board of Trustees, 98 Idaho 359, 564 P.2d 971, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 939, 98 S. Ct. 431, 54 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1977) (decided prior to 1978 amendment).

        Judicial Review.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a teacher seeks a writ of mandate, not for reinstatement during the term of a contract, but to compel continued employment after a first-year contract has expired, judicial review is limited to determining whether the teacher has a clear legal right to the relief sought. The judicial inquiry does not extend to whether the school board acted arbitrarily, unjustly and in abuse of discretion. Knudson v. Boundary County School Dist. No. 101, 104 Idaho 93, 656 P.2d 753 (Ct. App. 1982).

        Probation.

       <p>
        A teacher who was discharged during a contract term was not entitled to the benefit of a probationary period or an improvement program. Bowler v. Board of Trustees, 101 Idaho 537, 617 P.2d 841 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        A first-year teacher had no clear legal right to probation as a prerequisite to denial of a contract for the second year. Knudson v. Boundary County School Dist. No. 101, 104 Idaho 93, 656 P.2d 753 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the legislature amended this section to provide that a probationary period be established for teachers whose work was found to be unsatisfactory, the legislature did not intend to create a vested right to probation as a prerequisite to denial of a contract for the next school year. Rather, the Legislature intended the probation requirement to be a means of securing compliance by school districts with the mandate for teacher evaluation programs. Knudson v. Boundary County School Dist. No. 101, 104 Idaho 93, 656 P.2d 753 (Ct. App. 1982) (decided prior to 1984 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where teacher was placed on probation in spring of one year, was offered and accepted contract for following year, and, in the spring of that year, was notified that contract would not be renewed, there was substantial competent evidence to support the trial court’s implicit finding that the probation established in the spring of the first year was still in effect during the second school year. Webster v. Board of Trustees, 104 Idaho 342, 659 P.2d 96 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The probation established under this section is not curtailed as a matter of law by the offer of a new contract; the probation period established by this provision is at minimum to run until the time for reissuing of contracts, and the board is not precluded from continuing a probation from one year to another. Webster v. Board of Trustees, 104 Idaho 342, 659 P.2d 96 (1983) (decided prior to 1984 amendment).

        Under former statutes requiring electors of school district to vote tax levy for maintenance of school upon trustees’ submission of budget setting forth expenditures of preceding year and requirements for ensuing year, the action of the electors of a common school district in voting on annual budget specifying amount to be used for employment of teachers and total amount to be raised by tax levy for ensuing year was binding on trustees with respect to teachers’ contracts previously executed.

        It was the duty of trustees to enter into contracts with teachers; but contracts entered into prior to the annual meeting were made subject to the statute which became part of it, giving the electors, when they met, power to modify as to wages and the length of the school year.

        Trustees of independent school district, unlike those of an ordinary school district, had unlimited power to dismiss teacher either with or without notice, and exercise of that power was not subject to review or control by courts. Ewin v. Independent School Dist. No. 8, 10 Idaho 102, 77 P. 222 (1904); Hermann v. Independent School Dist. No. 1, 24 Idaho 554, 135 P. 1159 (1913).

    Board had power to discharge teacher for breach of contract or continued neglect of duty and such discharge in good faith was good defense to action for damages resulting from such discharge. Hayes v. Independent School Dist. No. 9, 45 Idaho 464, 262 P. 862 (1928).

        This section was amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 96, effective March 17, 2011. The amendment by S.L. 2011, ch. 96 was the subject of Proposition 1 at the general election on November 6, 2012. The proposition was rejected by the electorate. Thus, the 2011 amendment, and the amendments by S.L. 2012, ch. 1 and S.L. 2012, ch. 265, became null and void, and this section returned to its pre-2011 provisions, prior to the 2013 amendments.

    Section 62 of S.L. 2015, chapter 141, amended this section, as reenacted by S.L. 2013, ch. 353, § 4, which was repealed before going into effect. The 2015 amendment has been applied to the version of this section as amended by S.L. 2013, ch. 353, § 1.

        Although the requirement of notice with regard to renewable contract teachers is a means of providing procedural due process, nontenured teachers have not been found to have a “property” interest in continued employment. Therefore, nontenured teacher was not entitled to procedural due process and the analysis of her case was confined to an application of this section. Brown v. Caldwell Sch. Dist. No. 132, 127 Idaho 112, 898 P.2d 43 (1995).

       <p>
        A school district which elects not to renew a teacher’s contract on the basis of unsatisfactory performance must first place that teacher on probation. Gunter v. Board of Trustees, 123 Idaho 910, 854 P.2d 253 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation is not required every time an annual contract teacher is not reemployed. There are circumstances unrelated to performance deficiencies which would allow a school board to make a decision not to reemploy without implicating the statutory probation requirement. Brown v. Caldwell Sch. Dist. No. 132, 127 Idaho 112, 898 P.2d 43 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although school district believed it could hire someone better than plaintiff did not necessarily mean that her work was unsatisfactory; however, if a performance deficiency in a teacher is such that it affects whether he or she will be reemployed, this section required that that teacher be placed on probation. Brown v. Caldwell Sch. Dist. No. 132, 127 Idaho 112, 898 P.2d 43 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that a statement of reasons for the decision not to reemploy be included in the notice was included to provide a teacher with the means to develop a meaningful response to an adverse decision by a board of trustees; thus, the statement of reasons provided by the board in this case was in violation. The board essentially informed teacher that its decision was based on the belief that the district would be better off without her, but did not really convey any real information as to why plaintiff’s contract was not renewed and, thus, plaintiff was given no meaningful opportunity to show why the decision was incorrect. Brown v. Caldwell Sch. Dist. No. 132, 127 Idaho 112, 898 P.2d 43 (1995).
    An annual contract teacher does not have any expectation of continued employment, since the contract is annual and nonrenewable in nature. Plaintiff completed her contract term in full and, thus, could not have been “terminated.” Smith v. Meridian Joint Sch. Dist. No. 2, 128 Idaho 714, 918 P.2d 583 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the superintendent of a teacher’s school district, instead of the board of trustees, informed the teacher that the district did not intend to reemploy her for the coming year, the board of trustees failed to take action as required, and the teacher was entitled to be treated as though she had been reemployed for that year. Rhoades v. Board of Trustees, 131 Idaho 827, 965 P.2d 187 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of this section did not obligate a school district to renew a teacher’s contract, where the teacher was an annual contract teacher who had served fewer than three years in the same school district. Kingsbury v. Genesee Sch. Dist. No. 282, 132 Idaho 791, 979 P.2d 1149 (1999).

       <p>
        The notification date set forth in the Professional Agreement of not later than May 15th was not in conflict with the express language of this section, which required notification no later than June 15th. This section does not expressly or impliedly preclude school districts from agreeing to provide notice earlier than June 15th. Hunting v. Clark County Sch. Dist.

        “Performance” is merely the means by which a teacher’s “work” is evaluated and vice versa; any attempt at drawing a distinction between “work” and “performance” is “splitting hairs.” Gunter v. Board of Trustees, 123 Idaho 910, 854 P.2d 253 (1993).

       </p>
       <p>
        The only requirement regarding probation is that, if an employee’s work is unsatisfactory, he must be placed on probation for a reasonable period of time before he can be terminated. There is nothing that requires that the contract of an annual contract teacher who has successfully completed a probationary period be renewed. Kingsbury v. Genesee Sch. Dist.

The evaluation shall include a minimum of two (2) documented observations, one (1) of which shall be completed prior to January 1 of each year.

Such period of probation shall not affect the person’s renewable contract status.

        This section was amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 96, effective March 17, 2011. The amendment by S.L. 2011, ch. 96 was the subject of Proposition 1 at the general election on November 6, 2012. The proposition was rejected by the electorate. Thus, the 2011 amendment became null and void, and this section returned to its pre-2011 provisions. This section, as amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 96, was further amended by S.L. 2011, ch. 295 and S.L. 2012, ch. 265. However, those amendments also became null and void upon the rejection of Proposition 1 at the November 6, 2012 election.

        This section was to be repealed effective July 1, 2015, pursuant to S.L. 2013, ch. 353, § 3, as amended by S.L. 2014, ch. 144, § 2, at which time a new<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t33c05s33-515" target="_self">§ 33-515 </a></cite>was to be enacted, pursuant to S.L. 2013, ch. 353, § 5. However, S.L. 2015, ch. 249, §§ 2 and 4 repealed S.L. 2013, ch. 353, §§ 3 and 5, repealing the repeal and the reenactment of the new section, effective July 1, 2015.

       <p>
        Section 63 of S.L. 2015, chapter 141 and section 14 of S.L. 2015, chapter 229 amended this section, as reenacted by S.L. 2013, ch. 353, § 5, which was repealed before going into effect. The 2015 amendments have been applied to the version of this section as amended by S.L. 2013, ch. 353, § 2 and S.L. 2014, ch. 144, § 1.

        Nothing denies a school district the power to limit its power over administrators by adopting a policy restricting its statutory discretion, and, where district did so when it adopted policy and incorporated it into principal’s contract, there was no conflict or ambiguity; thus, principal had a property right in the principalship that could be ended only in conformity with the criteria set out in district’s policy, and when without notice, without hearing and without evaluation he lost his principal’s appointment, he was denied the process of law due him in terms of his contract and the policy of the district.

        A school board, currently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations, or in mediation, with the association representing its teachers may send out binding individual contracts to teachers as required by statute, and those contracts become and are modified by applicable provisions of the agreement which, thereafter, results from negotiations and mediation which were timely brought and ongoing when the individual contracts were entered into.

        Although a teacher’s contract by its provisions covered a definite term, and in a sense, except for the statutory renewal provisions, would expire at the termination date, in actuality, however, by application of the statutory law, the contract together with the statute is better called a “continuing contract,” that can only be terminated by the school district for cause.

        Where on February 27 teacher advised school board in writing that he would decline to accept employment during the next school year, but where on March 30 teacher advised the board of his desire to withdraw the declination of future employment, teacher, whose contract was not renewed, was precluded by board’s defenses of estoppel and waiver from obtaining a reinstatement of employment and lost wages.

        A teacher’s service of over three full years of continuous employment by the same school district conferred upon her the right of automatic renewal as part and parcel of her contract, and, unless the statutory procedures were properly followed, the failure to renew her contract was a breach of that continuing contract.

If a board of trustees determines not to reissue a supplemental extra duty contract, the board shall give written notice to the employee describing reasons for the decision not to reissue. The employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal review. The process and procedure for informal review shall be determined by the board of trustees.

        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 288, designated the former second and third sentences in subsection (1) as present subsection (2) and redesignated former subsection (2) as subsection (3); inserted “or extra day” in subsection (1); in present subsection (2), inserted “extra duty” in the first and second sentences, substituted “the certificated employee’s underlying” for “an annual, a renewable or a limited one (1) year” in the second sentence, and inserted the present third through sixth sentences; rewrote subsection (3), which formerly read: “If a board of trustees determines not to reissue a supplemental contract, the board shall give written notice to the employee describing reasons for the decision not to reissue. The employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal review. The process and procedure for the informal review shall be determined by the local board of trustees. Within fifteen (15) days following the meeting with the employee, the board shall notify the employee of its final decision in the matter. Should a school district provide for additional procedures, nothing in this statute shall be interpreted to limit those procedures”; and added subsection (4). Compiler’s Notes.

    “33-515B. Reduced enrollment — Contract termination and severance stipend. — (1) Each certificated employee contract shall include a provision allowing the board of trustees to terminate the contract in the event of a reduction in student enrollment of greater than one percent (1%). The percent of certificated employees that may be so terminated shall be limited to the percent that enrollment decreased beyond said one percent (1%) reduction. The enrollment figures used for such calculations shall be the same as those used for the calculation of emergency levies pursuant to section 33-805, Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) The school district shall notify those employees whose contracts are being terminated by no later than October 1. Such termination shall be effective as of a date specified by the board of trustees, but shall be no earlier than two (2) weeks after the date that the employee received notification, and no later than the end of the current term. No other notification, hearing or other process shall be required to terminate the contracts of employees pursuant to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) Selection of which employee contracts are to be terminated shall be at the sole discretion of the board of trustees, provided however, that the board of trustees shall not use seniority or contract status as a factor in making such determinations.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) Employees whose contracts are terminated under the provisions of this section shall receive a severance payment from the school district equal to ten percent (10%) of the moneys that had yet to be earned under the contract for the remainder of the school year.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) School districts shall furnish the state department of education with a list of employees whose contracts were terminated pursuant to this section, the dates on which such terminations were effective and the percentage of salary that had yet to be earned under the contract for the remainder of the school year. The state department of education shall calculate the salary-based apportionment and state-paid employee benefit amounts for each such employee, and, after reducing this allocation to account for the percent of the employee’s salary that had already been earned for the school year, distribute ten percent (10%) of the remaining allocation to the school district as a reimbursement for severance payments made, from moneys appropriated to the educational support program.”

Prior to, but not more than one (1) year prior to, any purchase or disposal of real property, the board shall have such property appraised by an appraiser certified in the state of Idaho, which appraisal shall be entered in the records of the board of trustees and shall be used to establish the value of the real property. The board of trustees shall determine the size of the site necessary for school purposes. The site shall be located within the incorporated limits of any city within the district; provided, however, that if the board finds that it is not in the best interests of the electors and the students of the district to locate the site within the incorporated limits of a city, the board, by duly adopted resolution setting forth the reasons for its finding, may designate a site located elsewhere within the district. In elementary school districts, except upon removal for highway purposes, a site may be designated or changed only after approval of two-thirds (2/3) or more of the electors voting at the annual meeting.

Prior to any transfer or conveyance of any real or personal property pursuant to this paragraph (4)(b), the board shall have the property appraised by an appraiser certified in the state of Idaho, which appraisal shall be entered in the records of the board of trustees and shall be used to establish the value of the real or personal property. Provided however, if the board of trustees finds it is in the school district’s best interests to trade personal property to a person or entity for like kind personal property, the board of trustees may vote to elect to do so. The board of trustees may elect to abstain from an appraisal of the personal property if the estimated value of such property is less than five thousand dollars ($5,000).

      Prior to such sale or conveyance, the board shall have the property appraised pursuant to this section, which appraisal shall be entered in the records of the board of trustees. The property may be sold at public auction or by sealed bids, as the board of trustees shall determine, to the highest bidder. Such property may be sold for cash or for such terms and conditions as the board of trustees shall determine for a period not exceeding ten (10) years, with the annual rate of interest on all deferred payments not less than seven percent (7%) per annum. The title to all property sold on contract shall be retained in the name of the school district until full payment has been made by the purchaser, and title to all property sold under a note and mortgage or deed of trust shall be transferred to the purchaser at the point of sale under the terms and conditions of the mortgage or deed of trust as the board of trustees shall determine. Notice of the time and the conditions of such sale shall be published twice, and proof thereof made, in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) of section 33-402, Idaho Code, except that when the appraised value of the property is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), one (1) single notice by publication shall be sufficient and the property shall be sold by sealed bids or at public auction.
    The board of trustees may accept the highest bid, may reject any bid, or reject all bids. If the real property was donated to the school district the board may, within a period of one (1) year from the time of the appraisal, sell the property without additional advertising or bidding. Otherwise, the board of trustees must have new appraisals made and again publish notice for bids, as before. During the sealed bid or public auction process, no real property of the school district can be sold for less than its appraised value. If, thereafter, no satisfactory bid is made and received, the board may proceed under its own direction to sell and convey the property for the highest price the market will bear.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of trustees may sell personal property, with an estimated value of less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), without appraisal, by sealed bid or at public auction, provided that there has been not less than one (1) published advertisement prior to the sale of said property. If the property has an estimated value of less than five hundred dollars ($500), the property may be disposed of in the most cost-effective and expedient manner by an employee of the district empowered for that purpose by the board, provided however, such employee shall notify the board prior to disposal of said property.

        This section was amended by two 1993 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 327, § 15, in the third paragraph of subdivision 6. substituted “council” for “auditor”. Prior to the amendment, the paragraph read: “One (1) copy of the report of the audit shall be filed with the legislative auditor, and one (1) copy shall be filed with the state department of education, after its acceptance by the board of trustees, but not later than October 15;”. However, ch. 387, § 6 deleted the portion of the paragraph which contained the word “auditor”. Therefore, the paragraph is set out above as amended by ch. 387, § 6.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 387, § 6, in the first paragraph of subdivision 6. deleted “each year,” following “To cause to be made”; deleted “of all” following “a full and complete audit”; substituted “statements” for “transactions” following “of the financial”; substituted “as required in section 67-450B, Idaho Code” for “, and of the activity or student body funds, except that in elementary school districts such audit shall be made at intervals of not more than two (2) years. Any audit shall be made by and under the direction of the board of trustees by an independent auditor, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and procedures”; in the third paragraph of subdivision 6. added “audit” following “One (1) copy of the”; deleted “of the audit” preceding “shall be filed”; and deleted “with the legislative auditor, and one (1) copy shall be filed” preceding “with the state department of education,”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 1 (1st E.S.), effective January 1, 2006, deleted the former second sentence of Paragraph 9, which read: “Revenue derived from maintenance and operation levies made pursuant to section 33-802 2, Idaho Code, shall be excluded from budget adjustments as provided in this paragraph”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 169, inserted “investments permitted by sections 67-1210 and 67-1210A, Idaho Code” in subsection 2.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 160, in subsection (6), in the third paragraph, substituted “November 10” for “October 15” in the first sentence, added the last two sentences, and added the last paragraph.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the board of trustees has approved and ordered payment of salaries, wages, or other claims against the school district, and the same is not paid by regular bank check, the clerk of the board of trustees shall issue a school district warrant, or order for warrant drawn against the appropriate fund, and shall sign the same.

     <p>
      The clerk of the board of trustees of any elementary school district with less than six (6) teachers within the district shall execute an order for warrant or warrants in duplicate, and present the same to the county auditor of the county, or of the home county, in which the district lies. The county auditor shall thereupon issue his warrant drawn against the school district fund as shown by the order for warrant.
     </p>
     <p>
      All warrants so issued shall be presented to the treasurer of the school district for payment by the persons holding the same. If there is insufficient money to the credit of the fund on which the warrant is drawn, the treasurer shall endorse on the back of said warrant, “Not paid for want of funds” and hand the same to the person presenting the warrant for payment. Warrants so endorsed by the treasurer shall bear interest at a rate to be specified by the board of trustees of the school district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Warrants issued by, or in behalf of, any school district shall be paid in the order of their issuance from funds accruing for the year in which they are issued. After all outstanding indebtedness for general school purposes for any one (1) year has been paid, any balance in the general school fund for that year shall be transferred to a warrant redemption fund for payment of any registered warrants. Where there is no outstanding indebtedness for general school purposes, nor any registered warrants, any such balance may be used for the payment of current expenses for the next fiscal year.

As a representative body, members of the Legislature desire to be responsive and responsible to these citizens. For this reason, the Legislature herewith submits an advisory ballot to the electors of the state of Idaho, and the results will guide the Legislature as to whether the three-tenths of one percent property tax previously contained in Section 33-802, Idaho Code, and levied against the market value of taxable property in the school districts for maintenance and operation purposes of school districts should continue to be removed and the funds be replaced by a sufficient increase in the state sales tax.

        “The Secretary of State shall have the question below placed on the 2006 general election ballot and shall take necessary steps to have the results on the question tabulated. The question shall be as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        ’Should the State of Idaho keep the property tax relief adopted in August 2006, reducing property taxes by approximately $260 million and protecting funding for public schools by keeping the sales tax at 6%?’.

      The board of trustees of any school district may create and establish a school plant facilities reserve fund by resolution adopted at any regular or special meeting of the board. All moneys for said fund accruing from taxes levied under section 33-804, Idaho Code, together with interest accruing from the investment of any moneys in the fund and any moneys allowed for depreciation of school plant facilities as are appropriated from the general fund of the district, shall be credited by the treasurer to the school plant facilities reserve fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Disbursements from said fund may be made from time to time as the board of trustees may determine, for purposes authorized in section 33-1102, Idaho Code, and for lease and lease purchase agreements for such purposes and to repay loans from commercial lending institutions extended to pay for the construction of school plant facilities, but no expenditure for remodeling existing buildings shall be authorized and made unless the estimated cost thereof shall exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000). Lease purchase agreements shall not extend beyond the period designated for any existing school plant facilities reserve fund levy. Expenditures may also be made from this fund for participation by the school district in any local improvement district in which the school district may be situate, but any such participation shall not create a lien upon any of the property owned by the school district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should any school district having a balance in its school plant facilities reserve fund be consolidated with one or more school districts to form a new school district, the moneys in such fund shall be used to retire any bonds issued by it and outstanding at the time of the consolidation. If there are no bonds outstanding, any balance in its school plant facilities reserve fund shall accrue to the new district to be added to or to create and establish a school plant facilities reserve fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should any school district having a balance in its school plant facilities reserve fund be divided so as to create two (2) or more new districts the said fund may be used to retire any bonds issued by it and outstanding at the time of the division, or the said fund may be divided among the new school districts, as may be approved by the electors at the time of the division. If the fund is divided among the new districts, a school plant facilities reserve fund is thereby created and established for each district.

     <p>
      The board of trustees of any school district having a school plant facilities reserve fund created and established under any of the provisions of this section, may discontinue the same by resolution adopted at any regular meeting of the board. Upon such discontinuance, any balance in the fund shall be used to retire any outstanding bonds, if any; otherwise, the balance may be transferred to the general fund of the district.

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2006, ch. 311 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature hereby finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and
    “(e) Require each school district to annually set aside an adequate amount of moneys for the exclusive purpose of school building maintenance in order to arrest deterioration in school facilities that have lead to unsafe conditions and to provide a sliding scale of state match subsidies for this amount based upon the school district’s relative ability to pay.”

       Pursuant to section 33-906B, Idaho Code, school districts with a value index below one (1) shall be eligible to receive additional state financial assistance for the cost of annual bond interest and redemption payments made on bonds passed on or after September 15, 2002. However, any school district with a value index of less than one and one-half (1.5), shall receive no less than ten percent (10%) of the interest cost portion of the annual bond interest and redemption payment for bonds passed on or after September 15, 2002. The state department of education shall disburse such funds to school districts from moneys appropriated from the bond levy equalization fund. The department shall disburse the funds by no later than September 1 of each year for school districts in which voters have approved the issuance of qualifying bonds by no later than January 1 of that calendar year, and which are certifying a qualifying bond interest and redemption payment for the fiscal year in which the disbursement is made. For districts with a value index below one (1), the percentage of each annual bond interest and redemption payment that is paid by the state shall be determined by dividing the difference between one (1) and the school district’s value index by one (1).

       For the purposes of this section, the annual bond interest and redemption payment shall be determined by dividing the total payment amounts by the number of fiscal years in which payments are to be made. The interest cost portion of the annual bond interest and redemption payment shall be determined by dividing the total interest paid by the number of fiscal years in which payments are to be made. For school districts not qualifying for a state payment in the first year of the bond interest and redemption payment schedule, due solely to the January 1 eligibility deadline, the state department of education shall distribute an additional payment in the next fiscal year, in the amount of such funds that the school district would have otherwise qualified for in the current fiscal year.

      <li id="t33c09s33-906ol13">
       The provisions of this section may not be utilized to refinance existing debt or subsidize projects previously subsidized by state grants, unless the existing debt being refinanced is a bond passed on or after September 15, 2002; provided however, that any school district that has issued qualifying bonds prior to June 30, 2004, in conformance with this section shall not be deemed to be refinancing existing debt when the qualifying bonds are utilized to finance the acquisition of public school facilities previously leased or financed through means other than the issuance of general obligation bonds approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote at an election called for that purpose subject to subsection (5) of this section.

This adjustment shall apply for the duration of the bond interest and redemption payment schedule. If a school district advantaged by this subsection (6) deconsolidates either during the applicable bond interest and redemption payment schedule, or within a three (3) year period thereafter, each deconsolidated district shall, upon deconsolidation, repay to the bond levy equalization fund all additional subsidies received pursuant to this subsection (6). The proportions owed by each deconsolidated district shall be determined by the proportion that each district’s market value for assessment purposes bears to the whole.

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2006, ch. 311 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature hereby finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution.

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2006, ch. 311 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature hereby finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
    “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
    “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) Require each school district to annually set aside an adequate amount of moneys for the exclusive purpose of school building maintenance in order to arrest deterioration in school facilities that have lead to unsafe conditions and to provide a sliding scale of state match subsidies for this amount based upon the school district’s relative ability to pay.”

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2006, ch. 311 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature hereby finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
    “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and

       School districts and public charter schools may establish career technical schools that qualify for funding appropriated for the specific purpose of supporting the added cost of career technical schools. These funds will be appropriated to the state board for career technical education, to be expended by the division of career technical education. In order for a school to qualify for funding as a career technical school, it must make application to the division of career technical education on or before the fifteenth of April for the following fiscal year. This includes applicants for new schools and renewal applications. Approved public charter schools with career technical education programs will receive the same added cost unit as any other eligible school on an actual approved cost basis not to exceed the per-student cost for a traditional instructional delivery method. All career technical schools must meet all three (3) of the following criteria:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33c10s33-1002Gol11a">
         The school serves students from two (2) or more high schools. No one (1) high school can comprise more than eighty-five percent (85%) of the total enrolled career technical school students. In the event a student enrolled in the career technical school is not enrolled in a public high school, the eighty-five percent (85%) will be calculated based on the public high school attendance area where the student resides. This provision does not exclude a public charter school with a statewide boundary from applying for appropriate added cost funds authorized for career technical education, irrespective of the instructional delivery method.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c10s33-1002Gol11b">
         The majority of the school’s program offerings lead to some form of postsecondary credit, such as dual credit or other advanced opportunities, as defined by the state board of education, or include apprenticeship opportunities.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c10s33-1002Gol11c">
         All school programs offer at least one (1) supervised field experience for all students.

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 1998, ch. 261 provided: “Legislative Intent. There is growing consensus that public schools need to better adapt to today’s workplace demands by providing curriculum and experiences that closely align themselves to the reality of the workplace. The emerging professional-technical skills center approach has been shown to accomplish this end. These schools are intended to serve students of all ability levels, including the gifted and talented. Courses are typically aligned with higher education and have a field experience component. Equipment is more attuned to current industry standards and students from more than one high school access the centers. These centers always exceed the costs associated with a ‘regular’ high school and this factor has discouraged their widespread utilization. Idaho is no exception. This act provides a modest increase in per student funding over the regular secondary school units. It is the intent of the legislature in providing this increase to help cover the additional skill center costs of lower teacher-pupil ratios, transportation, equipment and field experience supervision.”

      In order to acquire and maintain technology for individualized computer and/or distance learning programs, a school district may use students’ documented contact hours on individualized computer education or distance learning programs in determining the district’s average daily attendance, whether the student is actually in the computer lab or distance learning center, or has logged on to the computer from another location. A district’s technology instruction programs shall be subject to the following provisions:

       The certification requirements for an alternative school using the individualized computer education or distance learning program may be met by having a properly certificated teacher available on a consultant tutorial basis. The consultant tutors will be available by telephone, fax, e-mail, or in person at the school site on a daily basis.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c10s33-1003Col12">

       Districts may offer individualized computer education or distance learning programs on a calendar which may differ from the rest of the district’s instruction, but in no case may a district claim more average daily attendance for a student than the full-time equivalency of a regular term of attendance for a single student.

If the support units used to calculate discretionary funding pursuant to sections 33-1009 and 33-1018, Idaho Code, are at least three percent (3%) greater, seventy-five percent (75%) of the difference shall be added to the support units used for the February 15 apportionment of state funds;

       (8) A district may utilize a portion of the instructional staff allowance provided for in this section for kindergarten teachers to visit the parents or guardians of students during the first week of the kindergarten school year. Such visits may take place at school, at the student’s home or at another location agreed to by the teacher and parents or guardians. The purpose of such visits is to help strengthen the working relationship between the teacher, the parents or guardians, and the student. The visits should be used as an opportunity to help establish the teacher’s expectations of the student. The visit should also provide an opportunity for the parents or guardians to explain their expectations. The amount of moneys to be expended for such visits by the district may not exceed the amount equal to one (1) week of instructional staff allowance computed for kindergarten instructors in the district.

    (6) To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. If the district does not employ any administrative staff, the district administrative index shall equal the statewide average index for purposes of calculating administrative salary-based apportionment. The district administrative staff index shall be multiplied by the base salary of thirty-eight thousand seventeen dollars ($38,017). The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section 33-1004(4), Idaho Code.

In doing so, the state board of education may set a new limit that is greater than one hundred three percent (103%), but is less than the percentile limit requested by the school district. However, the percentage increase in the one hundred three percent (103%) cap shall not exceed the percentage of the district’s bus runs that qualify as a hardship bus run, pursuant to this subsection. Any costs above the new level established by the state board of education shall not be reimbursed. Such a change shall only be granted by the state board of education for hardship bus runs. To qualify as a hardship bus run, such bus run shall meet at least two (2) of the following criteria:

    4. If the full amount appropriated to the public school income fund from the general account by the legislature is not transferred to the public school income fund by the end of the fiscal year, the deficiency resulting therefrom shall either be restored or reduced through a special transfer from the general account in the first sixty (60) days of the following fiscal year, or shall be calculated in computing district levies, and any additional levy shall be certified by the state superintendent of public instruction to the board of county commissioners and added to the district’s maintenance and operation levy. If the deficiency is restored or reduced by special transfer, the amount so transferred shall be in addition to the amount appropriated to be transferred in such following fiscal year and shall be apportioned to each school district in the same amount as each would have received had the transfer been made in the year the deficiency occurred. The state department of education shall distribute to the school district the full amount of the special transfer as soon as practical after such transfer is made. In making the levy computations required by this subsection the state department of education shall take into account and consider the full amount of money receipted into the public school income fund from all sources for the given fiscal year. Deficits in the transfer of the appropriated amount of general account revenue to the public school income fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that the total amount receipted from other sources into the public school income fund exceeds the official estimated amount from those sources. The official estimate of receipts from other sources shall be the total amount stated by the legislature in the appropriation bill. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any transfers to or from the public education stabilization fund.

At a minimum, the school district shall be required to repay in each fiscal year succeeding the year of the loan an amount no less than the lottery proceeds that the school district would otherwise receive for that fiscal year and additional foundation support moneys, if any, accruing as a result of an initial overestimation of state average daily attendance support units and later distribution of residual amounts resulting from fewer support units than originally estimated. The loan shall provide for the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund, or the budget stabilization fund, to the extent that it was the source of the loan, to intercept the lottery proceeds that would otherwise go to the school district until the loan is fully repaid. In addition, the state treasurer may impose reasonable fiscal conditions on the school district during the term of loan repayment including, but not limited to, restrictions in use of otherwise unrestricted school district moneys to assist in repayment of the loan or in abatement of unsafe or unhealthy conditions, the declaration of a financial emergency during some or all of the term of repayment of the loan, or interception by the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund of a portion of the state foundation program payments under chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code, that would otherwise go to the school district to repay the loan.

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2006, ch. 311 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature hereby finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
    In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) Require each school district to annually set aside an adequate amount of moneys for the exclusive purpose of school building maintenance in order to arrest deterioration in school facilities that have lead to unsafe conditions and to provide a sliding scale of state match subsidies for this amount based upon the school district’s relative ability to pay.”

       Amendments.
      </h5>
      <p>
       This section was amended by two 2007 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2007 amendment, by ch. 142, in the introductory paragraph in subsection (1), in the first sentence, substituted “shall annually allocate moneys for school building maintenance” for “shall annually deposit to a school building maintenance fund moneys” and “receipt of state funds” for “deposit of state funds,” added the second sentence, and in the last sentence, substituted “to be allocated for school building maintenance as follows” for “to be deposited into the school building maintenance fund as follows”; in the introductory paragraph in subsection (3), in the first sentence, substituted “Moneys allocated for school building maintenance” for “Moneys in a school district’s building maintenance fund,” and inserted “or any serious or imminent safety hazard on the property of said school buildings as identified pursuant to chapter 80, title 39, Idaho Code,” in the second sentence, substituted “maintenance allocation” for “maintenance fund,” and added “and shall remain allocated for the purposes specified in this subsection (3),” and added the fourth sentence; in subsection (3)(b), substituted “fund sources allocated for school building maintenance and any unexpended allocations carried forward” for “fund sources deposited into the school district’s school building maintenance fund and the fund balance carried forward”; in subsections (3)(c) and (3)(d), substituted “maintenance allocation” for “maintenance fund”; in subsection (3)(c), deleted “from the fund” from the end; in subsection (3)(d), deleted “monies in” following “uses of”; inserted “regularly” in subsection (4)(a); and added subsection (4)(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2007 amendment, by ch. 354, substituted “eighty-one dollars and forty-five cents” for “eighty dollars” in the introductory paragraph in subsection (3).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2009 amendment, by ch. 169, updated the internal reference in the next-to-last sentence in subsection (3); and added subsections (4), (5), and (7), redesignating the other subsections accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2012 amendment, by ch. 66, substituted “the third Friday in December” for “December 1” at the end of the introductory paragraph in subsection (6).

       Legislative Intent.
      </h5>
      <p>
       Section 1 of S.L. 2006, ch. 311 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature hereby finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
    “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
      </p>
      <p>
       In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
    “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) Require each school district to annually set aside an adequate amount of moneys for the exclusive purpose of school building maintenance in order to arrest deterioration in school facilities that have lead to unsafe conditions and to provide a sliding scale of state match subsidies for this amount based upon the school district’s relative ability to pay.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1 of S.L. 2009, ch. 169 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) Every dollar spent on energy costs in an Idaho public school is a dollar that is not spent in the direct education of students in the classroom. As energy costs increase, the diversion of funding away from the classroom will accelerate. The state has a primary interest in minimizing K-12 public school building energy costs since funding for energy comes directly from the state General Fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) School districts recognize that funding will always be limited and that efficient use of every dollar is vital to providing the highest possible level of educational services. It is apparent that designing and constructing more energy efficient buildings accrue cumulative benefits to both the state and to the school district. This is because any energy efficiency built into a new school building will save money each and every year of operation for the life of that school building. Small gains in energy efficiency result in large payoffs over the life of operations of a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) This act provides an incentive for school districts to use certain design and construction processes for constructing high quality school buildings. Using two processes, integrated design and fundamental commissioning, will result in efficient design and construction implementation of higher performance new public school buildings. Using this design and construction process, it is the intent of this act to make energy efficiency a priority for our school districts in the design and construction of new public school buildings.”

     <p>
      School district bonds shall be issued in denominations to be determined by the board of trustees.
     </p>
     <p>
      No school district bonds shall be issued except upon an amortization plan. The first amortized principal payment shall mature and be payable not more than two (2) years from and after the date of the bonds, and the various annual maturities of any issue of bonds shall be in such principal amounts as will, together with accruing interest on all outstanding bonds of such issue, be met and paid by an equal annual tax levy during the term for which such bonds shall be issued and shall satisfy one (1) of the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t33c11s33-1107ol11">
       The annual tax levy in any year shall not exceed by more than ten percent (10%) the average annual tax levy if the principal and interest coming due on the bonds was repaid in equal annual amounts; or

       The annual tax levy in any year shall not exceed by more than ten percent (10%) the average annual tax levy if the principal and interest coming due on the bonds, together with the principal and interest coming due on all other outstanding bonds of the school district, was repaid in equal annual amounts; or
      </li>
      <li id="t33c11s33-1107ol13">
       The annual tax levy shall result in the repayment of principal and interest coming due on the bonds, or the bonds, together with the principal and interest coming due on all other outstanding bonds of the school district, more rapidly than an equal annual tax levy.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Whenever the amortization plan does not satisfy any of the foregoing alternatives, the board of trustees may adopt such amortization plan as it shall find will result to the benefit and advantage of the district, and the board of trustees may issue and sell such bonds with such annual maturities as it shall determine either prior to or after the fixing of the interest rates such bonds will bear, and in every such instance it shall be permissible for the board of trustees to issue such bonds in the annual maturities so determined upon and bearing the rate or rates of interest ascertained upon the sale of such bonds, and the plan and form thereof together with the contract, if any, for the issue must be approved by the state superintendent of public instruction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of this section, bonds may be issued as serial or term bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each bond shall bear interest from the date of issue, payable semiannually on the days of such months as shall be determined by the board of trustees, at such interest rate as said board may determine. Each bond of any issue shall be numbered in a consecutive series. Each issue of bonds shall mature and be paid in full not more than thirty (30) years from the date of the bonds.

      No issue of school bonds shall at any time be sold at less than its aggregate par value.

      School bonds may be sold at private sale, as provided in section 57-232, Idaho Code, after notice as hereinafter provided, or may be sold at public sale as hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of the intention to sell such bonds at public or private sale shall be published once in the name of the issuer in a newspaper of general circulation within the issuer’s boundaries at least three (3) days prior to the time scheduled by the issuer for approving the sale of such bonds. Failure to comply with this requirement shall not invalidate the sale of the bonds, so long as the issuer has made a good faith effort to comply.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the bonds are sold at public sale, the notice shall describe the issue of bonds; shall state that the board of trustees will receive sealed bids or electronic bids pursuant to the provisions of section 57-233, Idaho Code, until a specified day and hour; and that said bids will be accepted or rejected at a regular or special meeting of the board at a time and place to be named in the notice. Said notice may require such deposits of forfeits as the board may deem necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the meeting held at the time and place named in the notice, the board of trustees shall open the bids, and may sell the same to whomever shall make the bid most advantageous to the school district, and the deposits of the unsuccessful bidders shall thereupon be returned to them. Should the successful bidder fail or refuse to tender payment of the amount required for the purchase of the issue within ten (10) days after tender to him of the executed bonds and a certified copy of the bond proceedings, his deposit shall be forfeited; and the board may in its judgment accept the bid next most advantageous, readvertise the issue as before, or sell the bonds at private sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of trustees may reject any or all bids, and sell the bonds at private sale when this is found to be in the best interest of the district.

In all cases the net interest cost shall be computed without regard to any option of redemption prior to the designated maturities.

       Proceedings to revoke or suspend any certificate issued under section 33-1201, Idaho Code, or to issue a letter of reprimand or place reasonable conditions on the certificate shall be commenced by a written complaint against the holder thereof. Such complaint shall be made by the chief certification officer stating the ground or grounds for issuing a letter of reprimand, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or for revocation or suspension and proposing that a letter of reprimand be issued, reasonable conditions be placed on the certificate, or the certificate be revoked or suspended. A copy of the complaint shall be served upon the certificate holder, either by personal service or by certified mail, within thirty (30) days of determination by the executive committee or such other time agreed to by the teacher and the chief certification officer.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c12s33-1209ol13">
       Not more than thirty (30) days after the date of service of any complaint, the person complained against may request, in writing, a hearing upon the complaint. Any such request shall be made and addressed to the state superintendent of public instruction; and if no request for hearing is made, the grounds for suspension, revocation, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or issuing a letter of reprimand stated in the complaint shall be deemed admitted. Upon a request for hearing, the chief certification officer shall give notice, in writing, to the person requesting the hearing, which notice shall state the time and place of the hearing and which shall occur not more than ninety (90) days from the request for hearing or such other time agreed to by the teacher and the chief certification officer. The time of such hearing shall not be less than five (5) days from the date of notice thereof. Any such hearing shall be informal and shall conform with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. The hearing will be held within the school district in which any teacher complained of shall teach, or at such other place deemed most convenient for all parties.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c12s33-1209ol14">
       Any such hearing shall be conducted by three (3) or more panel members appointed by the chairman of the professional standards commission, a majority of whom shall hold a position of employment the same as the person complained against. One (1) of the panel members shall serve as the panel chair. The panel chair shall be selected by the chairman of the professional standards commission from a list of former members of the professional standards commission who shall be instructed in conducting administrative hearings. No commission member who participated in the probable cause determination process in a given case shall serve on the hearing panel. All hearings shall be held with the object of ascertaining the truth. Any person complained against may appear in person and may be represented by legal counsel, and may produce, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and, if he chooses to do so, may submit for the consideration of the hearing panel a statement, in writing, in lieu of oral testimony, but any such statement shall be under oath and the affiant shall be subject to cross-examination.

       The state superintendent of public instruction, as authorized by the state board of education, has the power to issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses and compel the production of pertinent papers, books, documents, records, accounts and testimony. The state board or its authorized representative may, if a witness refuses to attend or testify or to produce any papers required by such subpoena, report to the district court in and for the county in which the proceeding is pending, by petition, setting forth that a due notice has been given of the time and place of attendance of the witnesses, or the production of the papers, that the witness has been properly summoned, and that the witness has failed and refused to attend or produce the papers required by this subpoena before the board, or its representative, or has refused to answer questions propounded to him in the course of the proceedings, and ask for an order of the court compelling the witness to attend and testify and produce the papers before the board. The court, upon the petition of the board, shall enter an order directing the witness to appear before the court at a time and place to be fixed by the court in the order, the time to be not more than ten (10) days from the date of the order, and then and there shall show cause why he has not attended and testified or produced the papers before the board or its representative. A copy of the order shall be served upon the witness. If it shall appear to the court that the subpoena was regularly issued by the board and regularly served, the court shall thereupon order that the witness appear before the board at the time and place fixed in the order and testify or produce the required papers. Upon failure to obey the order, the witness shall be dealt with for contempt of court. The subpoenas shall be served and witness fees and mileage paid as allowed in civil cases in the district courts of this state.

       Within twenty-one (21) days of the conclusion of any hearing dealing with the revocation, suspension, denial of a certificate, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or issuing a letter of reprimand, the hearing panel shall submit to the chief certification officer, to the person complained against and to the chief administrative officer of the public school employing the certificate holder, if any, a concise statement of the proceedings, a summary of the testimony, and any documentary evidence offered, together with the findings of fact and a decision. The hearing panel may determine to suspend or revoke the certificate, or the panel may order that reasonable conditions be placed on the certificate or a letter of reprimand be sent to the certificate holder, or if there are not sufficient grounds, the allegation against the certificate holder is dismissed and is so recorded.
    (7) Within three (3) days of issuance, the hearing panel’s decision shall be made a permanent part of the record of the certificate holder. Should the final decision be to place reasonable conditions upon the certificate holder or a suspension or revocation of the teaching certificate, the professional standards commission must notify the employing public school of the hearing panel’s decision and to provide notice that such may negatively impact upon the employment status of the certificated employee.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The allegation shall state the specific ground or grounds for the allegation of unethical conduct that could lead to a possible revocation, suspension, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or issuance of a letter of reprimand. Upon receipt of a written and signed allegation of unethical conduct, the chief certification officer, in conjunction with the attorney general and the professional standards commission investigator, shall conduct a review of the allegation using established guidelines to determine whether to remand the issue to the school district to be resolved locally or to open an investigation and forward the case to the professional standards commission. Within fourteen (14) days of the decision to forward the case, the chief certification officer shall notify the complainant and the teacher, in writing, that an investigation will be conducted and the teacher shall be afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegation verbally and in writing prior to the issuance of the complaint. The executive committee of the professional standards commission shall review the circumstances of the forwarded case at one (1) of the two (2) next regularly scheduled meetings, and determine whether probable cause exists to warrant the filing of a complaint and the requesting of a hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) The final decision of the hearing panel shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, in the district court of the county in which the holder of a revoked certificate has been last employed as a teacher.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) Whenever any certificate has been revoked, suspended or has had reasonable conditions placed upon it, or an application has been denied, the professional standards commission may, upon a clear showing that the cause constituting grounds for the listed actions no longer exists, issue a valid certificate. Provided however, that no certificate shall be issued to any person who has been convicted of any crime listed in subsection (2) of section 33-1208, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (10) For any person certified in another state and applying for certification in Idaho, and for any person previously certified in this state who is applying for certification in the event their certification has lapsed or is seeking renewal of a current certification, the chief certification officer shall deny an application for a new certificate or for a renewal of a certificate, regardless of the jurisdiction where such certificate was issued, if there are any unsatisfied conditions on such current or previously issued certificate or if there is any form of pending investigation by a state agency concerning the applicant’s teaching license or certificate. Provided however, the chief certification officer shall not automatically deny the application if such person authorized in writing that the chief certification officer and the professional standards commission shall have full access to the investigative files concerning the conditions on, or investigation concerning, such certificate in Idaho or any other state or province. Upon review of the information authorized for release by the applicant, the chief certification officer shall either grant or deny such application or, upon denial and upon written request made by the applicant within thirty (30) days of such denial, shall afford the applicant with the procedures set forth in subsections (3) through (9) of this section. If the applicant does not execute the written authorization discussed herein, reapplication may be made once all investigations have been completed and all conditions have been satisfied, resulting in a clear certificate from the issuing state or province.
     </p>
     <p>
      (11) For the purposes of this section, the term “teacher” shall include any individual required to hold a certificate pursuant to section 33-1201, Idaho Code.

       At the beginning of each new employment year and thereafter as necessary during the employment year, each noncertificated employee of any school district, including charter districts, who regularly works twenty (20) hours or more per week or certificated employee who works half time or more per week for a school district, including charter districts, shall be entitled to sick leave with full pay of one (1) day, as projected for the employment year for each month of service in which they work a majority portion of that month, subject to the limitations provided by this chapter. Sick leave for noncertificated employees shall be calculated proportionate to the average hours worked per day. Sick leave for certificated employees shall be calculated by the day, or percentage thereof, as defined in their individual employment contracts. The local board of trustees shall not provide compensation for unused sick leave. This shall not prohibit the local board of trustees from establishing a policy providing retirement severance pay.

       Each local board of trustees may establish a policy governing leave for certificated and noncertificated employees in the case of absence during a period for which the employee is paid by worker’s compensation. In addition the board may supplement the worker’s compensation payment by an amount not to exceed an amount which when combined with the worker’s compensation payment would be equal to the amount the employee would have been paid if he had not been injured. Supplementation may come from accrued vacation leave, compensatory time or sick leave time as may be provided in the policy of the district. Time for which a person is paid worker’s compensation shall not be allowed as straight sick leave which would result in duplicate compensation.

       (d) The board of trustees of any school district, including any specially chartered district, may also grant a leave of absence to any certificated employee of such district for service to a professional educational organization of which such certificated employee is a member and has been elected to hold the office of president therein, such leave to be for a period not exceeding one (1) year. During the period of any such leave of absence the said certificated employee shall receive the same compensation and receive or accrue such other rights and benefits that he would have been entitled to or have received or accrued had he been present and working for the school district, and he shall remain an active member of the public employee retirement system of Idaho; provided that such professional educational organization shall first pay to the said school district an amount equal to any and all compensation, contributions to the public employee retirement system of Idaho and any other amounts paid to or accrued in the name of said employee during such period.

      Unused sick leave shall accrue from year to year as long as an employee remains continuously in the service of the same school district, including charter districts. Termination of employment in any district shall terminate sick leave rights, both current and accrued, except when such employee is employed by a public education entity or by a state educational agency, as such terms are defined in section 67-5302, Idaho Code, during the school year immediately following the year of termination or within three (3) school years immediately following the year of termination if termination of employment is due to a reduction in force; and the accrued sick leave shall be secured for, and credited to, the employee by the public education entity or state educational agency thereafter employing such employee. Any state educational agency employee or public education entity employee who obtains employment with a school district during the current or subsequent school year following termination shall be credited any unused sick leave accrued during state employment. Whenever new school districts are formed by the consolidation or by the division of existing districts, the accrued sick leave of school district employees who continue in service in the new district or districts created by such consolidation or division shall have such accrued sick leave secured for and credited to them in such newly created district or districts.

      <li id="t33c12s33-1228ol11">
       Upon separation from public school employment by retirement in accordance with chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code, an employee’s unused sick leave shall be determined based on accumulated sick leave earned subsequent to July 1, 1976, as provided by section 33-1218, Idaho Code, and shall be reported by the employer to the Idaho public employee retirement system. A sum equal to one-half (½) of the monetary value of such unused sick leave, calculated at the rate of pay for such employee during the employee’s highest year of salary used in the average monthly salary, as determined by the retirement board, shall be transferred from the sick leave account provided by subsection (3) of this section and shall be credited to such employee’s retirement account. Such sums shall be used by the retirement board to continue to pay, subject to applicable federal tax limits:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33c12s33-1228ol11a">
         Premiums for the retiree and the retiree’s dependents at the rate for the active employee’s group health, long-term care, vision, prescription drug and dental insurance programs as maintained by the employer for the active employees until the retiree and/or the retiree’s spouse becomes eligible for medicare at which time the district shall make available a supplemental program to medicare for the eligible individual. Upon the death of the retiree, the surviving spouse’s health coverage shall be available and continued under the same terms and conditions as the retiree. Coverage may be continued for the retiree’s surviving dependent spouse and dependents until remarriage of the spouse or until the retiree’s surviving dependent spouse is eligible for a group health program by an employer. The medicare supplement program will provide the same premium and benefits for all retirees of all the employers served by the same insurance carrier. However, a school district may make available to all retirees from that district other benefits in addition to the medicare supplement program, and the retiree or the district shall pay for such additional benefits.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c12s33-1228ol11b">
         Premiums at the time of retirement for the retiree for the life insurance program maintained by the employer which may be reduced to a minimum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) of coverage.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t33c12s33-1228ol12">
       The retiree may continue to pay the premiums for the health, accident, dental and life insurance to the extent of the funds credited to the employee’s account pursuant to this section, and when these funds are expended, the premiums may be deducted from the retiree’s allowance. Upon a retiree’s death, any unexpended sums remaining in the retiree’s account shall revert to the sick leave account. If funds are not available for payment by the Idaho public employee retirement system from the retiree’s surviving dependent spouse’s allowance, the insurance carrier shall implement a direct billing procedure to permit the retiree’s surviving spouse to continue coverage.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c12s33-1228ol13">
       Each employer shall contribute to a sick leave account maintained by the public employee retirement system in trust exclusively for the purpose of the provisions of this section. The retirement board shall serve as trustee of the trust and shall be indemnified to the same extent as provided in section 59-1305, Idaho Code. Assets in the trust shall not be assignable or subject to execution, garnishment or attachment or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law. The rate of such contribution each pay period shall consist of a percentage of employees’ salaries as determined by the board, and such rate shall remain in effect until next determined by the board. Any excess balance in the sick leave account shall be invested, and the earnings therefrom shall accrue to the sick leave account except the amount required by the board to defray administrative expenses. Assets of the trust may be commingled for investment purposes with other assets managed by the retirement board. All moneys payable to the sick leave account are hereby perpetually appropriated to the board and shall not be included in its departmental budget.
    (4) For purposes of this section public school employment shall be defined to include the employees of the Idaho digital learning academy, and to permit inclusion of employees of organizations funded by school districts or of contributions of employees of school districts and shall include employees of the Idaho bureau of educational services for the deaf and the blind.

        Cost of Living Provision.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where, in a written negotiation agreement with the teachers’ bargaining unit, the board of trustees of a school district had agreed to provide a cost of living increase based upon the consumer price index each year when sound fiscal management allowed it, and the evidence showed that in a year when the consumer price index was up approximately 11%, the board offered the teachers a cost of living increase of only 7.5% (even though there was more than enough money available to the board to fund a full 11% increase), the evidence clearly supported the court’s finding that the board did not negotiate the cost of living adjustment in good faith as required by this section. Gilbert v. Nampa School Dist. No. 131, 104 Idaho 137, 657 P.2d 1 (1983).
    Where the school district’s board of trustees had contractual and statutory duties to negotiate and to provide teachers a cost of living increase based upon the consumer price index if certain conditions were met, it was within the authority of the district court to determine whether the board complied with these duties. Gilbert v. Nampa School Dist. No. 131, 104 Idaho 137, 657 P.2d 1 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section required a school district’s board of trustees to enter into a negotiation agreement with the teachers’ association, nothing in the statutes required the board to agree to the inclusion of a cost of living provision in that agreement; therefore, the board’s promise to provide cost of living increases if certain economic conditions were met was not unenforceable as resulting from forced negotiations.

        Effect of Agreements on Contracts.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A school board, currently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations or in mediation with the association representing its teachers, may send out binding individual contracts to teachers as required by statute, and those contracts become and are modified by applicable provisions of the agreement which thereafter results from negotiations and mediation which were timely brought and on-going when the individual contracts were entered into.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the terms of a collective bargaining agreement may not be settled and reduced to a written binding contract at the time of the proffering of individual teacher contracts is immaterial, since the school boards and teachers may offer and accept employment subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement yet to be agreed upon by the parties.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature hereby finds that interpreting services in Idaho public schools, kindergarten through grade twelve (12), for students who are deaf, hard of hearing or deaf-blind need to be improved. The absence of state standards for evaluating educational interpreters allows for inconsistencies in the delivery of educational information to students who are in need of such services. The legislature recognizes that educational interpreters in Idaho public schools must not only interpret the spoken word but must also convey concepts and facilitate the student’s understanding of the educational material. The legislature also finds that among the many factors that influence student success, there is a correlation between the academic achievements of deaf, hard of hearing and deaf-blind students and the competency of their interpreters. Therefore, the legislature finds that Idaho educational public policy is served by establishing standards for persons employed in the Idaho public schools as educational interpreters.

The pupil’s parent or guardian must apply annually for admission to a school within another district, or to another school within the home district, on a form provided by the state department of education. The application, accompanied by the pupil’s accumulative record, must be submitted to the receiving school district by February 1 for enrollment during the following school year, and notice of such application given to the home district. The receiving school district, or the receiving school within the home district, shall notify the applicant within sixty (60) days and, if denied, must include written explanation of the denial. Upon agreement between the resident and the nonresident school boards, or between the affected schools within the home district, the deadlines for application may be waived. Whenever any pupil enrolls in, and attends a school outside the district within which the parent or guardian resides, the parent or guardian shall be responsible for transporting the pupil to and from the school or to an appropriate bus stop within the receiving district. For students attending another school within the home district, the parent or guardian is responsible for transporting the pupil to and from an appropriate bus stop. Tuition shall be waived for any pupils allowed under the provisions of this section.

     <p>
      Every school district shall receive and admit pupils transferred thereto, where payment of their tuition is to be paid by the home district, or waived by the receiving district, except when any such transfer would work a hardship on the receiving district. Each receiving school district shall be governed by written policy guidelines, adopted by the board of trustees, which define hardship impact upon the district or upon an individual school within the district. The policy shall provide specific standards for acceptance and rejection of applications for accepting out of district pupils. Standards may include the capacity of a program, class, grade level or school building. Standards may not include previous academic achievement, athletic or other extracurricular ability, disabling conditions, or proficiency in the English language.

     <p>
      Nonresident pupils who are placed by court order under provisions of the Idaho juvenile corrections or child protective acts and reside in licensed homes, agencies and institutions shall be received and admitted by the school district in which the facility is located without payment of tuition.

     <p>
      Homeless children and youth as defined by the McKinney-Vento homeless assistance act 42 U.S.C. section 11301 et seq., may attend any school district or school within a district without payment of tuition when it is determined to be in the best interest of that child.

       <p>
        The 1990 amendment, by ch. 43, § 3, in the first sentence of the first paragraph, after “a hardship on the receiving district” deleted, “but no district shall be required to accept and admit secondary school pupils who have not completed the grades given in their home districts, nor pupils who have failed in any of their home district classes in the year next preceding the proposed transfer”; added the second, third and fourth sentences to the first paragraph; and designated the former second sentence as the present second paragraph.
    The 1990 amendment, by ch. 272, § 1, designated the former second sentence as the present second paragraph; at the end of the second paragraph inserted “without payment of tuition”; and added the third paragraph.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 235, in the last sentence in the first paragraph, substituted “disabling conditions” for “handicapping conditions”; and in the last paragraph, substituted “defined by the McKinney-Vento homeless assistance act 42 U.S.C. section 11301 et seq.” for “defined by the Stewart B.

      33-1405. Rates of tuition — Tuition certificates.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state department of education shall prepare and distribute all necessary forms; and shall issue to each school district, annually, a tuition certificate bearing a serial number, which certificate shall authorize the receiving district to charge and to bill for the tuition of its nonresident pupils where tuition has not been waived.
     </p>
     <p>
      In determining tuition rates to be charged by any creditor school district, the state department of education shall compute the sum of that district’s maintenance and operation costs, depreciation on its buildings, equipment, and other property, and the interest, if any paid by it on bonded debt or registered warrants. The said state department of education shall then compute what proportion of the sum of said costs, depreciation and interest is allocable to elementary schools, and what proportion is allocable to secondary schools, in the district. The proportion allocable to elementary schools shall then be divided by the average daily attendance of elementary school pupils, and the proportion allocable to secondary schools shall be divided by the average daily attendance of secondary school pupils, in the district, and the amount so determined shall be the gross per-pupil cost, elementary or secondary, as the case may be. The net per-pupil cost shall be the gross per-pupil cost less the per-pupil apportionment to the district of any foundation program funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Computations of tuition rates shall be made as of the school year next preceding the year for which tuition charges are determined and made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Charges for tuition made by any creditor school district shall be its net per-pupil cost, as hereinabove defined; except that its gross per-pupil cost shall be charged where any pupil has transferred to the creditor district by transfer other than one prescribed by section 33-1403, Idaho Code, or where the home district of any pupil attending school in the creditor district is without the state of Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of trustees of a school district may request a waiver from the state board of education of any portion of the tuition rate determined pursuant to this section. A waiver request must be made for each individual student, and may be requested for up to four (4) years, subject to annual review by the local board of trustees. Waivers must be requested before April 1 of the year prior to the operative date.

     <p>
      To afford more equal opportunity for public school attendance, the board of trustees of each district, including specially chartered school districts, shall, where practicable, provide transportation for the public school pupils within the district, and pupils resident within adjoining districts annually agreed to in writing by the districts involved, under conditions and limitations herein set forth. Nonpublic school students may be transported, where practicable, when the full costs for providing such transportation are recovered. In approving the routing of any school bus, or in the maintenance and operation of all such transportation equipment, or in the appointment or employment of chauffeurs, the primary requirements to be observed by the board of trustees are the safety and adequate protection of the health of the pupils. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any board of trustees from denying transportation to any pupil in any school bus operated by or under the authority of said board, upon good cause being given, in writing, to the parents or guardian, or either of them, of such pupil.
     </p>
     <p>
      No board of trustees shall be required to provide transportation for any pupil living less than one and one-half (1 ½) miles from the nearest appropriate school. A board of trustees may require pupils who live less than one and one-half (1 ½) miles from the nearest established bus stop to walk or provide their own transportation to such bus stop. That distance shall be determined by the nearest and best route from the junction of the driveway of the pupil’s home and the nearest public road, to the nearest door of the schoolhouse he attends, or to the bus stop, as the case may be. The board may transport any pupil a lesser distance when in its judgment the age or health or safety of the pupil warrants.
     </p>
     <p>
      A day care center, family day care home, or a group day care facility, as defined in section 39-1102, Idaho Code, may substitute for the student’s residence for student transportation to and from school. School districts may not transport students between child care facilities and home. Student transportation between a child care facility and a school will qualify for state reimbursement providing that the child care facility is one and one-half (1 ½) miles or more from the school to which the student is transported.
     </p>
     <p>
      To effectuate the public policy hereby declared, the board of trustees of any school district may purchase or lease, and maintain and operate school buses and vans, which vans shall not have a seating capacity in excess of fifteen (15) persons; may enter into agreements or contracts for the use of a charter bus or buses; may enter into contracts with individuals, firms, corporations or private carriers; or may make payments to parents or guardians, subject to the limitations herein provided, when transportation is not furnished by the district.

        The allocation of state funds to several school districts pursuant to this section (prior to the 1985 amendment), for the purposes of transportation of the parochial students, the effect of which would be to aid the school was prohibited under the provisions of Idaho Const., Art. IX, § 5. Epeldi v. Engelking, 94 Idaho 390, 488 P.2d 860 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1972).

        The statutory requirements in this chapter and the school district’s response to those requirements through the compilation and adoption of safety rules and regulations were intended to impact primarily upon the safety and adequate protection of the health of the pupils in the transportation of school pupils; in short, the safety rules were designed to prevent accidents in the transportation of pupils.

        Where uncontroverted evidence indicated that the district provided a convenience shuttle bus program as a courtesy only, the district assumed a duty to provide safe shuttle busing to those who chose to ride, but it did not assume a duty to see that the riders’ walk home was a safe one.

      33-1608. Family life and sex education — Legislative policy.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho believes that the primary responsibility for family life and sex education, including moral responsibility, rests upon the home and the church and the schools can only complement and supplement those standards which are established in the family. The decision as to whether or not any program in family life and sex education is to be introduced in the schools is a matter for determination at the local district level by the local school board of duly selected representatives of the people of the community. If such program is adopted, the legislature believes that:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t33c16s33-1608ol1a">
       a. Major emphasis in such a program should be to assist the home in giving them the knowledge and appreciation of the important place the family home holds in the social system of our culture, its place in the family and the responsibility which will be there much later when they establish their own families.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1608ol1b">
       b.

      33-1612. Thorough system of public schools.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The constitution of the state of Idaho, section 1, article IX, charges the legislature with the duty to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools. In fulfillment of this duty, the people of the state of Idaho have long enjoyed the benefits of a public school system, supported by the legislature, which has recognized the value of education to the children of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In continuing recognition of the fundamental duty established by the constitution, the legislature finds it in the public interest to define thoroughness and thereby establish the basic assumptions which govern provision of a thorough system of public schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      A thorough system of public schools in Idaho is one in which:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1612ol11">

       Educators are empowered to maintain classroom discipline;
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1612ol13">
       The basic values of honesty, self-discipline, unselfishness, respect for authority and the central importance of work are emphasized;
      </li>

       The skills necessary to communicate effectively are taught;
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1612ol15">
       A basic curriculum necessary to enable students to enter academic or professional-technical postsecondary educational programs is provided;

     <p>
      The state board shall adopt rules, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and section 33-105(3), Idaho Code, to establish a thorough system of public schools with uniformity as required by the constitution, but shall not otherwise impinge upon the authority of the board of trustees of the school districts. Authority to govern the school district, vested in the board of trustees of the school district, not delegated to the state board, is reserved to the board of trustees. Fulfillment of the expectations of a thorough system of public schools will continue to depend upon the vigilance of district patrons, the dedication of school trustees and educators, the responsiveness of state rules, and meaningful oversight by the legislature.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2010, ch. 275 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to provide a variety of avenues to help Idaho students succeed in school. The Legislature’s duty to maintain a thorough system of public schools is only strengthened by employing new and innovative approaches to help ensure that more young people successfully complete grades 1-12 curriculum prepared for good-paying careers, postsecondary educational success or both. Idaho’s economic future rests on the ability of an educated workforce to excel in today’s complex and demanding workplace. To help ensure student success, the Legislature believes that a Pilot Program, a revenue neutral Pilot Program, designed to permit students to successfully complete school curriculum at their own accelerated pace, is warranted to study the efficacy of such an approach.”

      <li id="t33c16s33-1625ol11">
       The state board of education and the Idaho high school activities association shall provide access to appropriate guidelines and information that identify the signs and symptoms of a concussion and head injury and describe the nature and risk of concussion and head injury in accordance with standards of the centers for disease control and prevention through a link on the internet website of the board and the Idaho high school activities association.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1625ol12">
       This section shall apply to any middle school, junior high school and high school in the state participating in or administering an organized athletic league or sport. For the purposes of this section, “youth athlete” or “athlete” means an individual who is eighteen (18) years of age or younger and who is a participant in any middle school, junior high school or high school athletic league or sport.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1625ol13">
       At the beginning of each sports season before a youth athlete participates in any organized practice or game, the youth athlete and the youth athlete’s parent or guardian shall receive the guidelines and information described in subsection (1) of this section from the school for which the athlete plays, and shall review the guidelines and information. Coaches, referees, game officials, game judges and athletic trainers shall review such guidelines and information upon employment and biennially thereafter.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1625ol14">
       Schools shall obtain written consent from the youth athlete’s parent or guardian on an annual basis attesting to the fact that the youth athlete’s parent or guardian has received a copy of the concussion information and guidelines as outlined in subsection (3) of this section, acknowledges the inherent risk and authorizes the youth athlete to participate in athletic activity.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1625ol15">
       If during a practice or game or competition, it is reasonably suspected that a youth athlete has sustained a concussion or head injury and exhibits outward signs or symptoms of such, as defined by the centers for disease control and prevention, then the youth athlete shall be removed from play. Every Idaho middle school, junior high school and high school that participates in or offers an organized athletic league shall develop protocol to be followed for removing such athletes from play. Such protocol shall be consistent with concussion and head injury guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c16s33-1625ol16">
       An athlete may be returned to play once the athlete is evaluated and authorized to return by a qualified health care professional who is trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. For the purposes of this section, “qualified health care professional” means and includes any one (1) of the following who is trained in the evaluation and management of concussions:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33c16s33-1625ol16a">
         A physician or physician assistant licensed under chapter 18, title 54, Idaho Code;

       Students who have sustained a concussion and return to school may need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring by medical or academic staff until the student is fully recovered. A student athlete should be able to resume all normally scheduled academic activities without restrictions or the need for accommodation prior to receiving authorization to return to play by a qualified health care professional as defined in subsection (6) of this section.
    (8) If an individual reasonably acts in accordance with the protocol developed pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, then acting upon such protocol shall not form the basis of a claim for negligence in a civil action.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (9) Any youth sport organization or association in this state may comply with this section. If a youth sport organization or association is in full compliance with this section, then the youth sport organization or association shall be afforded the same protections from liability in a civil action pursuant to subsection (8) of this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of trustees of a community college district of an urban area, upon filing with the state board of education a notice of intent to exercise the powers herein granted, shall thereafter be authorized and empowered to organize and operate an upper division consisting of the third and fourth years of college curriculum with powers to grant baccalaureate degrees in liberal arts and sciences, business and education. Upper division courses and programs are subject to approval pursuant to section 33-107(8), Idaho Code. The operation of the community college and the upper division shall be kept separate; however, the joint use of facilities is authorized provided a proper cost allocation is made. The buildings and equipment for the use of said upper division may be purchased, leased, constructed, maintained, and administered from funds obtained by the board of trustees’ levy. Such levy shall not exceed two hundredths percent (.02%) of the market value for assessment purposes on all taxable property within the taxing district. Said board under section 33-2113, Idaho Code, may obtain capital funds through issuance of general obligation bonds for such equipment and buildings, with the total tax levy for operation and bonds of the upper division not to exceed the levy limit authorized in this section. Such tax shall be certified and levied as provided for other taxes of the district. All other costs of operation of said upper division shall be provided by tuition and fees paid by the student. Gifts and grants may be accepted by the board of trustees for this or other purposes. A student who has been a resident of the community college district pursuant to section 33-2110B, Idaho Code, for not less than one (1) year at time of admission to the upper division, or who has completed the first two (2) years in the college, shall be given preference for admission to the upper division.

The tuition shall be, as nearly as is practicable, the annual costs of all elements of providing the courses of instruction, including interest on general obligation bonds, teaching, administration, maintenance, operation and depreciation of equipment and buildings, supplies and fuel, and other ordinary and necessary expenses of operation incurred in providing courses by the community college, provided that the tuition of students residing outside the district but within the county or counties wherein the district is located shall be fixed after taking into account moneys received by the community college district from any funds allocated to the community college from the educational funds of the state of Idaho, other than allocations for career technical education; and provided that the tuition of students residing outside the district and the county but within the state of Idaho shall be fixed after taking into account moneys received from educational funds other than career technical moneys, as referred to in this chapter, from the state of Idaho. Receipt of moneys, as hereinbefore provided in this section, shall be based upon the receipts from the sources referred to during the fiscal year preceding the fixing of the tuition. A student in a community college shall not be deemed a resident of the district or of the county or of the state of Idaho, unless that student is deemed a resident as defined by section 33-2110B, Idaho Code, for the district, county or state prior to the date of his first enrollment in the community college, and no student who was not a resident of the district, county or state shall gain residence while attending and enrolled in the community college.

      <li id="t33c21s33-2110Aol11">
       Any student residing in the area of a county outside of a community college district or in a county without a community college district, who has been a resident of the county and state as defined by section 33-2110B, Idaho Code, immediately prior to the date of his first enrollment in a community college, which residence may not be acquired while attending and enrolled in a community college, may enroll in any community college in the state, and the county of his residence shall pay that portion of his tuition as hereinafter set out. The tuition which shall be paid by the resident county shall be that portion of the tuition uniformly established by a community college district for all out-of-district students, both in state as well as out of state, pursuant to section 33-2110, Idaho Code, after deducting therefrom the amount of tuition paid by a resident student at the community college; however, the liability of the resident county shall not exceed two-thirds (2/3) of the total tuition and fees charged and in no instance shall it exceed five hundred dollars ($500) each semester for a two (2) semester year for a full-time student. The student shall pay the tuition and fees charged a student resident in the district, and the balance, if any, of the out-of-district student tuition above the maximum liability of the county of his residence. No county shall be liable for out-of-district tuition unless the board of county commissioners of that county has first verified to the community college in writing the fact that the student is a resident of the county. Upon verification, the county shall thereafter be liable for the out-of-district tuition so long as the student is duly enrolled and attending the college subject to the following limitations:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33c21s33-2110Aol11a">
         Liability shall be the term of the curriculum for which the student is enrolled, with a maximum lifetime liability of three thousand dollars ($3,000). The three thousand dollar ($3,000) maximum is exclusive of any reimbursement to counties for county tuition from the state or other funds.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c21s33-2110Aol11b">
         Liability shall terminate if the student’s domiciliary residence changes and that change continues for twelve (12) months.

       To receive county payment of tuition, each out-of-district student taking community college courses shall complete a certificate of residency form and submit it to the county clerk of their resident county on or before December 1 of each year for classes taken during that fall semester, and on or before May 1 of each year for classes taken during that spring semester. Failure by a student to submit the certificate of residency form by these deadlines is sufficient grounds for denial of the certificate of residency by the county.

       Each county shall provide information regarding which students’ certificates of residency were approved to each community college on or before December 20 of each year for classes taken during that fall semester, and on or before May 20 of each year for classes taken during that spring semester.

Counties are not required to pay for classes that are billed past these deadlines. Invoices shall list the out-of-district tuition amount for each out-of-district student who was approved by the county of residency, and shall list only students still duly enrolled in the class past the community college’s drop deadline.

       Each board of county commissioners shall allow and order paid any timely submitted and proper invoice for tuition at a regular meeting following receipt of the invoice.

       (8) Based upon the enrollment established by the first semester’s tuition invoices received by January 20, the board of county commissioners shall establish immediately a total community college annual tuition budget for two (2) semesters which shall be equal to twice the amount of the tuition bills plus a contingency factor of ten percent (10%). This budget shall be adjusted after June 20 based on any change of enrollment shown by the second semester tuition bills. If enrollment is from zero to not more than four (4) students, a minimum budget of five (5) students at five hundred dollars ($500) each shall be established. In the event all tuition bills received have been paid, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (a) any liquor funds received, which in the quarter when received to any extent are in excess of the budget, to the extent of that excess shall not be paid over to the county treasurer to be held in the community college fund, and (b) any funds received from the levy on taxable property, which when received to any extent are in excess of the budget after the application of liquor funds thereto, to the extent of that excess shall not be paid over to the community college fund. Excess liquor funds shall be paid pursuant to law as if this section were not applicable and excess funds shall be paid to the general fund of the county. In the event the total liquor fund payable hereunder to the county community college fund together with the receipts from the levy on taxable property for each fiscal year are insufficient to pay tuition bills, which deficiency is caused by a levy of less than the maximum allowed hereunder, or by enrollment in excess of the budget herein provided, the budget for each following year shall be increased to the maximum allowed by the maximum tax levy authorized to pay any deficiency at the earliest time. If the deficiency is due to the lack of funds in a fiscal year when the maximum levy authorized shall have been made, for the next fiscal year thereafter the number of students from that county shall be limited by the board of county commissioners to the extent necessary to pay the deficiency not later than the end of the following year. A community college shall nevertheless have a right to require any student residing outside the district to pay out-of-district tuition if the county of his residence is more than twenty-five percent (25%) in arrears of a total county tuition bill for one (1) year as of the beginning of the subsequent semester, but tuition shall be refunded to such students when paid by the county.

      In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of, or relating to any contract of, the commission, the commission shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder, upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the board of trustees of a junior college district declaring the need for the commission. Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is such need for a commission and finds in substantially the foregoing terms (no further detail being necessary) that such conditions exist in the junior college district. A copy of such resolution, duly certified by the clerk, shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the board of trustees of a junior college district adopts a resolution as set forth in the preceding section, the clerk of said board shall promptly transmit a certified copy of said resolution to the governor of the state of Idaho, and the governor shall promptly thereafter appoint three (3) persons as commissioners of the commission created for said district. The governor shall certify to the clerk of the district the names of the persons so appointed, and the clerk shall notify said persons in writing of their appointment and the term for which each of them is appointed. The commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one (1), two (2) and three (3) years respectively, from the date of their appointment, but thereafter commissioners shall be appointed as aforesaid for a term of office of 3 years, except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term. No commissioner may be an officer of [or] employee of the junior college district for which the commission is created. A commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk, and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner. A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services for the authority in any capacity, but he shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers of each commission shall be vested in the commissioners thereof in office from time to time. Two (2) commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present. The by-laws of the commission shall designate which of the commissioners appointed shall be the first chairman, and such chairman shall serve in the capacity of chairman until the expiration of his term of office as commissioner. When the office of the chairman thereafter becomes vacant, the commissioners shall select a chairman from their number. The commissioners shall select from their number a vice-chairman, and may employ a secretary (who may be executive director), technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. The persons employed by the commission may be employees of the junior college district but shall not be trustees of the district. For such legal services as it may require, the commission may employ its own counsel. The commission may delegate to one (1) or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.

      A dormitory housing commission shall have power to issue bonds from time to time in its discretion, for any of its corporate purposes. A commission shall also have power to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying or retiring bonds previously issued by it. In order to carry out the purposes of this act, a commission may issue, upon proper resolution, bonds on which the principal and interest are payable (a) exclusively from the income and revenue of a dormitory project financed with the proceeds of such bonds; or (b) exclusively from such income and revenues together with grants and contributions from the federal government or other source in aid of such project; provided that the proceeds of grants of funds and moneys received or to be received from the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, pursuant to agreements entered into between the commission and the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof prior to the issuance of the bonds, may be considered as revenue of the project for which such bonds are issued.

     <p>
      Neither the commissioners nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of a commission (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt or liability, direct or indirect, of the junior college district, the state, or any political subdivision thereof, and neither the junior college district, the state or any political subdivision thereof, shall be liable thereon, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds other than those of the commission or funds due the commission. Bonds of a commission are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt from taxes.

Career technical education programs may be delivered by traditional, blended, or virtual models and must meet the required elements as outlined in the state standards for secondary programs. Virtual programs will utilize post-capstone interviews conducted by industry professionals to demonstrate technical proficiency and to satisfy face-to-face requirements. Interviews will be based on students’ needs and may be conducted face-to-face or electronically. History.

The state library board shall be maintained within the office of the state board of education and shall consist of the state superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent’s designee, as ex officio member, and five (5) members appointed by the state board of education. On the first Monday of July, 1998, the state board of education shall appoint one (1) member for a term of three (3) years, one (1) member for a term of four (4) years, and one (1) member for a term of five (5) years. Thereafter, the state board of education shall annually, on the first Monday of July, appoint one (1) member to the state library board to serve for a term of five (5) years.

      It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state of Idaho, as a part of the provisions for public education, to promote the establishment and development of free library service for all the people in Idaho. It is the purpose of this act to assure an informed electorate by enabling the provision of free local library service, in the present and in the future, to children in their formative years and to adults for their continuing education. To carry out the purpose of this act, an independent, nonpartisan board shall govern the library.

      Every library established in this chapter shall be forever free for the use of the residents of the city, always subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as the library board may find necessary to adopt.

      33-2615. System board of directors.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each regional system shall be governed by a board of directors, to be selected by and from the governing boards of the participating libraries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Initially, as the system is formed, each participating library shall be entitled to one (1) representative on the system board, and those libraries legally serving a population base of more than ten thousand (10,000) shall also be entitled to a second representative.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within two (2) weeks after receiving notice of approval of a petition for establishment, as provided for under this act, the board of each participating library shall select its representative or representatives, and certify the names and addresses of such representatives to the state librarian.
     </p>
     <p>
      As additional libraries, now or hereafter established, petition to join the system, the board shall not exceed twenty-five (25) in number. When the board members total twenty-five (25), or earlier with the unanimous agreement of the participating boards, the system board shall develop a plan for equitable rotation of trustees, while retaining representation from a library in each county. The designated headquarters for the system shall always have representation on the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      At their first meeting the members of the system board shall divide themselves by lot into terms of one (1) to five (5) years. Thereafter, all vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments, and appointments to complete an unexpired term shall be for the residue of the term only.
     </p>
     <p>
      No member of any system board shall serve on the system board for more than five (5) consecutive years, and in no event shall service on the system board exceed the term of office of the incumbent on the governing board of the participating library which he represents.
     </p>
     <p>
      The system board shall annually elect from its membership a chairman and such other officers as it may deem necessary to conduct the affairs of the system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Members of the system board may receive from the regional system their actual and necessary expenses while engaged in business of said system.

     <p>
      When the proposed library district embraces more than one (1) county, the petition and procedure for praying for the establishment of the district shall be carried forward in each county as though that county were the only county affected. Each petition shall designate the same home county for the proposed district.

      The board of county commissioners of the home county shall advise with the board of county commissioners in any other county affected to the end that the election shall be held in each county on the same day. The board of county commissioners in each county shall proceed in the conduct of the election as though the election were being held only in that county as set forth in section 33-2705, Idaho Code. After the canvass of the returns, the results in each other county shall be certified to the board of county commissioners of the home county, together with all ballots and tally sheets. The board of county commissioners of the home county shall canvass all returns and certify the results of the election to the board of county commissioners of any other county affected. The proposal shall be deemed approved only if a majority of all votes cast in each county were cast in the affirmative. If this is the case, the board of county commissioners of the home county shall enter an order declaring the library district to be created, designating its name and boundaries, including a map prepared in a draftsmanlike manner. A certified copy of the order shall be transmitted by the board of county commissioners to the county recorder, the county assessor and the state tax commission in a timely manner, but no later than December 15, in the calendar year in which the election was held. A copy of this order shall also be transmitted to the board(s) of county commissioners of any other county affected, which shall enter the order in its minutes. A copy of this order shall also be transmitted to the board of library commissioners.

       When a tax supported city library has voted to consolidate with a district library, the property tax portion of the new consolidated district’s first annual budget will be determined in the following manner.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c27s33-2710ol13">
       In any consolidation, the dollar amount of property taxes for the new consolidated district’s budget shall not exceed six hundredths percent (.06%) of the market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c27s33-2710ol14">
       In any consolidation, the existing bonded debt of any district or districts shall not become the obligation of the proposed consolidated library district. The debt shall remain an obligation of the property which incurred the indebtedness.

     <p>
      The property tax portion of each district’s most recent annual certified budget will be added together. The resulting figure will be considered the dollar amount of property taxes on which to base the first annual budget for the new consolidated district. The provisions of section 63-802, Idaho Code, shall be applied to this dollar amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      The city library budget figure will be defined as the budget for library services, whether from the general fund and/or the library fund, in the city’s annual certified budget in effect on the date the election was held, less fines, fees, and any other identifiable revenues from nontax sources, and any grants made directly to the city library board. The city library budget figure will be added to the property tax portion of the public library district’s annual certified budget in effect on the date the election was held. The resulting figure will be considered the dollar amount of property taxes on which to base the first annual budget for the new consolidated district. The provisions of section 63-802, Idaho Code, shall be applied to this dollar amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the city has established a dedicated library fund in effect on the date the election was held, those dollars will be removed from the city budget in the fiscal year in which the newly consolidated district begins to levy to provide library services.

If, upon the canvass of ballots, it is determined that the proposition has been approved, the board of county commissioners of the home county shall enter its order to that effect and transmit a copy of said order to the board of county commissioners in any other county affected, and said order shall by them be made a matter of record. When any library district is dissolved, all property and assets of the library district shall be disposed of by the board of county commissioners of the home county. Receipts from the sale of assets and all unpaid taxes, when collected, shall be first used to retire any indebtedness of the district. Any remainder shall be apportioned to the counties embraced in the library district in proportion to the assessed valuation of each which was included in the library district, and placed in the respective county general expense fund. If, after the application of the tax monies and sale proceeds, indebtedness remains, the board of county commissioners of the home county shall provide for the payment of the remaining indebtedness from special levies certified to each county in proportion to the assessed valuation of each which was included in the district. The tax shall be collected by each county and remitted to the home county for payment of the remaining indebtedness.

This appointment shall be made within sixty (60) days of the declaration of vacancy. In the event that the board of trustees fails to exercise their authority, appointments shall be made by the board of county commissioners of the home county in which the district is located within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the sixty (60) days allowed for trustees for this action.

They shall be revised, as necessary, to equalize population and to follow new electoral precinct boundaries following the publication of the report of each decennial census. In order for a library district to be divided into trustee zones, the board of trustees shall pass a motion declaring the district to be divided into trustee zones and providing a legal description of each trustee zone. The board of trustees shall transmit the motion along with the legal description of the trustee zones to the board or boards of county commissioners in the county or counties where the library district is contained and to the board of library commissioners.

If the board or boards of county commissioners do not reject the establishment of the trustee zones within the time limit specified, they shall be deemed to be in full force and effect. If a library district is contained in more than one (1) county, a motion of rejection adopted by one (1) board of county commissioners shall be sufficient to keep the trustee zone plan from going into effect.

The initial election of trustees for the trustee zones shall be for terms of four (4) years for two (2) trustees and thereafter their terms shall be for six (6) years, terms of six (6) years for two (2) trustees and thereafter their terms shall be for six (6) years, and a term of two (2) years for one (1) trustee and thereafter the term shall be for six (6) years, with each zone being assigned an initial term length by a random drawing of the numbers one (1) through five (5).

       Any tax levied for library district purposes shall be a lien upon the property against which the tax is levied. The board of trustees shall determine and levy a tax upon each dollar of assessed valuation of property within the district for the ensuing fiscal year as shall be required to satisfy all maturing bond, bond interest, and judgment obligations. For the maintenance and operation of the library district, the board of trustees may also levy upon the taxable property within the district a tax not to exceed six hundredths percent (.06%) of market value for assessment purposes. These levies shall be certified to the board of county commissioners of each county in which the district may lie, not later than the second Monday in September of each year.

       In the first year after establishment, the board of a district may, for the purpose of organization and to finance general preliminary expenses of the district and before making a tax levy, incur an indebtedness not exceeding in the aggregate a sum equal to six hundredths percent (.06%) on each one dollar ($1.00) of market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the district. To repay the organization indebtedness incurred, the board shall have authority to levy and collect an additional tax not to exceed two hundredths percent (.02%) per annum on each one dollar ($1.00) of market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the district. This additional levy shall not be used for any purpose other than repayment of the organizational indebtedness and interest thereon. This additional levy may be imposed for three (3) years.

       The board of trustees of a library district may establish a capital assets replacement and repair fund within the library district budget for which district moneys may be budgeted and carried over from year to year. Disbursements from the fund may be made as the board may determine to maintain, repair, or replace the capital assets of the district to remodel or repair any existing library building; to furnish and equip any existing library building; and to purchase or replace major appliances and vehicles necessary to maintain and operate the services of the district. Moneys from the capital assets replacement and repair fund may not be used for the purchase of land or to build new library facilities or to build additions to current library facilities. Moneys in the fund may be invested in the manner provided in section 57-127, Idaho Code. In any year in which there is a capital assets replacement and repair fund in a library district, the amount held in the fund shall be reported in the library district’s budget hearing announcement, along with a list of capital items which may eventually be replaced or repaired with moneys from the fund. The fund shall be included in the annual report filed with the board of library commissioners and in the audit required in section 33-2726, Idaho Code.

      Each school-community library district shall be governed by a board of trustees of five (5) members, who at the time of their selection and during their terms of office shall be qualified electors of the district.
     </p>

       Four (4) of the trustees shall be elected. The procedure for nomination and election of trustees shall be as provided for the nomination and election of trustees of a library district pursuant to this chapter. Each school-community public library district may be divided into four (4) trustee zones with each zone having approximately the same population. In order for a school-community public library district to be divided into trustee zones, the board of trustees shall pass a motion declaring the district to be divided into trustee zones and present a description of boundaries of each trustee zone. The board of trustees shall transmit the motion along with the boundaries of the trustee zones to the board or boards of county commissioners in the county or counties where the school-community public library district is contained. The board or boards of county commissioners shall have forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the motion and description to reject, by adoption of a motion, the establishment of trustee zones proposed by formal motion of the board of trustees of the school-community public library district. If the board or boards of county commissioners do not reject the establishment of the trustee zones within the time limit specified, the zones shall be deemed to be in full force and effect upon the next annual trustee election. If a school-community public library district is contained in more than one (1) county, a motion of rejection adopted by one (1) board of county commissioners shall be sufficient to keep the trustee zone plan from going into effect. A board of county commissioners shall notify the board of trustees in writing if a proposal is rejected.

       The fifth trustee of the school-community library district board shall be a member of the school district board and shall be appointed by the school district board from its members at the annual meeting of the school district board. In the case of division of the district into four (4) elected school-community public library trustee zones, this fifth trustee shall serve as a trustee member-at-large.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c27s33-2738ol13">
       The initial board, except for the fifth trustee who shall be appointed by the school board, shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners, and shall serve until the next annual election of trustees or until their successors are appointed and qualified.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If a proposal for the establishment of trustee zones is rejected by a board of county commissioners, the boundaries of the trustee zones, if any, shall return to the dimensions they were before the rejection. Trustee zones may be redefined and changed, but not more than once every two (2) years, after a new set of trustee zones are formally established and in full force and effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      All other matters relating to school-community library public district trustee zones shall be as provided in chapters 4 and 5, title 33, Idaho Code, relating to school district trustee zones.

       <p>
        A statute authorizing the board of regents of the University of Idaho as a corporation to issue bonds to be amortized over a thirty-year period from revenues accruing from project financed by bond proceeds does not violate the constitutional limitations on indebtedness of subdivisions of the state, since the board of regents is not within the scope of the constitutional limitation.

        Board of regents as it existed prior to 1913 was a body corporate and had implied power to sue and be sued. Action against them was not, in effect, an action against state.

       <p>
        Session Laws 1913, ch. 77, p. 328, made the state board of education the successor of the old board of regents of the University of Idaho and, whether or not an action could be maintained against such new board, the new board could, nevertheless, defend an action which had previously been instituted against the old board of regents.

       </p>
       <p>
        The state board of education acting as the board of regents of the University of Idaho is a constitutional corporation with granted powers and, while functioning within scope of its authority, is not subject to control or supervision of any other branch, board, or department of the state government, but is a separate entity, and may sue and be sued, with power to contract and discharge indebtedness, with right to exercise its discretion within the powers granted, without authority to contract indebtedness against the state, and in no sense is a claim against the regents one against the state.

        S.L. 1998, ch. 256, § 63 provides: “This act [which in part, added and repealed this section] shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 2000, provided the United States Congress has approved amendments to Section 5 of the Idaho Admission Bill, 26 Stat. L. 215, ch. 656, regarding sale or lease of school lands; and the state board of canvassers has certified that amendments to Sections 3, 4, 8 and 11 of Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Idaho have been adopted at the general election of 1998 regarding funds related to the public school endowment, disposition of school lands, and investing of permanent endowment funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Following the successful occurrence of the foregoing events, the governor shall issue a proclamation declaring that the described events have occurred and the dates of the events, and this act shall be in full force and effect on and after the date described.

       <p>
        “Upon enactment, the state controller shall transfer all fund balances from the improvement funds to the respective earnings reserve funds.”

       <p>
        The contingencies noted above concerning the effective date of S.L. 1998, ch. 256, have been met; therefore, that act is effective July 1, 2000.

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2016 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 25, substituted “division of career technical education” for “division of professional-technical education” twice in the third sentence in subsection (3).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 125, substituted “four (4) separate accounts” for “3 (three) separate accounts” in the introductory paragraph and added subsection (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 17, rewrote subsection (3), which formerly read: “An account designated the surplus stabilization account for Eastern Idaho Technical College, North Idaho College, College of Southern Idaho and College of Western Idaho shall consist of any other moneys made available through legislative transfers, appropriations or otherwise provided by law, or from any other governmental source. All such moneys shall be expended for the maintenance, use and support of Eastern Idaho Technical College, North Idaho College, College of Southern Idaho and College of Western Idaho. Such expenditures shall be made subject to legislative appropriation to Eastern Idaho Technical College, through the appropriation to the division of career technical education, and to the community colleges. Distribution of such moneys shall be based upon established practices for the allocation of moneys to Eastern Idaho Technical College through the division of career technical education, or the state board of education’s established practices for the allocation of moneys to the community colleges. Interest earned from the investment of moneys in this surplus stabilization account shall be retained in this surplus stabilization account.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2020 amendment, by ch. 34, substituted “three (3) separate accounts” for “four (4) separate accounts” near the end of the introductory paragraph and deleted former subsection (4), which read: “An account designated the community college start-up account shall consist of any other moneys made available through legislative transfers, appropriations or otherwise provided by law, or from any other governmental source. All such moneys shall be expended for the establishment, use and support of a community college in eastern Idaho. Distribution of such moneys shall be based upon voter approval of a community college district and appointment of a local board of trustees by the state board of education. Such expenditures shall be made subject to legislative appropriation to the state board of education. Interest earned from the investment of moneys in this community college start-up account shall be retained in this community college start-up account.”

        Section 3 of S.L. 1975, ch. 118, read: “It is hereby declared to be in the public interest of the state of Idaho, for the benefit and welfare of its people and in furtherance of education and learning that the powers of institutions to borrow under ‘The Educational Institutions Act of 1935’ be clarified and further elaborated in the furtherance of the credit of said institutions and to provide certainty and stability for the financing of approved projects other than by bonded indebtedness, thus ensuring advantageous flexibility to the management and development of said institutions and the availability of financing upon the best terms and rates available in consideration of the credit and economic feasibility of projects so funded. It is further declared that this act is the acknowledgment and clarification of powers to borrow and provide for repayment heretofore duly vested in said institutions and nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted to the prejudice or detriment of credit or loans outstanding on or closed or negotiated prior to the effective date hereof.”

       There is hereby created the Idaho archaeological survey, to be administered as a special cooperative program under the authority of the board of trustees of the Idaho state historical society and the board of regents of the university of Idaho. It is the policy of the state of Idaho that the archaeological resources recovered from within the state, and their associated documentation, be accorded long-term curation within the state to ensure their continued accessibility by the educational programs of the state universities and for the public benefit of the citizens of the state of Idaho. It is a policy of the state of Idaho that archaeological inventories conducted within the state be documented in a comprehensive database accessible by educational programs and for other public purposes consistent with the protection of these resources. The survey shall be the lead state entity for the compilation, coordination, preservation and dissemination of archaeological survey data and long-term curation of collections for Idaho. This information is to be acquired through field and laboratory investigations by the staff of the survey and through cooperative programs with other governmental and private agencies, including the educational programs at the state universities which recover, use and care for archaeological materials. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the established role of the state universities in archaeological research and educational programs using archaeological materials.

       There is hereby established an advisory board for the survey which shall consist of the following members: the Idaho state archaeologist, who shall be director of the survey and nonvoting chairman of the advisory board, the academic vice presidents of the university of Idaho, Idaho state university and Boise state university or their designated representatives; the governor of the state of Idaho or his designated representative; and a member of the public who shall be elected by a majority vote of the advisory board and who shall serve for a term of two (2) years. Should a vacancy occur in the public member position, the advisory board shall appoint a replacement to serve the remainder of the term. Members of the advisory board shall be compensated as provided in section 59-509(b), Idaho Code, which compensation shall be paid from the archaeological survey account created in section 33-3905, Idaho Code. A quorum of the advisory board shall be required to be present to conduct business.

In addition to any other principles or requirements which a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the commission from each party state shall be that the members representing such state shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge or affiliations be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education, lay and professional, public and non-public educational leadership. Of those appointees, one shall be the head of a state agency or institution, designated by the governor, having responsibility for one or more programs of public education. In addition to the members of the commission representing the party states, there may be not to exceed ten non-voting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one year. Such commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or persons concerned with educational administration.
    B. The members of the commission shall be entitled to one vote each on the commission. No action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission are cast in favor thereof. Action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners are present. The commission shall meet at least once a year. In its bylaws, and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the commission may delegate the exercise of any of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director, except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to Article IV and adoption of the annual report pursuant to Article III (J).

      D. The commission shall elect annually, from among its members a chairman, who shall be a governor, a vice chairman and a treasurer. The commission shall provide for the appointment of an executive director. Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the commission may deem appropriate shall be bonded in such amount as the commission shall determine. The executive director shall be secretary.
     </p>
     <p>
      E. Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director subject to the approval of the steering committee shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. The commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      F. The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any party jurisdiction, the United States, or any subdivision or agency of the aforementioned governments, or from any agency of two or more of the party jurisdictions or their subdivisions.

     <p>
      G. The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, foundation, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (F) of this Article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission. Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed, and the identity of the donor or lender.
    H. The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      I. The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.
     </p>

      J. The commission annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year. The commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.

It is NASDTEC’s intent to maintain the jurisdiction-specific requirements (JSRs) index as a current and accurate reflection of each member jurisdiction’s requirements. However, circumstances beyond the control of NASDTEC may, on occasion, inhibit the accuracy of the master index. Accordingly, it is recommended that users of the JSR index refer to member jurisdictions’ websites to confirm specific requirements. Further, it is understood that this interstate agreement and the JSR index are provided to facilitate the exchange of information and are not intended to supplant or supersede individual jurisdiction’s authority.

      Driven by the “Assumptions” identified in Article II of this document, as of October 2010, NASDTEC member jurisdictions recognize the complex nature of the interstate agreement and the public’s need for clear, accurate information when moving from one (1) member jurisdiction to another. Member jurisdictions agree to make “Levels of Licensure” and jurisdiction-specific requirements (JSRs) clear to each other and the public by completing and maintaining the JSR index. This index is intended to provide information to anyone seeking educator licensure in a member jurisdiction, whether prepared through a traditional or nontraditional pathway. It identifies specific requirements beyond the NASDTEC-identified “Minimum Essential Components” for educator preparation. A member jurisdiction’s laws and regulations in place at the time of application for licensure supersede information provided here.

     <p>
      The purpose of the program is to expand employment opportunities for resident students. Employment may be in jobs at accredited institutions of higher education or in approved off-campus jobs. Students with financial need or educational need are to benefit through the program, and to do so while gaining work experience. Accordingly, efforts should be made whenever possible to provide job opportunities to students which relate to their academic and career goals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds under this program may be used to pay up to eighty percent (80%) of earnings in on-campus jobs. Program funds may also be used to pay up to fifty percent (50%) of earnings for approved off-campus jobs where the jobs are directly related to the student’s course of academic study and the employer pays fifty percent (50%) of the earnings. Program funds may also be used to fund up to ten percent (10%) of the total match required for the federal college work study program. Idaho program funds used as match will be governed by federal college work study policy. However, institutional funds used for federal matching purposes shall not be less than the amount allocated for the prior year.

      Students may be employed either on-campus or off-campus at eligible accredited institutions of higher education, subject to the limitations expressed in this chapter. Employing organizations and agencies must be responsible and must have professional supervision. Discrimination by employers on the bases of sex, race, color, age, religion, national origin, marital status or disability is prohibited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Generally, employment which is allowable under the federal college work study program is also allowable under the Idaho program. This applies to both on-campus and off-campus employment, except that off-campus jobs for the program must be within Idaho. Likewise, employment which is not allowable under federal regulations is not eligible under the Idaho program.
     </p>
     <p>
      Opinions from federal officials as to the legitimacy of a particular job under the federal college work study program may be assumed to be applicable to the Idaho program. However, approval to use Idaho program funds for particular jobs should not be construed as permission to institutions to use federal work-study funds to employ students in such jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial aid office at the institution is responsible for ensuring that disbursements are made only for work performed in accordance with the written job description, with adequate supervision, and with proper documentation for the hours worked.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2017, ch. 69 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage and support schools in developing comprehensive science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) learning environments for their students by establishing criteria for schools to earn a STEM school designation that will serve as an indicator for parents and students who are looking for STEM school experiences in Idaho. A STEM designation will be based on evidence that the school will offer a rigorous, diverse, integrated and project-based curriculum to students, with the goal of preparing those students for post-secondary education, the workforce and citizenship”.

        Two 1994 acts, Chapters 229 and 234, purported to create a new Chapter 48 in Title 33. Chapter 229 was compiled as Title 33, Chapter 48 (§§ 33-4801 to 33-4808) while chapter 234 was designated by the compiler, through the use of brackets, as Title 33, Chapter 49 (§§ 33-4901 to 33-4906). The redesignation of the provisions enacted by S.L. 1994, Chapter 234 was made permanent by S.L. 2005, Chapter 25.

      The legislature hereby finds, determines, and declares that the state of Idaho recognizes the importance of applying technology to meet the public need for an improved, thorough, and seamless public education system for elementary and secondary education, education of the hearing or visually impaired, postsecondary and higher education, and public libraries. The legislature has funded technology infrastructure to enable the state’s public schools to have the necessary technology that supports student learning, but many districts are unable to maximize the technology infrastructure at the classroom level by adding digital content and curriculum.

     Reasons for Revision.
    </h5>
    <p>
     Reasons for Revision. The Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) replaces the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (UMIFA). The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved UMIFA in 1972, and 47 jurisdictions have enacted the act. UMIFA provided guidance and authority to charitable organizations within its scope concerning the management and investment of funds held by those organizations, UMIFA provided endowment spending rules that did not depend on trust accounting principles of income and principal, and UMIFA permitted the release of restrictions on the use or management of funds under certain circumstances. The changes UMIFA made to the law permitted charitable organizations to use modern investment techniques such as total-return investing and to determine endowment fund spending based on spending rates rather than on determinations of “income” and “principal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     UMIFA was drafted almost 35 years ago, and portions of it are now out of date. The prudence standards in UMIFA have provided useful guidance, but prudence norms evolve over time. The new Act provides modern articulations of the prudence standards for the management and investment of charitable funds and for endowment spending. The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA), an Act promulgated in 1994 and already enacted in 43 jurisdictions, served as a model for many of the revisions. UPIA updates rules on investment decision making for trusts, including charitable trusts, and imposes additional duties on trustees for the protection of beneficiaries. UPMIFA applies these rules and duties to charities organized as nonprofit corporations. UPMIFA does not apply to trusts managed by corporate and other fiduciaries that are not charities, because UPIA provides management and investment standards for those trusts.
    In applying principles based on UPIA to charities organized as nonprofit corporations, UPMIFA combines the approaches taken by UPIA and by the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (RMNCA). UPMIFA reflects the fact that standards for managing and investing institutional funds are and should be the same regardless of whether a charitable organization is organized as a trust, a nonprofit corporation, or some other entity.
    See
    Bevis Longstreth, Modern Investment Management and the Prudent Man Rule 7 (1986) (stating ‘[t]he modern paradigm of prudence applies to all fiduciaries who are subject to some version of the prudent man rule, whether under ERISA, the private foundation provisions of the Code, UMIFA, other state statutes, or the common law.”); Harvey P. Dale,
     Nonprofit Directors and Officers — Duties and Liabilities for Investment Decisions
     , 1994 N.Y.U. Conf. Tax Plan. 501(c)(3) Org’s. Ch. 4.
    </p>
    <p>
     UPMIFA provides guidance and authority to charitable organizations concerning the management and investment of funds held by those organizations, and UPMIFA imposes additional duties on those who manage and invest charitable funds. These duties provide additional protections for charities and also protect the interests of donors who want to see their contributions used wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
     UPMIFA modernizes the rules governing expenditures from endowment funds, both to provide stricter guidelines on spending from endowment funds and to give institutions the ability to cope more easily with fluctuations in the value of the endowment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, UPMIFA updates the provisions governing the release and modification of restrictions on charitable funds to permit more efficient management of these funds. These provisions derive from the approach taken in the Uniform Trust Code (UTC) for modifying charitable trusts. Like the UTC provisions, UPMIFA’s modification rules preserve the historic position of the attorneys general in most states as the overseers of charities.
    </p>
    <p>
     As under UMIFA, the new Act applies to charities organized as charitable trusts, as nonprofit corporations, or in some other manner, but the rules do not apply to funds managed by trustees that are not charities. Thus, the Act does not apply to trusts managed by corporate or individual trustees, but the Act does apply to trusts managed by charities.
    </p>
    <h5 id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTE-prudentmanagementandinvestment">
     Prudent Management and Investment.
    </h5>
    <p>
     Among the expressly enumerated prudence factors in UPMIFA is “the preservation of the endowment fund,” a standard not articulated in UMIFA.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to identifying factors that a charity must consider in making management and investment decisions, UPMIFA requires a charity and those who manage and invest its funds to:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol11">
      Give primary consideration to donor intent as expressed in a gift instrument,
     </li>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol12">
      Act in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person would exercise,
     </li>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol13">
      Incur only reasonable costs in investing and managing charitable funds,
     </li>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol14">
      Make a reasonable effort to verify relevant facts,
     </li>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol15">
      Make decisions about each asset in the context of the portfolio of investments, as part of an overall investment strategy,
     </li>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol16">
      Diversify investments unless due to special circumstances, the purposes of the fund are better served without diversification,
    7. Dispose of unsuitable assets, and
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     8. In general, develop an investment strategy appropriate for the fund and the charity.
    </p>
    <p>
     UMIFA did not articulate these requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, UPMIFA strengthens the rules governing management and investment decision making by charities and provides more guidance for those who manage and invest the funds.

      Historic dollar value fixes valuation at a moment in time, and that moment is arbitrary. If a donor provides for a gift in the donor’s will, the date of valuation for the gift will likely be the donor’s date of death. (UMIFA left uncertain what the appropriate date for valuing a testamentary gift was.) The determination of historic dollar value can vary significantly depending upon when in the market cycle the donor dies. In addition, the fund may be below historic dollar value at the time the charity receives the gift if the value of the asset declines between the date of the donor’s death and the date the asset is actually distributed to the charity from the estate.
     </li>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol22">
      After a fund has been in existence for a number of years, historic dollar value may become meaningless. Assuming reasonable long term investment success, the value of the typical fund will be well above historic dollar value, and historic dollar value will no longer represent the purchasing power of the original gift. Without better guidance on spending the increase in value of the fund, historic dollar value does not provide adequate protection for the fund. If a charity views the restriction on spending simply as a direction to preserve historic dollar value, the charity may spend more than it should.
     </li>
     <li id="t33c49s33-4906-PREFATORYNOTEol23">
      The Act does not provide clear answers to questions a charity faces when the value of an endowment fund drops below historic dollar value. A fund that is so encumbered is commonly called an “underwater” fund. Conflicting advice regarding whether an organization could spend from an underwater fund has led to difficulties for those managing charities. If a charity concluded that it could continue to spend trust accounting income until a fund regained its historic dollar value, the charity might invest for income rather than on a total-return basis. Thus, the historic dollar value rule can cause inappropriate distortions in investment policy and can ultimately lead to a decline in a fund’s real value. If, instead, a charity with an underwater fund continues to invest for growth, the charity may be unable to spend anything from an underwater endowment fund for several years. The inability of a charity to spend anything from an endowment is likely to be contrary to donor intent, which is to provide current benefits to the charity.
    The Drafting Committee concluded that providing clearly articulated guidance on the prudence rule for spending from an endowment fund, with emphasis on the permanent nature of the fund, would provide the best protection of the purchasing power of endowment funds.

    <p>
     Relation to Trust Law. Although UPMIFA applies a number of rules from trust law to institutions organized as nonprofit corporations, in two respects UPMIFA creates rules that do not exist under the common law applicable to trusts. The endowment spending rule of Section 4 and the provision for modifying a small, old fund in subsection (d) of Section 6 have no counterparts in the common law or the UTC. The Drafting Committee believes that these rules could be useful to charities organized as trusts, and the Committee recommends conforming amendments to the UTC and the Principal and Income Act to incorporate these changes into trust law.

        Subsection (1). Charitable Purpose.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (1). Charitable Purpose. The definition of charitable purpose follows that of UTC § 405 and Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 28 (2003). This long-familiar standard derives from the English Statute of Charitable Uses, enacted in 1601.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some 17 states have created statutory definitions of charitable purpose for various purposes.
    See, e.g.
    , 10 PA. CONS. STAT. § 162.3 (2005) (defining charitable purpose within the Solicitation of Funds for Charitable Purposes Act to include “humane,” “patriotic,” “social welfare and advocacy,” and “civic” purposes). The definition in subsection (1) applies for purposes of this Act and does not affect other definitions of charitable purpose.

        Subsection (2). Endowment Fund.
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p class="">
    Subsection (2). Endowment Fund. An endowment fund is an institutional fund or a part of an institutional fund that is not wholly expendable by the institution on a current basis. A restriction that makes a fund an endowment fund arises from the terms of a gift instrument. If an institution has more than one endowment fund, under Section 3 [§ 33-5003] the institution can manage and invest some or all endowment funds together. Section 4 and Section 6 [§ 33-5004 and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t33c50s33-5006" target="_self">§ 33-5006</a></cite>] must be applied to individual funds and cannot be applied to a group of funds that may be managed collectively for investment purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Board-designated funds are institutional funds but not endowment funds. The rules on expenditures and modification of restrictions in this Act do not apply to restrictions that an institution places on an otherwise unrestricted fund that the institution holds for its own benefit. The institution may be able to change these restrictions itself, subject to internal rules and to the fiduciary duties that apply to those that manage the institution.
       </p>
       <p>
        If an institution transfers assets to another institution, subject to the restriction that the other institution hold the assets as an endowment, then the second institution will hold the assets as an endowment fund.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div>
       <h5 id="t33c50s33-5002-OFFICIALCOMMENT-subsection(3)giftinstrument">
        Subsection (3). Gift Instrument.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (3). Gift Instrument. The term gift instrument refers to the records that establish the terms of a gift and may consist of more than one document. The definition clarifies that the only legally binding restrictions on a gift are the terms set forth in writing.
       </p>
       <p>
        As used in this definition, “record” is an expansive concept and means a writing in any form, including electronic. The term includes a will, deed, grant, conveyance, agreement, or memorandum, and also includes writings that do not have a donative purpose. For example, under some circumstances the bylaws of the institution, minutes of the board of directors, or canceled checks could be a gift instrument or be one of several records constituting a gift instrument. Although the term can include any of these records, a record will only become a gift instrument if both the donor and the institution were or should have been aware of its terms when the donor made the gift. For example, if a donor sends a contribution to an institution for its general purposes, then the articles of incorporation may be used to clarify those purposes. If, in contrast, the donor sends a letter explaining that the institution should use the contribution for its “educational projects concerning teenage depression,” then any funds received in response must be used for that purpose and not for broader purposes otherwise permissible under the articles of incorporation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Solicitation materials may constitute a gift instrument. For example, a solicitation that suggests in writing that any gifts received pursuant to the solicitation will be held as an endowment may be integrated with other writings and may be considered part of the gift instrument. Whether the terms of the solicitation become part of the gift instrument will depend upon the circumstances, including whether a subsequent writing superseded the terms of the solicitation. Each gift received in response to a solicitation will be subject to any restrictions indicated in the gift instrument pertaining to that gift. For example, if an initial gift establishes an endowment fund, and the charity then solicits additional gifts “to be held as part of the Charity X Endowment Fund,” those additional gifts will each be subject to the restriction that the gifts be held as part of that endowment fund.
    The term gift instrument includes matching funds provided by an employer or some other person. Whether matching funds are treated as part of the endowment fund or otherwise will depend on the terms of the matching gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        The term gift instrument also includes an appropriation by a legislature or other public or governmental body for the benefit of an institution.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div>
       <h5 id="t33c50s33-5002-OFFICIALCOMMENT-subsection(4)institution">
        Subsection (4). Institution.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (4). Institution. The Act applies generally to institutions organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes. The term includes charitable organizations created as nonprofit corporations, unincorporated associations, governmental subdivisions or agencies, or any form of entity, however organized, that is organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes. The term includes a trust organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes, but only if a charity acts as trustee. This approach leaves unchanged the coverage of UMIFA. The exclusion of “individual” from the definition of institution is not intended to exclude a corporation sole.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although UPMIFA does not apply to all charitable trusts, many of UPMIFA’s provisions derive from trust law. Prudent investor standards apply to trustees of charitable trusts in states that have adopted UPIA. Trustees of charitable trusts can use the doctrines of
    cy pres
    and deviation to modify trust provisions, and the UTC includes a number of modification provisions. The Uniform Principal and Income Act permits allocation between principal and income to facilitate total-return investing. Charitable trusts not included in UPMIFA, primarily those managed by corporate trustees and individuals, will lose the benefits of UPMIFA’s endowment spending rule and the provision permitting a charity to apply cy pres, without court supervision, for modifications to a small, old fund. Enacting jurisdictions may choose to incorporate these rules into existing trust statutes to provide the benefits to charitable funds managed by corporate trustees.
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of institution includes governmental organizations that hold funds exclusively for the purposes listed in the definition. A governmental entity created by state law may fall outside the definition on account of the form of organization under which the state created it. Because state arrangements are so varied, creating a definition that encompasses all charitable entities created by states is not feasible. States should consider applying the core principles of UPMIFA to such governmental institutions. For example, the control over a state university may be held by a State Board of Regents. In that situation, the state may have created a governing structure by statute or in the state constitution so that the university is, in effect, privately chartered. The Drafting Committee does not intend to exclude these universities from the definition of institution, but additional state legislation may be necessary to address particular situations.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div>
       <h5 id="t33c50s33-5002-OFFICIALCOMMENT-subsection(5)institutionalfund">
        Subsection (5). Institutional Fund.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (5). Institutional Fund. The term institutional fund includes any fund held by an institution for charitable purposes, whether the fund is expendable currently or subject to restrictions. The term does not include a fund held by a trustee that is not an institution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some institutions combine assets from multiple funds for investment purposes, and some institutions invest funds from different institutions in a common fund. Typically each fund is assigned units representing the share value of the individual fund. The assets are invested collectively, permitting more efficient investment and improved diversification of the overall portfolio. The collective fund makes annual distributions to the individual funds based on the units held by each fund. For purposes of Section 3 [§ 33-5003] (and Section 5 [§ 33-5005]), the collective fund is considered one institutional fund. Section 4 and Section 6 [§ 33-5004 and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t33c50s33-5006" target="_self">§ 33-5006</a></cite>] apply to each fund individually and not to the collective fund.
    Assets held by an institution primarily for program-related purposes rather than exclusively for investment are not subject to UPMIFA. For example, a university may purchase land adjacent to its campus for future development. The purchase might not meet prudent investor standards for commercial real estate, but the purchase may be appropriate because the university needs to build a new dormitory. The classroom buildings, administration buildings, and dormitories held by the university all have value as property, but the university does not hold those buildings as financial assets for investment purposes. The Act excludes from the prudent investor norms those assets that a charity uses to conduct its charitable activities, but does not exclude assets that have a tangential tie to the charitable purpose of the institution but are held primarily for investment purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        A fund held by an institution is not an institutional fund if any beneficiary of the fund is not an institution. For example, a charitable remainder trust held by a charity as trustee for the benefit of the donor during the donor’s lifetime, with the remainder interest held by the charity, is not an institutional fund. However, this subsection treats as an institution a charitable remainder trust that continues to operate for charitable purposes after the termination of the noncharitable interests. The Act will have only a limited effect on a charitable remainder trust that terminates after the noncharitable interest ends. During the period required to complete the distribution of the trust’s property, the prudence norm will apply to the actions of the trustee, but the short timeframe will affect investment decision making.
       </p>

      <div>
       <h5 id="t33c50s33-5002-OFFICIALCOMMENT-subsection(6)person">
        Subsection (6). Person.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (6). Person. The Act uses as the definition of person the definition approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. The definition of institution uses the term person, but to be an institution a person must be organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes. A person with a commercial purpose cannot be an institution. Thus, although the definition of person includes “business trust” and “any other. .. commercial entity,” the Act does not apply to an entity organized for business purposes and not exclusively for charitable purposes. Further, the definition of person includes trusts, but only trusts managed by charities can be institutional funds. UPMIFA does not apply to trusts managed by corporate trustees or by individual trustees.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a governing instrument provides that a fund will revert to the donor if, and only if, the institution ceases to exist or the purposes of the fund fail, then the fund will be considered an institutional fund until such contingency occurs.

        Subsection (7). Program-Related Asset.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (7). Program-Related Asset. Although UPMIFA does not apply to program-related assets, if program-related assets serve, in part, as investments for an institution, then the institution should identify categories for reporting those investments and should establish investment criteria for the investments that are reasonably related to achieving the institution’s charitable purposes. For example, a program providing below-market loans to inner-city businesses may be “primarily to accomplish a charitable purpose of the institution” but also can be considered, in part, an investment. The institution should create reasonable credit standards and other guidelines for the program to increase the likelihood that the loans will be repaid.

        Purpose and Scope of Revisions. This section adopts the prudence standard for investment decision making. The section directs directors or others responsible for managing and investing the funds of an institution to act as a prudent investor would, using a portfolio approach in making investments and considering the risk and return objectives of the fund. The section lists the factors that commonly bear on decisions in fiduciary investing and incorporates the duty to diversify investments absent a conclusion that special circumstances make a decision not to diversify reasonable. Thus, the section follows modern portfolio theory for investment decision making. Section 3 [this section] applies to all funds held by an institution, regardless of whether the institution obtained the funds by gift or otherwise and regardless of whether the funds are restricted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Drafting Committee discussed extensively the standard that should govern nonprofit managers. UMIFA states the standard as “ordinary business care and prudence under the facts and circumstances prevailing at the time of the action or decision.” Since the decision in
    Stern v. Lucy Webb Hayes National Training School for Deaconesses
    , 381 F. Supp. 1003 (1974), the trend has been to hold directors of nonprofit corporations to a standard nominally similar to the corporate standard but with the recognition that the facts and circumstances considered include the fact that the entity is a charity and not a business corporation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of the prudence standard adopted in UPMIFA is derived from the RMNCA and from the prudent investor rule of UPIA. The standard is consistent with the business judgment standard under corporate law,
    as applied to charitable institutions.
    That is, a manager operating a charitable organization under the business judgment rule would look to the same factors as those identified by the prudent investor rule. The standard for prudent investment set forth in Section 3 [this section] first states the duty of care as articulated in the RMNCA, but provides more specific guidance for those managing and investing institutional funds by incorporating language from UPIA. The criteria derived from UPIA are consistent with good practice under current law applicable to nonprofit corporations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trust law norms already inform managers of nonprofit corporations. The Preamble to UPIA explains: “Although the Uniform Prudent Investor Act by its terms applies to trusts and not to charitable corporations, the standards of the Act can be expected to inform the investment responsibilities of directors and officers of charitable corporations.”
    See also
    , Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 379, Comment b, at 190 (1992) (stating that “absent a contrary statute or other provision, the prudent investor rule applies to investment of funds held for charitable corporations.”). Trust precedents have routinely been found to be helpful but not binding authority in corporate cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Drafting Committee decided that by adopting language from both the RMNCA and UPIA, UPMIFA could clarify that common standards of prudent investing apply to all charitable institutions. Although the principal trust authorities, UPIA § (2)(a), Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 337, UTC § 804, and Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 174 (prudent administration) use the phrase “care, skill and caution,” the Drafting Committee decided to use the more familiar corporate formulation as found in RMNCA. The standard also appears in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of UPMIFA. The Drafting Committee does not intend any substantive change to the UPIA standard and believes that “reasonable care, skill, and caution” are implicit in the term “care” as used in the RMNCA. The Drafting Committee included the detailed provisions from UPIA, because the Committee believed that the greater precision of the prudence norms of the Restatement and UPIA, as compared with UMIFA, could helpfully inform managers of charitable institutions. For an explanation of the Prudent Investor Act, see John H. Langbein,
    The Uniform Prudent Investor Act and the Future of Trust Investing
    , 81 Iowa L. Rev. 641 (1996), and for a discussion of the effect UPIA has had on investment decision making, see Max M. Schanzenbach & Robert H. Sitkoff,
        Did Reform of Prudent Trust Investment Laws Change Trust Portfolio Allocation?,
        50 J. L. & Econ. (forthcoming 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3 [this section] has incorporated the provisions of UPIA with only a few exceptions. UPIA applies to private trusts and is entirely default law. The settlor of a private trust has complete control over virtually all trust provisions. See UTC § 105. Because UPMIFA applies to charitable organizations, UPMIFA makes the duty of care, the duty to minimize costs, and the duty to investigate mandatory. The duty of loyalty is mandatory under applicable organization law, corporate or trust. Other than these duties, the provisions of Section 3 [this section] are default rules. A gift instrument or the governing instruments of an institution can modify these duties, but the charitable purpose doctrine limits the extent to which an institution or a donor can restrict these duties. In addition, subsection (a) [(1)] of Section 3 [this section] reminds the decision maker that the intent of a donor expressed in a gift instrument will control decision making. Further, the decision maker must consider the charitable purposes of the institution and the purposes of the institutional fund for which decisions are being made. These factors are specific to charitable organizations; UPIA § 2(a) states the duty to consider similar factors in the private trust context.
       </p>
       <p>
        UPMIFA does not include the duty of impartiality, stated in UPIA § 6, because nonprofit corporations do not confront the multiple beneficiaries problem to which the duty is addressed. Under UPIA, a trustee must treat the current beneficiaries and the remainder beneficiaries with due regard to their respective interests, subject to alternative direction from the trust document. A nonprofit corporation typically creates one charity. The institution may serve multiple beneficiaries, but those beneficiaries do not have enforceable rights in the institution in the same way that beneficiaries of a private trust do. Of course, if a charitable trust is created to benefit more than one charity, rather than being created to carry out a charitable purpose, then UPIA will apply the duty of impartiality to that trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other respects, the Drafting Committee made changes to language from UPIA only where necessary to adapt the language for charitable institutions. No material differences are intended. Subsection (e)(1)(D) [(5)(a)(iv)] of Section 3 of UPMIFA does not include a clause that appears at the end of UPIA § 2(c)(4) (“which may include financial assets, interest in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, and real property.”). The Drafting Committee deemed this clause unnecessary for charitable institutions. The language of subsection (e)(1)(G) [(5)(a)(vii)] reflects a modification of the language of UPIA § (2)(c)(7). Other minor modifications to the UPIA provisions make the language more appropriate for charitable institutions.
    The duties imposed by this section apply to those who govern an institution, including directors and trustees, and to those to whom the directors or managers delegate responsibility for investment and management of institutional funds. The standard applies to officers and employees of an institution and to agents who invest and manage institutional funds. Volunteers who work with an institution will be subject to the duties imposed here, but state and federal statutes may provide reduced liability for persons who act without compensation. UPMIFA does not affect the application of those shield statutes.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) [(1)]. Donor Intent and Charitable Purposes. Subsection (a) [(1)] states the overarching duty to comply with donor intent as expressed in the terms of the gift instrument. The emphasis in the Act on giving effect to donor intent does not mean that the donor can or should control the management of the institution. The other fundamental duty is the duty to consider the charitable purposes of the institution and of the institutional fund in making management and investment decisions. UPIA § 2(a) states a similar duty to consider the purposes of a trust in investing and managing assets of a trust.

        Subsection (b) [(2)]. Duty of Loyalty.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) [(2)]. Duty of Loyalty. Subsection (b) [(2)] reminds those managing and investing institutional funds that the duty of loyalty will apply to their actions, but Section 3 [this section] does not state the loyalty standard that applies. The Drafting Committee was concerned, at least nominally, that different standards of loyalty may apply to directors of nonprofit corporations and to trustees of charitable trusts. The RMNCA provides that under the duty of loyalty a director of a nonprofit corporation should act “in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.” RMNCA § 8.30. The trust law articulation of the loyalty standard uses “sole interests” rather than “best interests.” As the Restatement of Trusts explains, “[t]he trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiary.” Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 170 (1). Although the standards for loyalty, like the standard of care, are merging, see Evelyn Brody, Charitable Governance: What’s Trust Law Got to do With It? Chi.-Kent L. Rev. (2005); John H. Langbein, Questioning the Trust Law Duty of Loyalty: Sole Interest or Best Interest, 114 Yale L.J. 929 (2005), the Drafting Committee concluded that formulating a duty of loyalty provision for UPMIFA was unnecessary. Thus the duty of loyalty under nonprofit corporation law will apply to charities organized as nonprofit corporations, and the duty of loyalty under trust law will apply to charitable trusts.

        Subsection (b) [(2)]. Duty of Care.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) [(2)]. Duty of Care. Subsection (b) [(2)] also applies the duty of care to performance of investment duties. The language derives from § 8.30 of the RMNCA. This subsection states the duty to act in good faith, “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances.” Although the language in the RMNCA and in UPMIFA is similar to that of § 8.30 of the Model Business Corporation Act (3d ed. 2002), the standard as applied to persons making decisions for charities is informed by the fact that the institution is a charity and not a business corporation. Thus, in UPMIFA the references to “like position” and “similar circumstances” mean that the charitable nature of the institution affects the decision making of a prudent person acting under the standard set forth in subsection (b) [(2)]. The duty of care involves considering the factors set forth in subsection (e)(1) [(5)(a)]. Subsection (c)(1) [(3)(a)]. Duty to Minimize Costs. Subsection (c)(1) [(3)(a)] tracks the language of UPIA § 7 and requires an institution to minimize costs. An institution may prudently incur costs by hiring an investment advisor, but the costs incurred should be appropriate under the circumstances. See UPIA § 7 cmt; Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 227, cmt. M, at 58 (1992); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 188 (1959). The duty is consistent with the duty to act prudently under § 8.30 of the RMNCA.

       <p>
        Subsection (d) [(4)]. Pooling Funds. An institution holding more than one institutional fund may find that pooling its funds for investment and management purposes will be economically beneficial. The Act permits pooling for these purposes. The prohibition against commingling no longer prevents pooling funds for investment and management purposes. See UPIA § 3, cmt. (duty to diversify aided by pooling); UPIA § 7, cmt. (pooling to minimize costs); Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Duty to Segregate and Identify Trust Property § 84 (T.D. No. 4 2005). Funds will be considered individually for other purposes of the Act, including for the spending rule for endowment funds of Section 4 and the modification rules of Section 6.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (e)(1) [(5)(a)]. Prudent Decision Making. Subsection (e)(1) [(5)(a)] takes much of its language from UPIA § 2(c). In making decisions about whether to acquire or retain an asset, the institution should consider the institution’s mission, its current programs, and the desire to cultivate additional donations from a donor, in addition to factors related more directly to the asset’s potential as an investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (e)(1)(C) [(5)(a)(iii)] reflects the fact that some organizations will invest in taxable investments that may generate unrelated business taxable income for income tax purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Assets held primarily for program-related purposes are not subject to UPMIFA. The management of those assets will continue to be governed by other laws applicable to the institution. Other assets may not be held primarily for program-related purposes but may have both investment purposes and program-related purposes. Subsections (a) and (e)(1)(H) [(1) and (5)(a)(viii)] indicate that a prudent decision maker can take into consideration the relationship between an investment and the purposes of the institution and of the institutional fund in making an investment that may have a program-related purpose but not be primarily program-related. The degree to which an institution uses an asset to accomplish a charitable purpose will affect the weight given that factor in a decision to acquire or retain the asset.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (e)(3) [(5)(c)]. Broad Investment Authority. Consistent with the portfolio theory of investment, this subsection permits a broad range of investments. The language derives from UPIA § 2(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 4 of UMIFA indicated that an institution could invest “without restriction to investments a fiduciary may make.” The committee removed this language from subsection (e)(3) [(5)(c)] as unnecessary, because states no longer have legal lists restricting fiduciary investing to the specific types of investments identified in statutory lists.
    Subsection (e)(3) [(5)(c)] also provides that other law may limit the authority under this subsection. In addition, all of subsection (e) [(5)] is subject to contrary provisions in a gift instrument, and a gift instrument may restrict the ability to invest in particular assets. For example, the gift instrument for a particular institutional fund might preclude the institution from investing the assets of the fund in companies that produce tobacco products.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (e)(4) [(5)(d)]. Duty to Diversify. This subsection assumes that prudence requires diversification but permits an institution to determine that nondiversification is appropriate under exceptional circumstances. A decision not to diversify must be based on the needs of the charity and not solely for the benefit of a donor. A decision to retain property in the hope of obtaining additional contributions from the same donor may be considered made for the benefit of the charity, but the appropriateness of that decision will depend on the circumstances. This subsection derives its language from UPIA § 3. See UPIA § 3 cmt. (discussing the rationale for diversification); Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 227 (1992).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (e)(5) [(5)(e)]. Disposing of Unsuitable Assets. This subsection imposes a duty on an institution to review the suitability of retaining property contributed to the institution within a reasonable period of time after the institution receives the property. Subsection (e)(5) [(5)(e)] requires the institution to make a decision but does not require a particular outcome. The institution may consider a variety of factors in making its decision, and a decision to retain the property either for a period of time or indefinitely may be a prudent decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 4(2) of UMIFA specifically authorized an institution to retain property contributed by a donor. The comment explained that an institution might retain property in the hope of obtaining additional contributions from the donor. Under UPMIFA the potential for developing additional contributions by retaining property contributed to the institution would be among the “other circumstances” that the institution might consider in deciding whether to retain or dispose of the property. The institution must weigh the potential for obtaining additional contributions with all other factors that affect the suitability of retaining the property in the investment portfolio.

       <p>
        Subsection (e)(6) [(5)(f)]. Special Skills or Expertise. Subsection (e)(6) [(5)(f)] states the rule provided in UPIA § 2(f) requiring a trustee to use the trustee’s own skills and expertise in carrying out the trustee’s fiduciary duties. The comment to RMNCA § 8.30 describes the existence of a similar rule under the law of nonprofit corporations. Section 8.30(a)(2) provides that in discharging duties a director must act “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. . . .” The comment explains that“[t]he concept of ‘under similar circumstances’ relates not only to the circumstances of the corporation but to the special background, qualifications, and management experience of the individual director and the role the director plays in the corporation.” After describing directors chosen for their ability to raise money, the comment notes that “[n]o special skill or expertise should be expected from such directors unless their background or knowledge evidences some special ability.” The intent of subsection (e)(6) [(5)(f)] is that a person managing or investing institutional funds must use the person’s own judgment and experience, including any particular skills or expertise, in carrying out the management or investment duties. For example, if a charity names a person as a director in part because the person is a lawyer, the lawyer’s background may allow the lawyer to recognize legal issues in connection with funds held by the charity. The lawyer should identify the issues for the board, but the lawyer is not expected to provide legal advice. A lawyer is not expected to be able to recognize every legal issue, particularly issues outside the lawyer’s area of expertise, simply because the board member is lawyer.

        UMIFA contained two provisions that authorized investments in pooled or common investment funds. UMIFA §§ 4(3), 4(4). The Drafting Committee concluded that Section 3(e)(3) [(5)(c)] of UPMIFA authorizes these investments. The decision not to include the two provisions in UPMIFA implies no disapproval of such investments.

        Purpose and Scope of Revisions.

       <p>
        Purpose and Scope of Revisions. This section revises the provision in UMIFA that permitted the expenditure of appreciation of an endowment fund to the extent the fund had appreciated in value above the fund’s historic dollar value. UMIFA defined historic dollar value to mean all contributions to the fund, valued at the time of contribution. Instead of using historic dollar value as a limitation, UPMIFA applies a more carefully articulated prudence standard to the process of making decisions about expenditures from an endowment fund. The expenditure rule of Section 4 [this section] applies only to the extent that a donor and an institution have not reached some other agreement about spending from an endowment. If a gift instrument sets forth specific requirements for spending, then the charity must comply with those requirements. However, if the gift instrument uses more general language, for example directing the charity to “hold the fund as an endowment” or “retain principal and spend income,” then Section 4 [this section] provides a rule of construction to guide the charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the promulgation of UMIFA, “income” for trust accounting purposes meant interest and dividends but not capital gains, whether or not realized. Many institutions assumed that trust accounting principles applied to charities organized as nonprofit corporations, and the rules limited the institutions’ ability to invest their endowment funds effectively. UMIFA addressed this problem by construing “income” in gift instruments to include a prudent amount of capital gains, both realized and unrealized. Under UMIFA an institution could spend appreciation in addition to spending income determined under trust accounting rules. This rule of construction likely carried out the intent of the donor better than a rule limiting spending to trust accounting income, while permitting the charity to invest in a manner that could generate better returns for the fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        UPMIFA also applies a rule of construction to terms like “income” or “endowment.” The assumption in the Act is that a donor who uses one of these terms intends to create a fund that will generate sufficient gains to be able to make ongoing distributions from the fund while at the same time preserving the purchasing power of the fund. Because historic dollar value under UMIFA was a number fixed in time, the use of that approach may not have adequately captured the intent of a donor who wanted the endowment fund to continue to maintain its value in current dollars. UPMIFA takes a different approach, directing the institution to determine spending based on the total assets of the endowment fund rather than determining spending by adding a prudent amount of appreciation to trust accounting income.

        Subsection (a) [(1)]. Expenditure of Endowment Funds.
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p class="">
    UPMIFA requires the persons making spending decisions for an endowment fund to focus on the purposes of the endowment fund as opposed to the purposes of the institution more generally, as was the case under UMIFA. When the institution considers the purposes and duration of the fund, the institution will give priority to the donor’s general intent that the fund be maintained permanently. Although the Act does not require that a specific amount be set aside as “principal,” the Act assumes that the charity will act to preserve “principal” (i.e., to maintain the purchasing power of the amounts contributed to the fund) while spending “income” (i.e. making a distribution each year that represents a reasonable spending rate, given investment performance and general economic conditions). Thus, an institution should monitor principal in an accounting sense, identifying the original value of the fund (the historic dollar value) and the increases in value necessary to maintain the purchasing power of the fund. Subsection (a) [(1)]. Expenditure of Endowment Funds. Subsection (a) [(1)] uses the RMNCA articulation of the standard of care for decision making under Section 4 [this section]. The change in language does not reflect a substantive change. The comment to Section 3 [§ 33-5003] more fully describes that standard of care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 4 [this section] permits expenditures from an endowment fund to the extent the institution determines that the expenditures are prudent after considering the factors listed in subsection (a). These factors emphasize the importance of the intent of the donor, as expressed in a gift instrument. Section 4 [this section] looks to written documents as evidence of donor’s intent and does not require an institution to rely on oral expressions of intent. By requiring written evidence of intent, the Act protects reliance by the donor and the institution on the written terms of a donative agreement. Informal conversations may be misremembered and may be subject to multiple interpretations. Of course, oral expressions of intent may guide an institution in further carrying out a donor’s wishes and in understanding a donor’s intent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The factors in subsection (a) [(1)] require attention to the purposes of the institution and the endowment fund, economic conditions, and present and reasonably anticipated resources of the institution. As under UMIFA, determinations under Section 4 [this section] do not depend on the characterization of assets as income or principal and are not limited to the amount of income and unrealized appreciation. The authority in Section 4 [this section] is permissive, however, and an institution organized as a trust may continue to make spending decisions under trust accounting principles so long as doing so is prudent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Institutions have operated effectively under UMIFA and have operated more conservatively than the historic dollar value rule would have permitted. Institutions have little incentive to maximize allowable spending. Good practice has been to provide for modest expenditures while maintaining the purchasing power of a fund. Institutions have followed this practice even though UMIFA (1) does not require an institution to maintain a fund’s purchasing power and (2) does allow an institution to spend any amounts in a fund above historic dollar value, subject to the prudence standard. The Drafting Committee concluded that eliminating historic dollar value and providing institutions with more discretion would not lead to depletion of endowment funds. Instead, UPMIFA should encourage institutions to establish a spending policy that will be responsive to short-term fluctuations in the value of the fund. Section 4 [this section] allows an institution to maintain appropriate levels of expenditures in times of economic downturn or economic strength. In some years, accumulation rather than spending will be prudent, and in other years an institution may appropriately make expenditures even if a fund has not generated investment return that year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several levels of safeguard exist to prevent an institution from depleting an endowment fund or diverting assets from the purposes for which the fund was created. In comparison with UMIFA, UPMIFA provides greater direction to the institution with respect to making a prudent determination about spending from an endowment. UMIFA told the decision maker to consider “long and short term needs of the institution in carrying out its educational, religious, charitable, or other eleemosynary purposes, its present and anticipated financial requirements, expected total return on its investments, price level trends, and general economic conditions.” UPMIFA clarifies that in making spending decisions the institution should attempt to ensure that the value of the fund endures while still providing that some amounts be spent for the purposes of the endowment fund. In UPMIFA prudent decision making emphasizes the endowment aspect of the fund, rather than the overall purposes or needs of the institution.
    In addition to the guidance provided by Section 4 [this section], other safeguards exist. Donors can restrict gifts and can provide specific instructions to donee institutions regarding appropriate uses for assets contributed. Within institutions, fiduciary duties govern the persons making decisions on expenditures. Those persons must operate both with the best interests of the institution in mind and in keeping with the intent of donors. If an institution diverts an institutional fund from the charitable purposes of the institution, the state attorney general can enforce the charitable interests of the public. By relying on these safeguards while providing institutions with adequate discretion to make appropriate expenditures, the Act creates a standard that takes into consideration the diversity of the charitable sector. The committee expects that accumulated experience with such spending formulas will continue to inform institutional practice under the Act.

        Distinguishing Legal and Accounting Standards.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Distinguishing Legal and Accounting Standards. Deleting historic dollar value does not transform any portion of an endowment fund into unrestricted assets from a legal standpoint. An endowment fund is restricted because of the donor’s intent that the fund be restricted by the prudent spending rule, that the fund not be spent in the current year, and that the fund continue to maintain its value for a long time. Regardless of the treatment of endowment fund from an accounting standpoint, legally an endowment fund should not be considered unrestricted. Subsection (a) states that endowment funds will be legally restricted until the institution appropriates funds for expenditure. The UMIFA statutes in Utah and Maine contain similar language. 13 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 13 § 4106 (West 2005); Utah Code Ann. 1953 § 13-29-3 (2005). See, also, advisory published by Mass. Attorney General, “The Attorney General’s Position on FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 117, ¶ 22 and Related G.L.C. 180A Issues” (January 2004) http://www.ago.state.ma.us/filelibrary/fasb.pdf (last visited May 22, 2006) (concerning the treatment of endowments as legally restricted assets).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “endowment fund” includes funds that may last in perpetuity but also funds that are created to last for a fixed term of years or until the institution achieves a specified objective. Section 4 [this section] requires the institution to consider the intended duration of the fund in making determinations about spending. For example, if a donor directs that a fund be spent over 20 years, Section 4 [this section] will guide the institution in making distribution decisions. The institution would amortize the fund over 20 years rather than try to maintain the fund in perpetuity. For an endowment fund of limited duration, spending at a rate higher than rates typically used for endowment spending will be both necessary and prudent.

        Subsection (c) [(3)]. Rule of Construction.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) [(3)]. Rule of Construction. Donor’s intent must be respected in the process of making decisions to expend endowment funds. Section 4 [this section] does not allow an institution to convert an endowment fund into a non-endowment fund nor does the section allow the institution to ignore a donor’s intent that a fund be maintained as an endowment. Rather, subsection (c) [(3)] provides rules of construction to assist institutions in interpreting donor’s intent. Subsection (c) [(3)] assumes that if a donor wants an institution to spend “only the income” from a fund, the donor intends that the fund both support current expenditures and be preserved permanently. The donor is unlikely to be concerned about designation of particular returns as “income” or “principal” under accounting principles. Rather the donor is more likely to assume that the institution will use modern total-return investing techniques to generate enough funds to distribute while maintaining the long-term viability of the fund. Subsection (c) [(3)] is an intent effectuating provision that provides default rules to construe donor’s intent. As subsection (b) [(2)] explains, a donor who wants to specify particular spending guidelines can do so. For example, a donor might require that a charity spend between three and five percent of an endowed gift each year, regardless of investment performance or other factors. Because the charity agrees to the restriction in accepting the gift, the restriction will govern spending decisions by the charity. Another donor might want to limit expenditures to trust accounting income and not want the institution to be able to expend appreciation. An instruction to “pay only the income” will not be specific enough, but an instruction to “pay only interest and dividend income earned by the fund and not to make other distributions of the kind authorized by Section 4 of UPMIFA” should be sufficient. If a donor indicates that the rules on investing or expenditures under Section 4 [this section] do not apply to a particular fund, then as a practical matter the institution will probably invest the fund separately. Thus, a decision by a donor to require fund specific expenditure rules will likely also have consequences in the way the institution invests the fund.

        Retroactive Application of the Rule of Construction.
       </h5>
       <p>
        If a donor has stated in a gift instrument specific directions as to spending, then the institution must respect those wishes, but many donors do not give precise instructions about how to spend endowment funds. In Section 4 [this section] UPMIFA provides guidance for giving effect to a donor’s intent when the donor has not been specific. Like Section 3 of UMIFA, Section 4 [this section] of UPMIFA is a rule of construction, so it does not violate either donor intent or the Constitution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of whether to apply a rule of construction retroactively was considered in connection with UMIFA. When the New Hampshire legislature considered UMIFA, the Senate asked the New Hampshire Supreme Court for an opinion regarding whether UMIFA, if adopted, would violate a provision of the state constitution prohibiting retrospective laws, and also whether the statute would encroach on the functions of the judicial branch. The opinion answered no to both questions. Opinion of the Justices, Request of the Senate No. 6667, 113 N.H. 287, 306 A.2d 55 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        More recently the Colorado Supreme Court considered the retroactive application of another constructional statute, one that deems the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy to be revoked in a case in which the marriage was dissolved after the naming of the spouse as beneficiary. In re Estate of DeWitt, 54 P. 3d 849 (Colo. 2002). In holding that retroactive application of the statute did not violate the Contracts Clause, the court cited approvingly from a statement prepared by the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trusts and Estates Acts (JEB). JEB Statement Regarding the Constitutionality of Changes in Default Rules as Applied to PreExisting Documents, 17 Am. Coll. Tr. & Est. Couns. Notes 184 app. II (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The JEB Statement explains that the purpose of the anti-retroactivity norm is to protect a transferor who relies on existing rules of law. By definition, however, rules of construction apply only in situations in which a transferor did not spell out his or her intent and hence did not rely on the then-current rule of construction.
    See also In re Gardner’s Trust
    , 266 Minn. 127, 132, 123 N.W. 2d 69, 73 (1963) (“[I]t is doubtful whether the testatrix had any clear intention in mind at the time the will was executed. It is equally plausible that if she had thought about it at all she would have desired to have the dividends go where the law required them to go at the time they were received by the trustee.”) (Uniform Principal and Income Act).
    Non-retroactivity would produce serious practical problems: If the Act were not retroactive, a charity would need to keep two sets of books for each endowment fund created before the enactment of UPMIFA, if new funds were added after the enactment. The burden that such a rule would impose is out of proportion to the benefit sought.

        Subsection (d). Rebuttable Presumption of Imprudence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (d). Rebuttable Presumption of Imprudence. The Drafting Committee debated at length whether to include a presumption of imprudence for spending above a fixed percentage of the value of the fund. The Drafting Committee decided to include a presumption in the Act in brackets, as an option for states to consider, and to include in these Comments a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of including a presumption in the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some who commented on the Act viewed the presumption as linked to the retroactive application of the rule of construction of subsection (c) [(3)]. A donor who contributed to an endowment fund under UMIFA may have assumed that the historic dollar value of the gift would be subject to a no-spending rule under the statute. Because UPMIFA removes the concept of historic dollar value, the bracketed presumption of imprudence would assure the donor that spending from an endowment fund will be so limited.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those in favor of the presumption of imprudence argued that the presumption would curb the temptation that a charity might have to spend endowment assets too rapidly. Although the presumption would be rebuttable, and spending above the identified percentage might, in some years and for some charities, be prudent, institutions would likely be reluctant to authorize spending above seven percent. In addition, the presumption would give the attorney general a benchmark of sorts.
       </p>
       <p>
        A variety of considerations cut against including a presumption of imprudence in the statute. A fixed percentage in the statute might be perceived as a safe harbor that could lead institutions to spend more than is prudent. Although the provision should not be read to imply that spending below seven percent will be considered prudent, some charities might interpret the statute in that way. Decision makers might be pressured to spend up to the percentage, and in doing so spend more than is prudent, without adequate review of the prudence factors as required under the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the biggest problem with including a presumption in the statute is the difficulty of picking a number that will be appropriate in view of the range of institutions and charitable purposes and the fact that economic conditions will change over time. Under recent economic conditions, a spending rate of seven percent is too high for most funds, but in a period of high inflation, seven percent might be too low. In making a prudent decision regarding how much to spend from an endowment fund, each institution must consider a variety of factors, including the particular purposes of the fund, the wishes of the donors, changing economic factors, and whether the fund will receive future donations.

        Application of Presumption.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Whether or not a statute includes the presumption, institutions must remember that prudence controls decision making. Each institution must make decisions on expenditures based on the circumstances of the particular charity. Application of Presumption. For a state wishing to adopt a presumption of imprudence, subsection (d) provides language. Under subsection (d), a rebuttable presumption of imprudence will arise if expenditures in one year exceed seven percent of the assets of an endowment fund. The subsection applies a rolling average of three or more years in determining the value of the fund for purposes of calculating the seven-percent amount. An institution can rebut the presumption of imprudence if circumstances in a particular year make expenditures above that amount prudent. The concept and the language for the presumption of imprudence comes from Mass. Gen. L. ch. 180A, § 2 (2004). Massachusetts enacted this rule in 1975 as part of its UMIFA statute. New Mexico adopted the same presumption in 1978. N.M.S.A. § 46-9-2C (2004). New Hampshire has a similar provision. N.H. Rev. Stat. § 292-B:6.
       </p>
       <p>
        The period that a charity uses to calculate the presumption (three or more years) and the frequency of valuation (at least quarterly) will be binding in any determination of whether the presumption applies. For example, if a charity values an endowment fund on a quarterly basis and averages the quarterly values over three years to determine the fair market value of the fund for purposes calculating seven percent of the fund, the charity’s choices of three years as a smoothing period and quarterly as a valuation period cannot be challenged. If the charity makes an appropriation that is less than seven percent of this value, then the presumption of imprudence does not arise even if the appropriation would exceed seven percent of the value of the fund calculated based on monthly valuations averaged over five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        If sufficient evidence establishes, by the preponderance of the evidence, the facts necessary to raise the presumption of imprudence, then the institution will have to carry the burden of production of (i.e., the burden of going forward with) other evidence that would tend to demonstrate that its decision was prudent. The existence of the presumption does not shift the burden of persuasion to the charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expenditures from an endowment fund may include distributions for charitable purposes and amounts used for the management and administration of the fund, including annual charges for fundraising. The value of a fund, as calculated for purposes of determining the seven percent amount, will reflect increases due to contributions and investment gains and decreases due to distributions and investment losses. The seven percent figure includes charges for fundraising and administrative expenses other than investment management expenses. All costs or fees associated with an endowment fund are factors that prudent decision makers consider. High costs or fees of investment management could be considered imprudent regardless of whether spending exceeds seven percent of the fund’s value.
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption of imprudence does not create an automatic safe harbor. Expenditures at six percent might well be imprudently high.

A presumption of imprudence can serve as a reminder that spending at too high a rate will jeopardize the long-term nature of an endowment fund. If an endowment fund is intended to continue permanently, the institution should take special care to limit annual spending to a level that protects the purchasing power of the fund.
    Subsection (d) provides that the terms of the gift instrument can provide additional spending authority. For example, if a gift instrument directs that an institution expend a fund over a ten-year period, exhausting the fund after ten years, spending at a rate higher than seven percent will be necessary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (d) does not require an institution to spend a minimum amount each year. The prudence standard and the needs of the institution will supply sufficient guidance regarding whether to accumulate rather than to spend in a particular year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spending above seven percent in any one year will not necessarily be imprudent. For some endowment funds fluctuating spending rates may be appropriate. Although the Act does not apply the percentage for the presumption on a rolling basis (e.g., 21 percent over three years), some endowment funds may prudently spend little or nothing in some years and more than seven percent in other years. For example, a charity planning a construction project might decide to spend nothing from an endowment for three years and then in the fourth year might spend 20 percent of the value of the fund for construction costs. The decision to accumulate in years one through three and then to spend 20 percent in the fourth year might be prudent for the charity, depending on the other factors. The charity should maintain adequate records during the accumulation period and should document the decision-making process in the fourth year to be able to meet the burden of production associated with the presumption. Another charity might prudently spend 20 percent in year one and nothing for the following three years. That charity would also need to document the decision-making process through which the decision to spend occurred and maintain records explaining why the decision was prudent under the circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        A charity might establish a “capital replacement fund” designed to provide funds to the institution for repair or replacement of major items of equipment. Disbursements from such a fund will likely fluctuate, with limited expenditures in some years and big expenditures in others. The fund would not exhibit a uniform spending rate. Indeed, an advantage of a capital replacement fund is the ability to absorb a significant capital expenditure in a single year without a negative impact on the operating budget of the institution. Disbursements might average five percent per year but would vary, with spending in some years more and in some years less. Even if this fund is an endowment fund subject to Section 4 [this section], spending above seven percent in a particular year could well be prudent. Subsection (d) does not preclude spending above seven percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        A charity creating a capital replacement fund or a building fund might chose to adopt spending rules for the fund that would not be subject to UPMIFA. Specific donor intent can supersede the rules of UPMIFA. If the charity creates a gift instrument that establishes appropriate rules on spending for the fund, and if donors agree to those restrictions, then the UPMIFA rules on spending, including the bracketed presumption, will not apply.

        Institutions with Limited Investment and Spending Experience.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Institutions with Limited Investment and Spending Experience. Several attorneys general and other charity officials raised concerns about whether small institutions would be able to adjust to a spending rule based solely on prudence, without the bright-line guidance of historic dollar value. Some charity regulators who spoke with the Drafting Committee noted that large institutions have sophisticated investment strategies, access to good investment advisors, and experience with spending rules that maintain purchasing power for endowment funds. For these institutions, the rules of UPMIFA should work well. For smaller institutions, however, the state regulators thought that additional guidance could be helpful. After discussing strategies to address this concern, the Drafting Committee decided to include in these comments an additional optional provision that a state could choose to include in its UPMIFA statute. The optional provision focuses on institutions with endowment funds valued, in the aggregate, at less than $2,000,000. The number is in brackets to indicate that it could be set higher or lower. The number was chosen to address the concern of the state regulators that some small charities might be more likely to spend imprudently than large charities. The Drafting Committee selected $2,000,000 as the value that might include most unsophisticated institutions but would not be overinclusive.
       </p>
       <p>
        The optional provision creates a notification requirement for an institution with a small endowment that plans to spend below historic dollar value. If an institution subject to the provision decides to appropriate an amount that would cause the value of its endowment funds to drop below the aggregate historic dollar value for all of its endowment funds, then the institution will have to notify the attorney general before proceeding with the expenditure. The provision does not require that the institution obtain the approval of the attorney general before making the distribution. Rather, the notification requirement gives the attorney general the opportunity to take a closer look at the institution and its spending decision, to educate the institution on prudent decision making for endowment funds, and to intervene if the attorney general determines that the spending would be imprudent for the institution. Although the Drafting Committee thinks that the prudence standard in UPMIFA provides adequate guidance to all institutions within the scope of the Act, if a state chooses to adopt a notification provision for institutions with small endowments, the Drafting Committee recommends the following language:
       </p>
       <p>
        (—) If an institution has endowment funds with an aggregate value of less than [$2,000,000], the institution shall notify the [Attorney General] at least [60 days] prior to an appropriation for expenditure of an amount that would cause the value of the institution’s endowment funds to fall below the aggregate historic dollar value of the institution’s endowment funds, unless the expenditure is permitted or required under law other than this [act] or in the gift instrument. For purposes of this subsection, “historic dollar value” means the aggregate value in dollars of (i) each endowment fund at the time it became an endowment fund, (ii) each subsequent donation to the fund at the time the donation is made, and (iii) each accumulation made pursuant to a direction in the applicable gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The institution’s determination of historic dollar value made in good faith is conclusive.

       OFFICIAL COMMENT
      </h4>
      <p>
       The prudent investor standard in Section 4 [§ 33-5004] presupposes the power to delegate. For some types of investment, prudence requires diversification, and diversification may best be accomplished through the use of pooled investment vehicles that entail delegation. The Drafting Committee decided to put Section 5 [this section] in brackets because many states already provide sufficient authority to delegate authority through other statutes. If such authority exists, then an enacting state should enact UPMIFA without Section 5 [this section]. Enacting delegation rules that duplicate existing rules could be confusing and might create conflicts. For charitable trusts, UPIA provides the same delegation rules as those in Section 5 [this section]. For nonprofit corporations, nonprofit corporation statutes often provide comparable rules. A state enacting UPMIFA must be certain that its laws authorize delegation, either through other statutes or by enacting Section 5 [this section].
    Section 5 [this section] incorporates the delegation rule found in UPIA § 9, updating the delegation rules in UMIFA § 5. Section 5 [this section] permits the decision makers in an institution to delegate management and investment functions to external agents if the decision makers exercise reasonable skill, care, and caution in selecting the agent, defining the scope of the delegation and reviewing the performance of the agent. In some circumstances, the scope of the delegation may include redelegation. For example, an institution may select an investment manager to assist with investment decisions. The delegation may include the authority to redelegate to investment managers with expertise in particular investment areas. All decisions to delegate require the exercise of reasonable care, skill, and caution in selecting, instructing, and monitoring agents. Further, decision makers cannot delegate the authority to make decisions concerning expenditures and can only delegate management and investment functions. Subsection (c) [(3)] protects decision makers who comply with the requirement for proper delegation from liability for actions or decisions of the agents. In making decisions concerning delegation, the institution must be mindful of Section 3(c)(1) [§ 33-5003(3)(a)] of UPMIFA, the provision that directs the institution to incur only reasonable costs in managing and investing an institutional fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 5 [this section] does not address issues of internal delegation and potential liability for internal delegation, and subsection (c) [(3)] does not affect laws that govern personal liability of directors or trustees for matters outside the scope of Section 5 [this section]. Directors will look to nonprofit corporation laws for these rules, while trustees will look to trust law.
    See, e.g.
    , RMNCA, § 8.30(b) (permitting directors to rely on information prepared by an officer or employee of the institution if the director reasonably believes the officer or employee to be reliable and competent in the matters presented).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of subsection (c) [(3)] is similar to that of UPIA § 9(c) and RMNCA § 8.30(d). The decision not to include the terms “beneficiaries” or “members” in subsection (c) [(3)] does not indicate a decision that this section does not create immunity from claims brought by beneficiaries or members. Instead, a decision maker who complies with Section 5 [this section] will be protected from any liability resulting from actions or decisions made by an external agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) [(4)] creates personal jurisdiction over the agent. This subsection is not a choice of law rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) [(5)] notes that law other than this Act governs internal delegation. Section 5 of UMIFA included internal delegation as well as external delegation, due to a concern at that time that trust law concepts might govern internal delegation in nonprofit corporations. With the widespread adoption of nonprofit corporation statutes, that concern no longer exists. The decision not to address internal delegation in UPMIFA does not suggest that a governing board of a nonprofit corporation cannot delegate to committees, officers, or employees. Rather, a nonprofit corporation must look to other law, typically a nonprofit corporation statute, for the rules governing internal delegation.

       <p>
        Section 6 [this section] expands the rules on releasing or modifying restrictions that are found in Section 7 of UMIFA. Subsection (a) [(1)] restates the rule from UMIFA allowing the release of a restriction with donor consent. Subsections (b) and (c) [(2) and (3)] make clear that an institution can always ask a court to apply equitable deviation or
    cy pres
    to modify or release a restriction, under appropriate circumstances. Subsection (d) [(4)], a new provision, permits an institution to apply
        cy pres
        on its own for small funds that have existed for a substantial period of time, after giving notice to the state attorney general.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although UMIFA stated that it did not “limit the application of the doctrine of
    cy pres
    ”, UMIFA § 7(d), what that statement meant under the Act was unclear. UMIFA itself appeared to permit only a release of a restriction and not a modification. That all-or-nothing approach did not adequately protect donor intent.
        See
        Yale Univ. v. Blumenthal, 621 A.2d 1304 (Conn. 1993). By expressly including deviation and
        cy pres
        , UPMIFA requires an institution to seek modifications that are “in accordance with the donor’s probable intention” for deviation and “in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument” for
        cy pres
        .

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) [(1)]. Donor Release. Subsection (a) [(1)] permits the release of a restriction if the donor consents. A release with donor consent cannot change the charitable beneficiary of the fund. Although the donor has the power to consent to a release of a restriction, this section does not create a power in the donor that will cause a federal tax problem for the donor. The gift to the institution is a completed gift for tax purposes, the property cannot be diverted from the charitable beneficiary, and the donor cannot redirect the property to another use by the charity. The donor has no retained interest in the fund.

        Subsection (b) [(2)]. Equitable Deviation.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) [(2)]. Equitable Deviation. Subsection (b) [(2)] applies the rule of equitable deviation, adapting the language of UTC § 412 to this section. See also Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 66 (2003). Under the deviation doctrine, a court may modify restrictions on the way an institution manages or administers a fund in a manner that furthers the purposes of the fund. Deviation implements the donor’s intent. A donor commonly has a predominating purpose for a gift and, secondarily, an intent that the purpose be carried out in a particular manner. Deviation does not alter the purpose but rather modifies the means in order to carry out the purpose.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div>
       <h5 id="t33c50s33-5006-STATUTORYNOTES-subsection(c)[(3)]">
        Subsection (c) [(3)].
       </h5>
       <p>
        Sometimes deviation is needed on account of circumstances unanticipated when the donor created the restriction. In other situations the restriction may impair the management or investment of the fund. Modification of the restriction may permit the institution to carry out the donor’s purposes in a more effective manner. A court applying deviation should attempt to follow the donor’s probable intention in deciding how to modify the restriction. Consistent with the doctrine of equitable deviation in trust law, subsection (b) [(2)] does not require an institution to notify donors of the proposed modification. Good practice dictates notifying any donors who are alive and can be located with a reasonable expenditure of time and money. Consistent with the doctrine of deviation under trust law, the institution must notify the attorney general who may choose to participate in the court proceeding. The attorney general protects donor intent as well as the public’s interest in charitable assets. Attorney general is in brackets in the Act because in some states another official enforces the law of charities. Subsection (c) [(3)]. Cy Pres. Subsection (c) [(3)] applies the rule of cy pres from trust law, authorizing the court to modify the purpose of an institutional fund. The term “modify” encompasses the release of a restriction as well as an alteration of a restriction and also permits a court to order that the fund be paid to another institution. A court can apply the doctrine of cy pres only if the restriction in question has become unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful. This standard, which comes from UTC § 413, updates the circumstances under which cy pres may be applied by adding “wasteful” to the usual common law articulation of the doctrine. Any change must be made in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument. See also Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 67 (2003). Consistent with the doctrine of cy pres, subsection (c) [(3)] does not require an institution seeking cy pres to notify donors. Good practice will be to notify donors whenever possible. As with deviation, the institution must notify the attorney general who must have the opportunity to be heard in the proceeding.

        Subsection (d) [(4)]. Modification of Small, Old Funds.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (d) [(4)]. Modification of Small, Old Funds. Subsection (d)](4)] permits an institution to release or modify a restriction according to cy pres principles but without court approval if the amount of the institutional fund involved is small and if the institutional fund has been in existence for more than 20 [(10) in Idaho] years. The rationale is that under some circumstances a restriction may no longer make sense but the cost of a judicial cy pres proceeding will be too great to warrant a change in the restriction. The Drafting Committee discussed at length the parameters for allowing an institution to apply cy pres without court supervision. The Committee drafted subsection (d) [(4)] to balance the needs of an institution to serve its charitable purposes efficiently with the policy of enforcing donor intent. The Committee concluded that an institutional fund with a value of $25,000 or less is sufficiently small that the cost of a judicial proceeding will be out of proportion to its protective purpose. The Committee included a requirement that the institutional fund be in existence at least 20 [(10) in Idaho] years, as a further safeguard for fidelity to donor intent. The 20-year [10-year in Idaho] period begins to run from the date of inception of the fund and not from the date of each gift to the fund. The amount and the number of years have been placed in brackets to signal to an enacting jurisdiction that it may wish to designate a higher or lower figure. Because the amount should reflect the cost of a judicial proceeding to obtain a modification, the number may be higher in some states and lower in others.
       </p>
       <p>
        As under judicial
    cy pres
    , an institution acting under subsection (d) [(4)] must change the restriction in a manner that is in keeping with the intent of the donor and the purpose of the fund. For example, if the value of a fund is too small to justify the cost of administration of the fund as a separate fund, the term “wasteful” would allow the institution to combine the fund with another fund with similar purposes. If a fund has been created for nursing scholarships and the institution closes its nursing school, the institution might appropriately decide to use the fund for other scholarships at the institution. In using the authority granted under subsection (d) [(4)], the institution must determine which alternative use for the fund reasonably approximates the original intent of the donor. The institution cannot divert the fund to an entirely different use. For example, the fund for nursing scholarships could not be used to build a football stadium.

        Notice to Donors.
       </h5>
       <p>
        An institution seeking to modify a provision under subsection (d) [(4)] must notify the attorney general of the planned modification. The institution must wait 60 days before proceeding; the attorney general may take action if the proposed modification appears inappropriate. Notice to Donors. The Drafting Committee decided not to require notification of donors under subsections (b), (c), and (d) [(2), (3), and (4)]. The trust law rules of equitable deviation and cy pres do not require donor notification and instead depend on the court and the attorney general to protect donor intent and the public’s interest in charitable assets.
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to subsection (d) [(4)], the Drafting Committee concluded that an institution should not be required to give notice to donors. Subsection (d) [(4)] can only be used for an old and small fund. Locating a donor who contributed to the fund more than 20 [(10) in Idaho] years earlier may be difficult and expensive. If multiple donors each gave a small amount to create a fund 20 [(10) in Idaho] years earlier, the task of locating all of those donors would be harder still. The Drafting Committee concluded that an institution’s concern for donor relations would serve as a sufficient incentive for notifying donors when donors can be located.

        Charter school’s claim that a parent tortiously interfered with its responsibilities under the Idaho Public Charter Schools Act was a non-existent cause of action and unsupported by the common law, Idaho statutes, or Idaho case law, and the school could not maintain an action for libel and slander against an individual when that individual was speaking out on an issue of public concern, where the parent’s letters and criticisms, which addressed the manner in which officials at the charter school performed their duties and the school’s policies and programs, were clearly an expression of her opinion on a matter of public concern.

      33-5208. Public charter school financial support.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as provided in subsection (10) of this section, from the state educational support program the state department of education shall make the following apportionment to each public charter school for each fiscal year based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the department of education:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol11">
       Per student support. Computation of support units for each public charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school according to the schedules in section 33-1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public charter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a divisor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply, and no public charter school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the support units it received in the prior year by more than thirty (30). Funding from the state educational support program shall be equal to the total distribution factor, plus the salary-based apportionment provided in chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code. Provided however, any public charter school that is formed by the conversion of an existing traditional public school shall be assigned divisors, pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that are no lower than the divisors of the school district in which the traditional public school is located, for each category of pupils listed.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol12">
       Special education. For each student enrolled in the public charter school who is entitled to special education services, the state and federal funds from the exceptional child education program for that student that would have been apportioned for that student to the school district in which the public charter school is located.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol13">
       Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify under the provisions of sections 33-1002 and 33-1002C, Idaho Code, provided the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements, and students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule of the state board of education.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol14">
       Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public charter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and section 33-1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the department with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November, of public charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than one and one-half (1 ½) miles from the school. The state department of education is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs pursuant to section 33-1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimbursement under the provisions of section 33-1006, Idaho Code, the student to be transported must reside within the public charter school’s primary attendance area, and must meet at least one (1) of the following two (2) criteria:
       <ol Class="alpha">

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol15">
       Facilities funds. The state department of education shall distribute facilities funds to public charter schools for each enrolled student in which a majority of the student’s instruction is received at a facility that is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be used to defray the purchase, fee, loan or lease costs associated with payments for real property used by the students or employees of the public charter school for educational or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed from the moneys appropriated to the educational support program and shall be calculated as a percentage of the statewide average amount of bond and plant facility funds levied per student by Idaho school districts, as follows:
    Fiscal Year 2014
      </li>
      <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol16">
       Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a public charter school’s estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation, and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school is serving more grades or at least ten percent (10%) more classes than the previous year, to assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligations. For a public charter school entering its second or greater year of operations, the state department of education may require documentation establishing the need for such an advance payment, including comparative class schedules and proof of a commensurate increase in the number of employees.
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol16a">
         For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade level to the state department of education by June 1.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol16b">
         Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportionment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated. Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no later than July 31.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c52s33-5208ol16c">
         All subsequent payments, taking into account the onetime advance payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in accordance with the provisions of section 33-1009, Idaho Code.
    A public charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to public charter schools: that portion of section 33-1004, Idaho Code, relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff allowance and the pupil service staff allowance when there is a discrepancy between the number allowed and the number actually employed; and section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff indices.

Provided however, that each public charter school’s board of directors may direct up to ten percent (10%) of the calculated fee to pay membership fees to an organization or association that provides technical assistance, training and advocacy for Idaho public charter schools. Unless the authorized chartering entity declines payment, such fee shall be paid by March 15 of each fiscal year and shall not exceed the greater of:

       The legislature finds that there are “inherent differences between men and women,” and that these differences “remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual’s opportunity,” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996);
      </li>
      <li id="t33c62s33-6202ol12">
       These “inherent differences” range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to physiological differences;

      <li id="t33c62s33-6202ol13">
       Men generally have “denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments” and “larger hearts, greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher haemoglobin,” Neel Burton,

       Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman,

       The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural levels of testosterone, “explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,” Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, “

       While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has recognized that “sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people,”
    United States v. Virginia

       Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g.
    Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc.
    , 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (“Because of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.”);

       A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the “gender gap” between female and male performances remained stable. “These suggest that women’s performances at the high level will never match those of men.” Valerie Thibault

      (11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such treatments found that even “after 12 months of hormonal therapy,” a man who identifies as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones “had an absolute advantage” over female athletes and “will still likely have performance benefits” over women, Tommy Lundberg
    et al., “Muscle strength, size and composition following 12 months of gender-affirming treatment in transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen

      (12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors.
