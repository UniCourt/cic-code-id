        Signers of petition for removal of county seat need not be registered voters, but merely persons who are qualified to register as voters. Wilson v. Bartlett, 7 Idaho 269, 62 P. 415 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        When petition is presented to court for removal of county seat and all the signers state over their signatures that they are qualified electors of such county, petitioners make prima facie case, and no further evidence of the qualifications of such signers is required, unless a contestant appears and enters his contest. If specifications in contestant’s affidavit raise no valid objection to qualifications of any of the signers of petition, court is justified in finding, without further proof, that all of the signers of said petition are qualified electors. Wilson v. Bartlett, 7 Idaho 271, 62 P. 416 (1900).

     <p>
      Whenever the boards of county commissioners of affected counties have by joint ordinance provided that a part of an affected county be stricken off from said county and annexed to an adjoining affected county, the provisions of the constitution being complied with, the qualified electors who have resided ninety (90) days next preceding the first general election after the passage of this chapter within the boundary lines of the territory stricken off and annexed, shall be permitted to vote at said general election, for or against said annexation. If a majority of said electors voting at said election vote in favor of annexation, said territory is then stricken off and annexed, as provided in this chapter: provided, that all the requirements of the constitution have been complied with. If such annexation and change of county boundaries occur, the legislature, at its next regular session, shall redefine the boundaries of the affected counties as set forth in the Idaho Code to conform therewith. The county recorder of the county from which the territory is to be detached may have clearly reproduced by photographing or filming in accordance with the provisions of sections 9-328, 9-329 and 9-330[, Idaho Code], into permanent records, all instruments, papers and other matters and things relating to or affecting real property in the territory being detached and annexed. When the costs have been determined for the transcribing and indexing of all instruments, documents, records, maps, papers, and all other matters relating to or affecting the property in the territory to be annexed which must be transferred to the annexing county, and the copying and preparing for transfer of all pleadings, court records, and other papers in all court actions and court proceedings to be transferred to annexing county, the board of county commissioners of the county annexing the detached territory shall cause county warrants to be drawn to pay all such costs; said warrants so drawn shall be paid by a tax to be assessed upon all property within the territory being annexed.

     <p>
      The floating indebtedness of the counties so consolidated, existing and owing at the time the consolidation becomes effective, evidenced by warrants, orders, tax anticipation notes or bonds, and claims outstanding and unpaid, and bond interest coupons maturing prior to said date, shall be determined by the respective county auditors of said counties, and the amount and details thereof certified to the board of commissioners of the county with which the consolidation has been effected. All money in the possession or under the control of the treasurer or other officer of the county which has been consolidated (except school district, road district, highway district, city, village and other municipal funds) shall be paid over to the treasurer of the other county and by the latter applied upon said floating indebtedness of the county which has been consolidated. If any balance remains after the payment of such floating indebtedness, such balance shall be apportioned to the current expense fund of the consolidated county. If such money and credits shall be insufficient to pay such floating indebtedness, as aforesaid, such deficiency shall be met, provided for and paid by levy made on the taxable property in the territory of the county which has been consolidated, such levy to be made and to be payable as other levies for the redemption and payment of indebtedness of like character. In like manner, any amount of such floating indebtedness of the county with which the consolidation has been effected, over and above the moneys in the possession or under the control of the treasurer or other officer of such county (except school district, road district, highway district, village, city and other municipal funds) at the time the consolidation becomes effective, shall be met, provided for and paid by levy on the taxable property in the territory of such county as it existed prior to consolidation.
     </p>

      The bonded indebtedness of the respective counties, existing at the time the consolidation becomes effective, shall be met, provided for and paid as if no consolidation had been effected, the taxable property in the territory of each county, as it formerly existed, remaining liable therefor as before; and the same rule shall apply in the case of any refunding issue or issues.

        This section was amended by two 1989 acts, ch. 65, § 1 and ch. 93, § 2, both effective July 1, 1989 — which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1989 amendment, by ch. 65, inserted “or if the board determines that county affairs require regular meetings more often, then at such times as may be provided for in advance by ordinance” and substituted “has been addressed” for “is disposed of” in the former first paragraph (now subsection (1)) in the first sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1989 amendment, by ch. 93, designated the former first paragraph as subsection (1) and added subsections (2) — (4) which were formerly<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t31c07s31-711" target="_self">§§ 31-711 </a></cite>— 31-713 respectively.

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 99, rewrote subsection (3), which formerly read: “ If at any time after the adjournment of a regular meeting the business of the county requires a meeting of the board, a special meeting may be ordered by a majority of the board. The order must be entered of record, and five (5) days’ notice thereof must, by the clerk, be given to each member not joining in the order. The order must specify the business to be transacted, and none other than that specified must be transacted at such special meeting”; and deleted the former second sentence in subsection (4), which read: “The clerk of the board must give five (5) days’ public notice of all special or adjourned meetings, stating the business to be transacted, by posting three (3) notices in conspicuous places, one (1) of which shall be at the courthouse door”. Legislative Intent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2017, ch. 99 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify which meeting notification requirements apply to boards of county commissioners. Section 31-710, Idaho Code, requires a county to provide five days’ notice for special meetings. On the other hand, Section 74-204, Idaho Code, requires only a twenty-four hour notice for special meetings. In determining which notice requirement applied to these special meetings, the Idaho Supreme Court in
    Nelson v. Boundary County
    , 109 Idaho 205, 208 (Ct. App. 1985) held that the twenty-four hour provision applied because that notice provision was enacted later in time. By enacting this legislation, the Legislature intends to remove any confusion and to clarify that the notice requirements of Chapter 2, Title 74, Idaho Code, apply to county commissioners”.

        Only difference between adjourned and special meeting is that an adjourned meeting is a meeting to be provided for while board is in session by proper order, said meeting to be held after the close of the regular session; a special meeting is a meeting called upon order of a majority of board after close of the regular session, to be held at such time as the order may fix.

        As the legislative arm of county government, the board of county commissioners has both express and implied power to promulgate ordinances, rules and regulations, which, in the judgment of the board, promote the general welfare of the county. Hansen v. White, 114 Idaho 907, 762 P.2d 820 (1988).

        Livestock Control.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In the absence of a state legislative enactment clearly indicating that livestock must be free to roam the lands of Idaho uninhibited by the ownership or character of the lands, counties and municipalities may validly exercise their police powers to prohibit such free roaming livestock. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that compliance with ordinance prohibiting livestock from roaming would be burdensome in that livestock owners would be required to spend large sums of money in fencing their lands did not render the ordinance unreasonable and arbitrary. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        County ordinance prohibiting livestock from running loose was without force and effect within the limits of the incorporated municipalities located in the county; however, this did not invalidate the ordinance nor make it ineffective in the balance of the county. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        County ordinance prohibiting livestock from running at large was not invalid as extending application of the ordinance beyond the geographical limits of the county, since the ordinance did not purport to, nor could it, affect or regulate matters occurring outside such county; should livestock from outside the county wander into lands within the county, they would then come under the jurisdiction of the county and be subject to its valid ordinances; and the fact that their owners might reside outside the county would not alter the result. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if it be assumed for the purpose of discussion that the herd district statutes in some degree addressed the same problems as those addressed by a county ordinance prohibiting livestock from roaming, local enactments which merely extend the state law by way of additional restrictions or limitations are not invalid. Benewah County Cattlemen’s Ass’n v. Board of County Comm’rs, 105 Idaho 209, 668 P.2d 85 (1983).

        Board of county commissioners is a tribunal created by statute, with limited jurisdiction, and only quasi-judicial powers, and cannot act except in strict accordance with the statute. Gorman v. Board of County Comm’rs, 1 Idaho 553, appeal dismissed, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 661, 22 L. Ed. 226 (1873).

        Board of county commissioners is vested with a discretionary power, and exercises the higher and superior power in the matter of granting licenses within an incorporated city. Anderson v. Board of County Comm’rs, 22 Idaho 190, 125 P. 188 (1912).

        Where statutes of the state impose certain duties upon board of county commissioners, and require certain reports and performance of certain duties, county commissioners have no right or authority to exercise the arbitrary judgment that such reports are unnecessary and impracticable. It is the duty of a public officer to obey the law, and he cannot justify his acts upon the ground that he does not believe that it will be necessary to obey. Robinson v. Huffaker, 23 Idaho 173, 129 P. 334 (1912); Crowley v. Empey, 23 Idaho 190, 129 P. 340 (1912).

Odd-lot property may be sold to an adjacent property owner for fair market value that is estimated by a land appraiser licensed to appraise property in the state of Idaho. If, after thirty (30) days’ written notice, an adjoining property owner or owners do not desire to purchase the odd-lot property, the board of county commissioners may sell the property to any other interested party for not less than the appraised value. When a sale of odd-lot property is agreed to, a public advertisement of the pending sale shall be published in one (1) edition of the newspaper as defined in subsection (1) of this section, and the public shall have fifteen (15) days to object to the sale in writing.

Notice of such grant or exchange shall be as provided in subsection (1) of this section and the decision may be made at any regularly or specially scheduled meeting of the board of county commissioners. The execution and delivery by the county of the deed conveying an interest in the property shall operate to discharge and cancel all levies, liens and taxes made or created for the benefit of the state, county or any other political subdivision or taxing district and to cancel all titles or claims of title including claims of redemption to such real property asserted or existing at the time of such conveyance. However, if the property conveyed is subject to a lien for one (1) or more unsatisfied special assessments, the lien shall continue until all special assessments have been paid in full. At no time shall a lien for a special assessment be extinguished prior to such special assessment having been paid in full. Any property conveyed to any local historical society by the county shall revert to the county when the property is no longer utilized for the purposes for which it was conveyed.

      If the property to be sold is acquired by tax deed, the notice required to be published shall include, next to the description of the property, the name of the taxpayer as it appears in the delinquent tax certificate upon which the tax deed was issued. The property shall be sold to the highest bidder. However, the board of county commissioners shall set the minimum bid for the tax deeded property to include all property taxes owing, interest and costs but they may reserve the right to reject any and all bids and shall have discretionary authority to reject or accept any bid which may be made for an amount less than the total amount of all delinquent taxes, late charges, interest and costs, including other costs associated with the property, advertising, and sale, which may have accrued against any property so offered for sale, including the amount specified in the tax deed to the county. Such action by the board in setting the minimum bid shall be duly noted in their minutes. Failure to do so shall not invalidate a sale. For tax deeded property, the board of county commissioners shall conduct an auction no later than fourteen (14) months from the issuance of the tax deed.

        This section was amended by two 2003 acts — ch. 58, § 1, and ch. 68, § 1, both effective July 1, 2003 — which do not conflict and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2003 amendment, by ch. 58, § 1, added present subsection (10).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2003 amendment, by ch. 68, § 1, deleted former subsection (10).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 397, in the last paragraph in subsection (1), in the third sentence, inserted “shall set the minimum bid for the tax deeded property to include all property taxes owing, interest and costs but they” and “including other costs associated with the property, advertising, and sale,” and substituted “interest and costs” for “costs and interest,” and added the last three sentences; added the paragraph (2)(a) and (2)(b) designations, and in paragraph (2)(b), substituted the language beginning “payment of all delinquent taxes” for “reimbursement to the county for the cost of advertising and sale, shall be apportioned to the taxing districts in which the property is situated according to the levy applied to the year of delinquency upon which the tax deed was issued to the county”; and added paragraph (2)(c) and subsection (11).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2016 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 211, in paragraph (2)(c), added “Within sixty (60) days of the date a claim on the proceeds is due” at the beginning of the fourth sentence, substituted “or shall transfer the funds to the state treasurer as set forth in paragraph (d) of this subsection” for “within sixty (60) days” at the end of the fourth sentence, and added “or transferred to the state treasurer” at the end of the fifth sentence; added paragraph (d) and deleted subsection (11), which formerly read: “ If there are excess funds and the owner(s) of record of the property at the time the tax deed was issued on the property cannot be located, then the county treasurer shall put all remaining excess funds in an interest-bearing trust for three (3) years. The county may charge for the actual costs for performing the search, and after three (3) years, any remaining funds shall be transferred to the county indigent fund. The levy set to fund this portion of the indigent budget shall be calculated based on the budget subject to the limitation in section 63-802, Idaho Code, less the money received from the interest-bearing trust”.
    The 2016 amendment, by ch. 273, added “but excluding easements, highways, and rights-of-way owned by the county, unless expressly conveyed” at the end of subsection (4).

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2016, ch. 273 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify the scope and effect of Idaho’s statutes governing tax deeds. In the case of
    Regan v. Owen
    , the Idaho Supreme Court addressed whether a tax deed issued pursuant to Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, has the effect of extinguishing an otherwise valid private easement across the subject property. Similar legislative language exists with respect to counties in Section 31-808, Idaho Code, with respect to irrigation entities in Section 43-720, Idaho Code, and with respect to cities in Section 50-1823, Idaho Code. The court did not decide the issue, but remanded to a lower court. The lower court subsequently ruled that, despite the harsh result, the statute has this effect. While a private access easement was at issue there, the reasoning would also result in the elimination of public utility easements, ditch rights, public highways and rights-of-way, conservation easements, and all manner of third-party rights in the land including, for example, interests of remaindermen following a life estate. By this legislation, the Idaho Legislature rejects that conclusion. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow local governments to destroy valid property interests held by third parties in land that is subject to a sale or other conveyance based on a tax delinquency, except where notice and opportunity to cure is provided under the statute. Doing so would constitute an uncompensated taking of property under both the Idaho Constitution and the United States Constitution. The Legislature would never have intended such a result and, by this legislation, makes that clear. As its context should have made evident, the purpose of Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, and the other referenced sections, has always been to convey title absolutely free and clear of liens and mortgages of a monetary nature. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow a local governmental entity to convey more than the delinquent taxpayer owned and thereby to destroy valid property interests held by others without notice and an opportunity to cure. This clarification brings the interpretation of Idaho’s tax deed statute into line with the interpretation of similar statutes in other jurisdictions, as had always been the Legislature’s intent.”

        Section 8 of S.L. 2016, ch. 273 provided: “An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its passage and approval. Being a clarification of existing law, the Legislature does not view the application of this amendment to prior conveyances as retroactive legislation. In any event, the Legislature expressly intends that these amendments shall be interpreted to apply to any and all conveyances by tax deed, past or future.”

      Where in the discretion of the commissioners it is desirable, they are hereby authorized to make contracts of insurance with any insurance company authorized to transact business within the state providing for insurance against loss by fire, and against any and all hazards on any or all property belonging to the county, including insurance to cover liability for damages to property and for bodily injury arising as a result of the ownership, operation or use of county vehicles. In consideration of the premium at which any such policy shall be written, it shall be a part of the policy contract between the county and the insurance company that the insurance company shall not be entitled to the defense of governmental immunity of the insured. Immunity of the county, against liability damages, is hereby waived to the extent of the liability insurance carried by the county on such vehicles. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the making of such contracts of insurance by the commissioners on behalf of the county; provided that the board may create or participate in a self-insured risk program.

        A county commissioner who was killed when his automobile was struck by a train on his way from his home to county seat to attend a meeting of a board was at the time pursuing the “course of his employment,” and therefore his death was compensable in view of the statute which defined actual and necessary expenses which a county is required to pay to a commissioner, as traveling and hotel expenses incurred by the commissioner when absent from his residence in the performance of his official duties, thereby indicating a legislative recognition of the fact that the commissioner would have to travel in the discharge of his official duties.

        Actual circulation of a newspaper is not decisive that effective notice is given, since the spread or diffusion throughout the county may prove more effective notice than a much larger circulation confined mostly to one town. Robinson v. Latah County, 56 Idaho 759, 59 P.2d 19 (1936).

        Where there is a controversy between two newspapers as to which one would most likely give effective notice of county proceedings, circulation of the particular newspaper to which the board of county commissioners awards county printing and circulation of newspaper contesting the award are the only circulations which can be considered, and circulation of two separate newspapers cannot be combined.

      The board of commissioners may grant to any county officer of their respective counties leave of absence from their county and the state, for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days, during which time the absence of such officer does not work forfeiture of his office; provided, that before the granting of such leave of absence, the officer (except county commissioners) must appoint a deputy to perform the duties of his office, as by statute in such cases made and provided, and must present to, and file with, the board of commissioners of his county the written consent of each person liable on his official bond, that such leave of absence be granted; be it further provided, that no leave of absence shall be granted to more than any one (1) county commissioner at the same time; providing, however, that where any elective or appointive county officer is required to absent himself by reason of being a member of the armed forces of the nation or by reason of official call to service in civilian war work, such period of absence shall not exceed the date of the next succeeding general election, such absence shall not work forfeiture of the office of such officer, and such absence shall suspend the salary of such officer during such period, except that the board may adopt a policy by which such officer may, for periods of absence not to exceed four (4) weeks per year, receive his or her regular salary reduced by an amount equal to any monetary compensation received for the performance of such military or civilian war work. For purposes of this section, appointive county officers do not include deputies appointed pursuant to section 31-2003, Idaho Code.

And, provided further, that no part of the provisions of this section shall be construed to prevent the board of county commissioners, from entering into a lease for courthouse premises, rooms and jail for any period in their discretion, not to exceed thirty (30) years, and provided that the county commissioners may contract with responsible parties for the leasing of a courthouse, jail and hospital, or a combination of courthouse, jail and hospital, or fairground buildings and facilities, to be constructed upon premises owned by the county or otherwise, provided that said contract shall be let subject to the provisions of chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code; the contract also may provide that at the expiration of the term of the lease, upon full performance of such lease by the county, the said courthouse premises, rooms and jail, fairground buildings and facilities, or so much thereof as is leased, may become the property of the county. The board must also provide all necessary books of record for the county auditor and recorder, county treasurer, county assessor, and tax collector, clerk of the district court, county surveyor, and the books and stationery for the use of the board, and so much as is necessary for the use of said county officers in the transaction of official business.

       In lieu of the issuance of bonds for the purpose specified in section 31-1002, Idaho Code, the board of county commissioners of any county shall have power, in addition to the power specified in said section 31-1002, Idaho Code, when in their judgment the best interests of the county so required, to create and establish a fund for the purpose specified in said section 31-1002, Idaho Code, and for said purposes are hereby authorized and empowered, by resolution adopted at a regular meeting of said board, or at any special meeting called for that purpose, to levy, in addition to all other taxes now authorized by law, an annual tax of not exceeding six hundredths percent (.06%) of market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property in such county for the current year, to be certified, extended and collected at the same time and in the same manner as taxes for general county purposes, and to be apportioned, when collected, to a special fund to be known as the “County Building Construction Fund,” provided, that in the resolution and for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned such board shall call an election, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, or submit, at any general election, the question of creating such fund to defray the expenses of purchasing such site and erecting and furnishing such buildings, at which election only such electors may vote as are qualified to vote at elections held for the issuance of general obligation bonds, and which election shall in all respects be governed and held in the same manner as is now required by law for the holding of elections to determine the question of the issuance of general obligation bonds. If, at such election two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified voters voting at such election shall have voted to create such funds, then such board of county commissioners may annually levy the taxes for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned. Such fund shall remain intact, subject to investment as hereinafter provided, until the same shall, when augmented by the proceeds of similar levies in succeeding years, be adequate in the judgment of such board to defray the entire cost of purchasing a site and constructing the improvements aforesaid and completely furnishing the same, and no part of such fund shall be expended until complete plans and specifications have been adopted and contracts entered into insuring the completion of such purchase and construction within the limitations of such fund, nor shall the construction of any courthouse or jail be undertaken until such fund is adequate to insure the proper equipment and furnishing thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c10s31-1008ol12">
       Notwithstanding the limitations imposed in subsection (1) of this section, the board of county commissioners may create a fund upon a finding by the board that a critical need exists for justice or law enforcement related facilities. The board may deposit any unexpended sums from the county current expense fund or the county justice fund into the county building construction fund or may deposit into the fund all or a part of any non-ad valorem tax revenues not otherwise restricted or dedicated by law. On or before the thirty-first day of March of each odd-numbered year, the board may review the budget for the current fiscal year and adjust the expenditures in the budget to provide for deposits into the fund from revenues not otherwise budgeted or to provide for deposits into the fund from revenues projected to be surplus over budgeted revenues. The adjustments may be made only after a notice is given and a public hearing is held substantially similar to that contained in section 31-1604, Idaho Code. After the creation of the fund, the board may, in strict compliance with section 63-802, Idaho Code, deposit any amount into the fund on an annual basis.
    (3) Provided, that no such fund shall be accumulated in excess of two per cent (2%) of the assessed valuation of the property within such county; provided further, that such fund may be used to supplement the proceeds of any bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of sections 31-1002 and 31-1004, Idaho Code, for the purposes aforesaid.

     <p>
      After the organization of a fire protection district, additional contiguous or noncontiguous territory lying within the same county may be added thereto and shall thereupon and thenceforth be included in such district. Territory that is not contained in an existing fire district, and is not immediately adjoining the boundaries of the fire district into which annexation is sought, may be annexed into the district provided the territory consists of not less than forty (40) contiguous acres. At least seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the owners or contract purchasers of the land sought to be annexed shall petition the fire protection board and request annexation of the territory particularly described in said petition. Upon receipt of any such petition the fire protection board shall hold a hearing not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days thereafter, or upon the written consent of the petitioner within one hundred eighty (180) days, and said board shall cause notice of such hearing, designating the time and place, to be published in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper of general circulation within the district. Any person supporting or objecting to such petition shall be heard at such hearing, if in attendance, and at the close of such hearing said board shall approve or reject said petition. If the board approves said petition it shall make an order to that effect and certify a copy of said order containing an accurate legal description of the annexed territory to the board of county commissioners of the county where said fire district is situated. Said board of county commissioners shall thereupon enter an order of annexation and cause the same to be recorded so as to include the annexed property on the tax rolls as in this chapter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the owners or contract purchasers of the land sought to be annexed do not join in said petition, and the board determines by resolution entered on the minutes of the board, that the annexation would be in the best interests of the district and that an election on the issue should be held, additional territory may nevertheless be annexed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified electors of such additional territory voting on the question at an election held therefor, which vote may be taken at an election held as provided in section 31-1405, Idaho Code. The same procedure shall be adopted as provided in sections 31-1402 through 31-1406, Idaho Code.

      § 31-1420. Procedure for sale, conveyance and disposition of property.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Real or personal property of a fire protection district may be sold, conveyed and disposed of by its board of commissioners whenever the board finds and by resolution declares that the district no longer has use therefor, subject to the following procedure:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c14s31-1420ol11">
       If in the opinion of the board any such personal property does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in value, the same may be sold without independent valuations, notice or competitive bids.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c14s31-1420ol12">
       If in the opinion of the board any such personal property exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in value, then the board shall select two (2) individuals independent of the board who have the knowledge and expertise to determine the value of the personal property to assess the value of the property. The property may then be sold at public or private sale to the highest bidder for cash at not less than its minimum valuation, after due notice. If the property cannot be sold for the minimum valuation after reasonable efforts have been made, the board may then sell the property for adequate and valuable consideration as determined by the board. Any individual selected by the board to assess the value of personal property shall not be eligible to acquire that property.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c14s31-1420ol13">
       All such real property shall be appraised by a certified appraiser who shall be selected by the board. It may then be exchanged for other real property of equivalent value as determined by the board or sold at public or private sale to the highest bidder for cash at not less than its appraised value, after due notice. If the property cannot be sold for the appraised value after reasonable efforts have been made, the board may then sell the property for adequate and valuable consideration as determined by the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c14s31-1420ol14">
       Due notice of sale shall be accomplished if the notice describes the property to be sold (legal description, if real property), states the appraised value thereof (by separate items, if so appraised), and specifies the time, place and conditions of sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c14s31-1420ol15">
       The notice shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the district at least twice, the first publication thereof to be not less than fifteen (15) days preceding the day of sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c14s31-1420ol16">
       If such property is sold on terms, the board may contract for the sale of the same for a period of years not exceeding ten (10) years, with an annual rate of interest on all deferred payments not to exceed twelve percent (12%) per annum. The title to all property sold on contract shall be retained in the name of the district until full payment has been made by the purchaser. Any property sold by the board under the provisions of this section, either for cash or on contract, shall be assessed by the county assessor in the same manner and upon the same basis of valuation as though the purchaser held a record title to the property so sold. The board shall have authority to cancel any contract of sale, pursuant to law, if the purchaser shall fail to comply with any of the terms of such contract, and retain all payments paid thereon. The board may by agreement with the purchaser modify or extend any of the terms of any contracts of sale, but the total period of years shall not exceed ten (10) years.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c14s31-1420ol17">
       Upon final payment pursuant to the sale of such real property, the president and secretary, pursuant to resolution of the board, shall duly execute and deliver an appropriate deed to the purchaser, and upon the accomplishment of the sale of such personal property, the president and secretary, pursuant to resolution of the board, shall duly execute and deliver an appropriate bill of sale to the purchaser.
    (8) In addition to any other powers granted by law, the board of fire commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to or exchange with the federal government, the state of Idaho, any political subdivision, or taxing district of the state of Idaho, with or without compensation, any real or personal property or any interest in such property owned by the fire district or acquired by tax deed, after adoption of a resolution that the grant or exchange of property is in the public interest. Such resolution may be made at any regularly or specially scheduled meeting of the board. Notice of such grant or exchange shall be made in the same manner as set forth in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. The fire protection district’s execution and delivery of the deed conveying an interest in the property shall operate to discharge and cancel all levies, liens and taxes made or created for the benefit of the fire protection district and to cancel all titles or claims of title including claims of redemption to such real property asserted or existing at the time of such conveyance.

       Each year, immediately prior to the annual county levy of taxes, the board of commissioners of each fire protection district, organized and existing under this chapter, may levy a tax upon all the taxable property within the boundaries of such district sufficient to defray the cost of equipping and maintaining the district of twenty-four hundredths percent (.24%) of market value for assessment purposes, to be used for the purposes of this chapter and for no other purpose. The levy shall be made by resolution entered upon the minutes of the board of commissioners of the fire protection district, and it shall be the duty of the secretary of the district, immediately after entry of the resolution in the minutes, to transmit to the county auditor and the county assessor certified copies of the resolution providing for such levy.

In determining such recommended levy rate, the commissioners shall recommend a levy rate that shall be sufficient to defray the cost of equipping and maintaining the new consolidated district. If such recommended levy rate exceeds by more than three percent (3%) the lowest current district levy rate of any of the districts to be consolidated, an election shall be held in a manner consistent with the provisions of section 31-1414, Idaho Code. In such election, the electors residing in the fire protection districts seeking to consolidate shall vote to approve or disapprove the recommended levy rate and the proposed consolidation of districts.

      The aforesaid ordinance shall also provide for holding an election with the notice in compliance with section 34-1406, Idaho Code.

     <p>
      Fire protection districts subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth may, pursuant to the discretion of the fire protection board, contract with individual property owners whose property is situated outside of the external boundaries of the fire protection district within the state of Idaho or within any neighboring state to provide for the same measure of fire protection to such contracting property owner as is provided to property owners within the boundaries of such contracting fire protection districts. All such contracts shall be for a term of one (1) year and shall commence at 12:01 a.m. on January 1 of such year and expire at 12 midnight on December 31 of such year. Contracts shall provide for a monetary consideration to be paid in advance by such property owner and the monetary consideration shall be based upon the cost of providing such service to such property owner, including, but not limited to, covering the district’s administrative and contract preparation costs, including legal fees for preparation and review of the contracts, and shall also take into consideration the distance between such property and the fire station or other facility wherein the firefighting equipment of such fire protection district is kept. Monetary consideration shall in no event be less than the amount that would have been paid in taxes that would have been levied and assessed under the provisions of this chapter, if such property had been included within the boundaries of said fire protection district. The power herein granted is subject to the limitation that no such contract may be entered into with any property owner whose house and outbuildings are situate further distant from the firehouse or other facility wherein such district’s fire protection equipment is kept than the point on the external boundary of such district that is furthest distant from the firehouse or other facility wherein such district’s fire protection equipment is kept. Provided further, however, that all of the contiguous lands of any contracting property owner must be included in said contract unless a portion of such property owner’s lands are further distant from the firehouse where such district’s firefighting equipment is kept than the point on the external boundary of such fire protection district that is furthest distant from the firehouse, in which case such portion of said lands must be excluded. For the purpose of determining value of eligible property situate outside the state of Idaho, the board of commissioners of such fire protection district shall determine as nearly as possible what the assessed value of such lands outside the state of Idaho would be if the same were situate within the state of Idaho.

      § 31-1434. Any dissolution.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Dissolution of any fire protection district organized under this chapter may be initiated by a petition signed by at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the holders of title, or evidence of title, to the real property within the fire protection district, requesting dissolution of such fire protection district, in the following manner:
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall first be presented to the board of county commissioners of each county in which the fire protection district is situated, signed by the number of holders of title or evidence of title above provided, which petition shall clearly designate the boundaries of the fire protection district and shall state the name of the district and shall be accompanied by a map thereof. The petition, together with all maps and other papers filed therewith, shall, at proper hours, be open to public inspection in the office of the clerk of the board of county commissioners between the date of their said filing and the date of the election on the question of districts as hereafter provided. The petition may be in one (1) or in several papers. When such petition is presented to the board of county commissioners, and filed in the office of the clerk of the board, the said board shall set a time for hearing of such petition, which time shall not be less than four (4) nor more than six (6) weeks from the date of the presenting and filing of said petition. A notice of the time of such hearing shall be published by said board, once a week for three (3) successive weeks previous to the time set for such hearing, in a newspaper published within the county in which said district is situated. Said notice shall give the boundaries of the fire protection district and shall state that a petition has been filed to dissolve the same, and that on the date fixed for the hearing, any taxpayer within the district, may appear at the hearing and testify and/or present exhibits upon any issue pertaining to the proposed dissolution of the fire district, or may object to or support the proposed dissolution.
     </p>
     <p>
      After hearing and considering any and all testimony and other evidence either made in favor of or in opposition to the dissolution of the fire district, if the board of county commissioners makes a sufficient factual finding that the majority of the residents of the fire district will receive no benefit by continuing the existence of the fire district, the county commissioners shall make an order granting the petition, with or without modification. Provided however, the board of county commissioners, after hearing and considering all testimony and other evidence either in favor of or in opposition to the dissolution of the fire district, cannot make a sufficient factual finding that the majority of the residents of the fire district will receive no benefit by continuing the existence of the fire district, the county commissioners shall make an order denying the petition. After the county commissioners have entered their order approving or denying such petition, the clerk of the board of county commissioners shall cause to be published, a notice of election to be held in such proposed fire protection district, for the purpose of determining whether or not the same shall be dissolved. Such notice shall plainly and clearly designate the boundaries of the fire protection district, its name, and further, that the election is to be held to decide the question of whether the fire protection district shall be maintained or dissolved. Such notice shall be published once in each week for three (3) successive publications prior to such election, in a newspaper published within the county aforesaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such notice shall require the electors to cast ballots which shall contain the words “fire protection district dissolved .... yes” or: “fire protection district dissolved .... no” or words equivalent thereto. No person shall be entitled to vote at any election held under the provisions of this chapter, unless he shall possess all the qualifications required of electors under the general laws of the state and be a resident of the district.
    The election qualifications of electors and canvass of the ballots shall be made in the same manner as provided for in sections 31-1406 and 31-1407, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of the electors voting at such election shall vote to dissolve the fire protection district, the board of county commissioners shall, after certifying the results of such election, enter an order upon the minutes of its official proceedings dissolving said fire protection district, and such district shall thereupon be dissolved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, that whenever a petition requesting dissolution of a fire protection district is signed by the holders of title, or evidence of title, to all of the real property included within the fire protection district and is presented to the board of county commissioners of the county in which the fire protection district is situated, accompanied by a map clearly designating the boundaries of the district, the board of county commissioners shall set a time for hearing of such petition, which time shall not be less than four (4) nor more than six (6) weeks from the date of the presenting and filing of said petition. A notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published by said board once a week for three (3) successive weeks previous to such hearing, in a newspaper published within the county in which the fire protection district is situated. Said notice shall give the boundaries of the fire protection district and shall state that a petition has been filed to dissolve the same, and that on the date fixed for the hearing, any resident, taxpayer, or creditor of such fire protection district may appear and offer any objection to the dissolving of the fire protection district. If at such hearing, no protests are made to the granting of the petition, the board of county commissioners shall enter an order upon the minutes of its official proceedings dissolving such fire protection district, and such district shall thereupon be dissolved. If, however, any protests from residents, taxpayers, or creditors of the district are entered at such hearing, the board of county commissioners shall, within thirty (30) days of said hearing, determine whether or not such fire protection district shall be dissolved and shall cause an order to that effect to be entered upon the minutes of its official proceedings. If the board determines that the fire protection district shall be dissolved, such dissolution shall be effective as of the date of the entry of such order upon the minutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The property of such district shall remain the property of the county in which such district is located and any money remaining in the fund of such district shall be expended in the maintenance and repair of the highways of such district whether such highways at the time of the dissolution, are in the incorporated territory or in unincorporated territory.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the district is situated in two (2) or more counties, each board of county commissioners shall coordinate the hearing date and the publications of notice so that only one (1) hearing need be held. Unless otherwise agreed to by each board of county commissioners involved, the hearing shall be held at the administrative offices of the district, and the boards of county commissioners are hereby specifically authorized to act in a joint manner for such purposes. If an election is called, the boards of county commissioners shall provide that the election be held on the same day in each county, and the boards of county commissioners shall coordinate the canvass of the votes cast and make one (1) joint announcement. If a majority of votes in any county are against the dissolution of the district, such rejection shall void the dissolution of the district in all counties.

        A board of commissioners is forbidden to pay a claim asserted against it until certain procedures are followed.

      When the board finds that any claim presented is not payable by the county, or is not a proper county charge, it must be rejected. If they find it to be a proper county charge, but greater in amount than is justly due, the board may allow the claim in part and draw a warrant for the portion allowed, on the claimant filing a receipt in full for his account.

        The board of commissioners was forbidden to pay a claim asserted against it until certain procedures were followed.

    Remedy to correct errors and irregularities in action of board of commissioners acting in a matter over which such board had jurisdiction was solely by appeal. Where board, in violation of the Constitution, incurred a large debt in excess of the revenues for the fiscal year, without submitting such question to voters, such board was not acting within its jurisdiction, and action was void and could be attacked directly, indirectly or collaterally at any time or place.

A statement of the statutory grounds was not required under either Idaho R. Civ.

     </p>
     <p>
      On or before the first Monday in May of each year the county budget officer shall notify, in writing, each county official, elective or appointive, in charge of any office, department, service, agency or institution of the county, to file with such budget officer, on or before the third Monday in May thereafter, an itemized estimate showing both the probable revenues from sources other than taxation that will accrue to his office, department, service, agency or institution during the fiscal year, to which the budget is intended to apply, and all expenditures required by such office, department, service, agency, or institution, for the same period, together with a brief explanatory statement of the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said estimates and reports shall be submitted upon forms furnished by the budget officer showing the entire revenues and expenditures under each classification and subdivision thereof the two (2) preceding fiscal years, the amount actually received and expended to the second Monday of April of the current fiscal year, and the estimated total receipts and expenditures for the current fiscal year and show any and all estimated balances, at the end of the current fiscal year, in any appropriation available and applicable to the functions performed by such office, department, service, agency or institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said estimates of probable expenditures shall be under classifications set by the board of county commissioners, to include, at a minimum, the “Salaries, Benefits, and Detail of Other Expenses.”

     <p>
      If any county official, elective or appointive, in charge of any office, department, service, agency or institution has had, or contemplates having, any expenditures, the reports of which can not be properly made under any of the above classifications, the same shall be reported in detail in addition to the information provided for in said forms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any official or employee failing or refusing to furnish said estimates or information within the time hereinabove provided shall pay a penalty of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than fifty dollars ($50.00) as may be determined by order of the board of county commissioners, said penalty to be deducted by the county auditor from the next salary warrant due such official or employee and credited to the current expense fund of said county.

        Elected officials (auditor, treasurer, sheriff, assessor) had standing to challenge whether a taxpayer coalition’s referendum and initiative were the proper means to reject an ad valorem tax levy and establish a budget process for a county where the elected officials established that they would suffer a “distinct palpable injury” if the referendum and initiative passed because they would be unable to perform their lawful duties.

      On or before the Tuesday following the first Monday in September of each year the board of county commissioners shall meet at the time and place designated in said notice. Any taxpayer may appear and be heard upon any part or parts of said tentative budget. Such hearing may be continued from day to day but must be concluded by the second Monday in September. Any officer or employee in charge of any office, department, service, agency or institution of the county may be called before said board at the time the estimates for his office, department, service, agency or institution are under consideration and be examined by said board or any taxpayer concerning the expenditures made by him and the estimated expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the conclusion of such hearing, the county commissioners shall fix and determine the amount of the budget, which in no event shall be greater than the amount of the tentative budget or include an amount to be raised from property taxes greater than the amount advertised, and by resolution adopt the budget and enter said resolution on the official minutes of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said budget as finally adopted for the ensuing fiscal year shall specify the fund or funds against which warrants shall be issued for the expenditures so authorized, respectively, and the aggregate of expenditures authorized against any fund shall not exceed the estimated revenues to accrue to such fund during the ensuing fiscal year from sources other than taxation together with any balances and plus revenues to be derived from taxation for such ensuing fiscal year, within the limitations imposed by chapter 8 of title 63, Idaho Code, or by any statutes of the state of Idaho in force and effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thereafter, at the time provided by law, the board of county commissioners shall fix the levies for the ensuing fiscal year necessary to raise the amount of expenditures as determined by the adopted budget, less the total estimated revenues from sources other than taxation, including available surplus, not subject to the provisions of section 31-1605A, Idaho Code, as determined by the board, and such expenditures as are to be made with the proceeds of authorized bond issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the year the county commissioners may proceed to adjust the budget as adopted to reflect the receipt of unscheduled revenue, grants, or donations from federal, state or local governments or private sources, provided that there shall be no increase in anticipated property taxes. The annual budget procedure shall be complied with as nearly as practicable before the budget may be adjusted.

In the event of any unforeseen contingency arising, which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of making the budget, and which shall require the expenditure of money not provided for in the budget, the board of county commissioners, by unanimous vote thereof, shall have the right to make an appropriation from the “general reserve appropriation” to the office, department, service, agency or institution in which said contingency arises, in such amount as shall be determined by resolution of said board.

      Counties may accumulate fund balances at the end of a fiscal year and carry over such fund balances into the ensuing fiscal year sufficient to achieve or maintain county operations on a cash basis. A fund balance is the excess of the assets of a fund over its liabilities and reserves. Upon resolution by the board of county commissioners, such funds may be carried over for the use of specific county departments as an additional appropriation in the next fiscal year.

        Section 15 of S.L. 1931, ch. 122, providing for repeal of former and inconsistent laws, is as follows: “Chapter 232, the Idaho Session Laws, 1927, as amended by chapter 138 of the Idaho Session Laws, 1929, is hereby repealed; provided that as to the current fiscal year, the provisions thereof shall remain in full force and effect except as herein above provided.

        Section 14 of S.L. 1931, ch. 122, providing time for said act to take effect, is as follows: “Inasmuch as this act provides the method for making the estimates of receipts and expenditures of the various offices, departments, services, agencies and institutions of the counties of this state, the preparation of a tentative budget and the adoption of a final budget, much of which information must be furnished before the beginning of the fiscal year, and inasmuch as this act could not be complied with for the current fiscal year which began on the second Monday of January, 1931, it is hereby declared the provisions of this act shall not be applicable to the current fiscal year, except as to those acts required to be done during the current fiscal year in order to prepare and submit the proposed budget for the ensuing fiscal year, and except, that this act shall be in force as to section 8 hereof [§ 31-1608] and as to the remedies provided for in section 7 hereof [§ 31-1607].”

        This section was amended by two 1993 acts — ch. 327, § 14, and ch. 387, § 3, both effective July 1, 1993 — which do not appear to conflict and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 327, § 14, in the former third paragraph substituted “council” for “auditor”. However, ch. 387, § 3, deleted the former third paragraph of this section which read: “The board of county commissioners shall file one (1) copy of such completed audit report with the legislative auditor within ten (10) days after its delivery by the contracting auditor.” Therefore, the former third paragraph has been deleted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 387, § 3, at the end of the first paragraph deleted “by an independent auditor, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and procedures.”; deleted the former second and third paragraphs; and at the end of this section added “as required in section 67-450B, Idaho Code.”

At the time demand is made on the county auditor for said warrant it shall be the duty of the sheriff to file with the auditor a statement specifying the general purpose for which the sum to be withdrawn is to be used.

      The board of county commissioners of any county in this state may issue negotiable coupon bonds of their county for the purpose of paying, redeeming, funding or refunding the outstanding indebtedness of the county, including an obligation meeting the criteria of section 63-1315, Idaho Code, whether the indebtedness exists as a warrant indebtedness or bonded indebtedness. All such bonds shall be in the form and shall be issued, sold or exchanged and redeemed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 2, title 57, Idaho Code, known as the “municipal bond law” of the state of Idaho, except where different provision is made herein. Provided, that the authority to fund warrant indebtedness shall extend only to the funding of warrant indebtedness existing as of the second Monday in January, 1933, and providing further that all taxes and other revenues which but for the funding of warrants would have been lawfully applicable to the redemption of the warrants so funded shall, as and when collected, be apportioned to and placed in the sinking fund for the payment of the interest and retirement of the principal of such bonds. Bonds issued for the purpose of funding warrants shall bear interest payable semiannually as the board of county commissioners may determine.

      For the purpose of extending the time of payment of said outstanding indebtedness, or reducing the interest charged, or when the interests of the county require it, the board may issue said bonds in exchange for bonds, theretofore issued by the county or for valid and legal warrants of the county outstanding on the second Monday of January, 1933, and may do so by resolution of the board at a regular meeting thereof, and without a vote of the people. Before any bonds shall be issued or exchanged under this section, the board of county commissioners shall ascertain that the bonds or warrants the payment of which is to be extended, or which are to be taken in exchange for the new issue of bonds, are valid and legal obligations of the county, and their findings of fact shall be entered of record on the minutes of their proceedings at least ten (10) days before any exchange is made, as herein provided. The said board shall also, before issuing any bonds under this section, deduct from the total outstanding legal indebtedness of the county at the time of the issue of said bonds, the cash on hand in the treasury of the county, that is available for the payment of said legal indebtedness, or any part thereof, and the issue of bonds as in this section provided for, shall in no case exceed the aggregate or total legal indebtedness of the county then outstanding, less the cash on hand to be applied in payment and discharge of said indebtedness.

He must not place the same in the possession of any person to be used for any purpose; nor must he loan or in any manner use or permit any person to use the same, except as provided by law; but nothing in this section prohibits him from making special deposits for the safe-keeping of the public moneys.

        The statute does not enumerate the powers or place an exact limit on the authority which a police officer may lawfully exercise in the performance of his duties. In addition to the powers expressly conferred by statute, an officer has, by implication, such powers as are necessary for due and efficient exercise of those expressly granted or such as may be fairly implied therefrom, and, where a power is given by statute, everything lawful and necessary to the effectual execution of the power is given by implication of law.

        Sheriffs have the right and duty to determine what charge should be lodged against the accused. Cornell v. Harris, 60 Idaho 87, 88 P.2d 498 (1939).
    The duties enumerated are not exclusive to the sheriff, for the legislature by statutory provision has imposed authority and duty for peace officers, including policemen, to make arrests and otherwise enforce the criminal laws of the state. Monson v. Boyd, 81 Idaho 575, 348 P.2d 93 (1959).

Thus, the state showed at trial that the deputy had a legitimate basis for concern about defendant’s personal safety and the safety of approaching drivers; the deputy had the authority, and in fact the duty, to safeguard persons using the highways and the jury could have properly found that the deputy was performing a “duty” of his office when he ordered defendant to return to his own car and that by refusing to comply, defendant violated<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c07s18-705" target="_blank">§ 18-705</a></cite>.

        The writ of execution is a direct command or order of the court to the sheriff to carry out the mandate of the execution. Until the execution is lawfully withdrawn from his possession, or direction is given by an authorized person that the progress of the execution be suspended, the officer to whom it is directed has authority to execute and return the same and make any entry thereon which the law authorizes.

       <p>
        Process may have been procured through fraud or perjury, or a court which has ordered it may have committed the most serious errors or have exceeded its jurisdiction after once having exercised that jurisdiction, but if these facts do not appear on the face of process, if process is regular on its face and comes from a lawful authority, officer may execute it and legally justify his action.

        At the time of the enactment of this section, the assessor was ex officio tax collector. By Idaho Const., Art. VXIII, § 6, as amended, the county treasurer was made ex officio tax collector. S.L. 1913, ch. 128, § 1 made the county treasurer ex officio tax collector to conform to the constitutional provision as amended. It is presumed that this accounts for the inclusion of the 1913 act in the history line of this section by prior compilers.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No person shall be eligible to qualify for the office of prosecuting attorney who is not an attorney and counselor at law duly licensed to practice as such in the district courts of the state at the time he assumes office as prosecuting attorney. No prosecuting attorney shall hold any other county or state office during his term of office as prosecuting attorney provided, however, that a prosecuting attorney or a deputy prosecuting attorney may be appointed by the attorney general as a special assistant attorney general for the performance of duties pursuant to such appointment in any other county than the county in which such prosecutor or deputy prosecutor serves. Nothing in this section, as amended, shall be construed to authorize the appointment of a special assistant attorney general except upon the request in writing of the prosecuting attorney in the county in which such special assistant attorney general is to serve, nor shall this section authorize the appointment of a prosecuting attorney as special assistant attorney general without his consent.

        Authority to bind another prosecutor requires that the bargaining prosecutor have the authority to prosecute the charge being bargained away or otherwise affected; therefore, convictions for violating a no contact order in Kootenai County were vacated because defendant relied on the promise of a city prosecutor in Ada County when he entered into a plea agreement, that included a promise of not being prosecuted for additional charges. This plea agreement was binding on other prosecutors as agents of the state of Idaho. State v. Baker, 156 Idaho 209, 322 P.3d 291 (2014).

        When defendant agreed to plead guilty to harboring and protecting a felon, the state agreed to recommend probation with no prison time; after the district court sentenced defendant to five years in prison, the state violated the plea agreement at the hearing on defendant’s Idaho R.

        Where one of the defense attorneys became a civil deputy in the prosecutor’s office during the prosecution of defendants’ criminal cases, the trial court took adequate precautions to avoid any prejudice to the defendants by entering an order directing the attorney not to discuss any criminal proceedings in which he had participated or of which he had knowledge with any person while he was employed by the prosecutor’s office; ordering that the prosecutor issue and file with the trial court a written instruction directing the prosecutor’s staff not to discuss any pending criminal proceedings, including but not limited to this one, with the attorney; ordering the prosecutor to file statements with the court from each member of the prosecutor’s staff indicating receipt of this instruction; and ordering the prosecutor to file similar statements from the police and governmental agencies involved in the case.

        In a boundary dispute the trial court has to determine the location of the lines of the original plat as they are actually situated on the ground, or as located on the ground by the original survey of the plat. Nutterville v. McLam, 84 Idaho 36, 367 P.2d 576 (1961).

        Any evidence which throws light upon correctness of a survey is admissible. Humphrey v. Whitney, 17 Idaho 14, 103 P. 389 (1909).

       <p>
        Correct location of a corner may depend on whether it is a lost or an obliterated corner. Lost corner is one whose position cannot be determined beyond reasonable doubt, either from original marks or reliable marks or reliable external evidence. Obliterated corner is one where no visible evidence remains of the work of original surveyor in establishing it. Craven v. Lesh, 22 Idaho 463, 126 P. 774 (1912).

       <p>
        Where stone placed by government surveyor marking a quarter-section corner is not susceptible of location, boundary is determinable by selecting point equidistant between section corners. Case v. Ericson, 44 Idaho 686, 258 P. 536 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where government corner has been merely obliterated, but not lost, purpose of resurvey is to discover where original lines ran and not to correct any inaccuracies which might have occurred in original survey. White v. Garrett, 49 Idaho 136, 286 P. 362 (1930).

        Bureau of land management publications are not statutes and they may not be utilized to establish burdens of proof in real property disputes involving lost or obliterated corners. State ex rel. Evans v. Barnett, 116 Idaho 429, 776 P.2d 438 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where property owners asserted highway district was attempting to widen the highway onto their property, the injunction precluding the expansion was proper, because testimony and evidence from old survey records established that the common quarter corner between two sections was a lost corner, rather than an existent corner or an obliterated corner, and that a surveyor in 1956 failed to follow the requirements of the United States Manual of Surveying Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands of the United States in attempting to re-establish the corner. Henrickson v. Nampa Highway Dist., 139 Idaho 677, 85 P.3d 653 (2004).

     PREFATORY NOTE
    </h4>
    <p>
     The status of electronic information technology has progressed rapidly in recent years. Innovations in software, hardware, communications technology and security protocols have made it technically feasible to create, sign and transmit real estate transactions electronically.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, approaching the end of the 20th Century, various state and federal laws limited the enforceability of electronic documents. In response, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) was approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1999. As of October 1, 2004, UETA had been adopted in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign) was also adopted in 2000. The two acts give legal effect to real estate transactions that are executed electronically and allow them to be enforced between the parties to the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though documents resulting from electronic transactions are valid and enforceable between the parties, there is uncertainty and confusion about whether those electronic documents may be recorded in the various local land records offices in the several states. Legacy laws and regulations in many states purport to limit recordable documents to ones that are in writing or on paper or require that they be originals. Other laws and regulations require signatures to be in writing and acknowledgements to be signed. Being electronic and not written on paper, being an electronic version of an original paper document, or having an electronic signature and acknowledgement instead of handwritten ones, an electronic document might not be recordable under the laws of these states. The continuing application of these legacy laws and regulations remain uncertain (see Op. Cal. Atty. Gen. No. 02-112 (Sept. 4, 2002)).
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite these uncertainties, recorders in approximately 40 counties in several states began recording electronic documents. These efforts depend, however, on the initiatives of individual recorders and the opportunities available under the laws of those states. They are piecemeal and offer only limited interoperability among the recording venues and across state lines. They do not provide a uniform legal structure for the acceptance and processing of electronic documents.
    In response, a few states have convened study committees or task forces to consider the question of recording electronic documents (see Report of Iowa State Bar Ass’n, Real Estate Modernization Comm., draft of Ch. 558B — Iowa Electronic Recording Act (2001); Conn. Law Revision Comm., An Act Establishing the Connecticut Real Property Electronic Recording System (Conn. Gen Assembly, Judiciary Comm., Raised Bill No. 5664, 2004)). In 2002, a drafting committee was established by the NCCUSL Executive Committee to draft a Uniform Real Property Electronic Recording Act. The Committee’s decision followed a recommendation of the NCCUSL Committee on Scope and Program. Their actions were in recognition of a strong recommendation from the Joint Editorial Board on Uniform Real Property Acts that a uniform act be drafted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uniform Real Property Electronic Recording Act was drafted to remove any doubt about the authority of the recorder to receive and record documents and information in electronic form. Its fundamental principle is that any requirements of state law describing or requiring that a document be an original, on paper, or in writing are satisfied by a document in electronic form. Furthermore, any requirement that the document contain a signature or acknowledgment is satisfied by an electronic signature or acknowledgement. The act specifically authorizes a recorder, at the recorder’s option, to accept electronic documents for recording and to index and store those documents.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the recorder elects to accept electronic documents, the recorder must also comply with certain other requirements set forth in the act. In addition, the act charges an electronic recording commission or an existing state agency with the responsibility of implementing the act and adopting standards regarding the receipt, recording, and retrieval of electronic documents. The Commission or agency is directed to adopt those standards with a vision toward fostering intra- and interstate harmony and uniformity in electronic recording processes.
    </p>
    <p>
     This act does not state the means of funding the establishment or operation of an electronic recording system in the various recording venues. No single approach is inherently the best for funding electronic recording systems. This is especially true because of the range of taxation systems and cultures existing in the various states and recording venues and the diversity of the various states and recording venues in terms of population and resources. In fact, the best system for any state or recording venue might involve a combination of approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
     The establishment, and perhaps the operation, of an electronic recording system might be funded from the general taxes and revenues of the state or county. Because of the relatively large “front end” expenses needed to set up an electronic recording system, this approach might be very appropriate for that purpose. Whether the funding is to be by the county or the state is an issue that should be resolved prior to the passage of this act. A related question is whether the funding should cover the entire cost of setting up the system or only part of it with the remaining costs to be paid by recording and searching fees dedicated to the establishment of the electronic recording system.

        “Document.” A document consists of information stored on a medium, whether the medium be tangible or electronic, provided that the information is retrievable in a perceivable form. The traditional tangible medium has been paper on which information is inscribed by writing, typing, printing or similar means. It is perceivable by reading it directly from the paper on which it is inscribed. An electronic medium may be one on which information is stored magnetically and from which it may be retrieved and read indirectly on a computer monitor or a paper printout.

        “Electronic.” The term “electronic” refers to the use of electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic and similar technologies. It is a descriptive term meant to include all technologies involving electronic processes. The listing of specific technologies is not intended to be a limiting one. For example, biometric identification technologies would be included if they affect communication and storage of information by electronic means. As electronic technologies expand and include other competencies, those competencies should also be included under this definition.

        “Electronic document.” An “electronic document” is a “document” that is in an “electronic” form. Both of these terms are previously defined. However, this definition adds an additional requirement not specifically stated in the individual definitions. In order to be an “electronic document” the document must be received by the recorder in an “electronic” form. The character of a document as “electronic” or “paper” will be determined at the moment it is received by the recorder.

       <li id="t31c29s31-2902-officialcommentol14">
        “Electronic signature.” The term “electronic signature” is based on the definition of that term in UETA § 2(8). However, this definition uses the word “document” instead of “record” to identify the instrument being signed. (See generally paragraph 1, above, for a discussion of the reasons).

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       While a document recorded in a land records office will usually contain information affecting real property, it need not necessarily be so limited. It applies to any document that is recorded in the land records office maintained by the recorder. Deeds, grants of easements, and mortgages are documents subject to this act. Similarly, certificates and affidavits not directly affecting real property may be documents under this act if state law provides these documents are to be recorded in the land records office.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of a document in this act is derived from the definition of the term “record” as contained in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) § 2(13). In the terms of that act, a document is a record that is eligible to be recorded in the land records maintained by the recorder. In selecting the defined term “document” for use throughout this act, an explicit decision was made not to use “record” as a defined term. The term “record” has a different meaning in real estate recording law and practice than it has in UETA. If the term “record” were used generally in this act, it might lead to confusion and misinterpretation.
    In UETA, the term “record” refers to information on a tangible or electronic medium as does the term “document” in this act. In this act, however, depending on syntax, the term “record” and its variations can have several meanings, all of which deal with document storage and not the information itself. For example, this act deals with the recording process through which a person can record a document. The government officer who oversees the land records office is the recorder. These terms are so ingrained in the lexicon of real estate recording law and practice that it would not be productive to attempt to change them by this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of the term “electronic” in this act has the same meaning as it has in UETA § 2(5).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a document may have an existence in an “electronic” form prior or subsequent to being received by the recorder it might not be an “electronic document” under this act. For example, the document may have been created by an electronic process or have existed in an electronic form before being converted to, and received by the recorder in, a paper form. Thus, a document prepared on a computer by means of a word processing program may have been created electronically and may still exist electronically. If, however, the document is printed and submitted to the recorder on paper, the submitted document is not an electronic document. Similarly, after arriving in the recorder’s office in a paper form, the document may be converted to an electronic form prior to, or as part of, the recording process. The paper document does not become an electronic document because of the post-receipt conversion. (For a definition of the term “paper document,” see § 4(a) [§ 31-2904(1)].)
      </p>
      <p>
       By comparison, a document received by the recorder in an electronic form, but subsequently converted to a paper form, will be considered to be an electronic document. For example, if a document is received electronically and then printed in a paper form in the recorder’s office prior to storage, it is, nonetheless, an electronic document. Thus, a document received by the process commonly known as a facsimile or a FAX, is an electronic document. Issues common to electronic documents, such as security and integrity, also relate to a facsimile or FAX document.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many cases a document may have originally been executed in a paper form with “wet signatures” and subsequently imaged and converted into an electronic format. This act provides that, if such a converted document is received by the recorder in an electronic format, it will be considered to be an electronic document and may be recorded. (See § 3(a) [§ 31-2903(1)].)
      </p>
      <p>
       This act does not state or limit the type of electronic documents that may be accepted by the recorder. Nor does it state the type of electronic signatures that are permissible. Those matters are subject to the standards adopted by the state electronic recording commission or state agency pursuant to § 5 [former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t31c29s31-2905" target="_self">§ 31-2905</a></cite>].
    This act applies only to documents that are received by the recorder in an electronic form and enables those documents to be recorded. The recordability of documents not received by the recorder in an electronic form continues to depend on other state law.

        Subsection (a)[(1)] states the basic principle of this act — if a document would be recordable in a paper format, an electronic document with the same content and meeting the requirements of this act is also recordable. Any reference in a statute, regulation, or standard to a document as being on paper or a similar tangible medium in order to be recorded is superseded by this act. Similarly any statute, regulation, or standard that specifies that a document must be in writing in order to be recorded is also overruled by this act. Furthermore, since any paper-specific requirement such as the size of the paper or the color of the ink used for the document is inapplicable to an electronic document, those requirements do not prohibit or limit the recording of electronic documents.
       </li>
       <li id="t31c29s31-2903ol1b">
        Subsection (b)[(2)] provides that any statute, regulation, or standard requiring that a document be signed in order to be recorded is satisfied by an electronic signature attached to an electronic document. The provisions of UETA and the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign) [15 U.S.C.S. § 7001 et seq.] provide that an electronic signature is not an impediment to the enforceability of an electronic document between the parties to the transaction. Similarly, this section provides that an electronic signature is not an impediment to the recording of the document.
    (c) This section provides that any statute, regulation, or standard requiring that a notarization, acknowledgement, verification, witnessing, or taking of an oath be done on paper or similar tangible medium, that it be done in writing, or that it be signed, is satisfied by an electronic signature that is attached to, or logically associated with, the electronic document. It permits a notary public or other authorized person to act electronically without the need to do so on paper.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This subsection also provides that any stipulation of state law requiring that a document be an original document is satisfied by an electronic document meeting the requirements of this act. For example, this section acknowledges that one form of electronic document is created by making an electronic duplicate of an original paper document. The duplicate is an electronic “picture” of the original document with all of its signatures and verifications. Under some existing state laws, the electronic duplicate may be considered to be a copy of the original paper document and not the original itself. The laws of the state may also provide that a copy of a document may not be recorded. This act corrects that circumstance and allows the electronic document containing the “picture” of the original document to be recorded. Of course, in order to be valid, the original paper document must be executed in accordance with law, including a signature and verification.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also provides that any statute, regulation, or standard that requires a personal or corporate stamp, impression, or seal is satisfied by an electronic signature. These physical indicia are inapplicable to a fully electronic document. Thus, the notarial stamp or impression that is required under the laws of some states is not required for an electronic notarization under this act. Nor is there a need for a corporate stamp or impression as would otherwise be required under the laws of some states to verify the action of a corporate officer. Nevertheless, this act requires that the information that would otherwise be contained in the stamp, impression, or seal must be attached to, or logically associated with, the document or signature in an electronic fashion.

         A “paper document” is one that is received by the recorder in a form that is not “electronic.” Despite the use of the word “paper,” this document form is not limited to documents on a paper medium; the use of the word “paper” is merely a convenience. It applies to any non-electronic document that the recorder is authorized to accept.
        </li>
        <li id="t31c29s31-2904-STATUTORYNOTESol1b">
         Subsection (b) [(2)] sets forth specific required or elective functions that apply to the recording of documents.
    (1) With the exception of paragraphs (1) [(a)] and (4) [(d)], implementation of any functions described in subsection (b) [(2)] is optional and a decision to implement one or more of them is to be made by the recorder. The act does not require that a recorder implement any or all of those functions. It merely allows each recorder to implement them when and if the recorder decides to proceed with electronic recording.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Just as with the definition of an “electronic document” in section 2 [§ 31-2902] of this act, the moment at which the character of the document will be determined is the moment it is received by the recorder. If a document is received by the recorder in a non-electronic form, it is a “paper” document regardless of whether it has a prior or subsequent existence as an electronic document.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, under paragraph (1) [(a)] if a recorder does elect to implement any of the functions described in this section, the recorder must do so in accordance with the standards established by the electronic recording commission or the state agency. All aspects of the functions described in this subsection are subject to the standards of the Commission or agency.
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) Paragraph (2) [(b)] provides that the recorder may choose to implement electronic recording functions. Recording functions are varied and deal with obtaining and storing of documents in a recording system. Under this paragraph, the recorder may elect to receive electronic documents. The recorder may store those electronic documents, or the information contained in them, and create an index of the documents or information. The recorder may also transmit electronic documents and communications to the recording party or to other parties. Finally, the recorder may archive the electronic documents or the information in them as well as the index in order to preserve and protect them. This is an election to be made by the recorder that is separate from the decision to provide electronic searching, as described in paragraph (3) [(c)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this act also applies to “Torrens” title registration systems, a recorder who operates a title registration system may choose to implement the functions of receiving, indexing, storing, archiving, and transmitting electronic documents for the title registration system.
       </p>
       <p>
        (3) Paragraph (3) [(c)] provides that the recorder may choose to implement electronic search and retrieval functions. Searching and retrieval functions include any process by which a title searcher obtains information from the land records system. The paragraph allows a recorder to authorize persons to access documents or their information, including index information, electronically. In so doing, the recorder may allow the accessing party to search the index and the stored documents or information electronically and to retrieve them in an electronic format. This is an election to be made by the recorder that is separate from the decision to record electronic documents, as described in paragraph (2) [(b)]. A recorder who operates a “Torrens” title registration system also may choose to implement the functions of accessing, searching, and retrieving documents or information in the title registration system.
       </p>
       <p>
        (4) This act does not require that persons engaging in real estate transactions use electronic documents in order to have their documents recorded. It merely permits the recorder to accept electronic documents if they are presented electronically. Economics, availability of technology, and human nature suggest that not everyone will begin to use electronic real estate documents immediately. It will likely be some time before the use of electronic documents becomes dominant and perhaps well beyond that before paper documents disappear altogether from the conveyancing process. In recognition of that fact, paragraph (4) [(d)] requires the recorder to continue to accept paper documents even after establishing an electronic recording system. This is a mandatory and not an elective provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        This paragraph also provides that the recorder must index the paper documents together with electronic documents as part of a single indexing system. This will enable a title examiner to make a single search of one index for the purpose of ascertaining all relevant instruments that were recorded after the initiation of electronic recording. It avoids the inefficient and costly process of maintaining and searching two separate indexing systems — one for electronic documents and one for paper documents.
    Efficiency also suggests that the unified index would be an electronic one. It would be more efficient to store the index information from paper documents in an electronic index than to convert and store the index information from electronic documents in a paper index system. Electronic index information can be sorted and managed more easily and efficiently than paper index information. In addition, an electronic index can be searched more quickly and without the searcher’s physical presence in the recorder’s office. However, the act does not require the index chosen by the recorder to be an electronic one.
       </p>
       <p>
        (5) Paragraphs (5) [(e)] and (6) [(f)] relate to the conversion and storage of the text or information contained in paper documents in an electronic form. It does not concern the index information that is derived from those paper documents. The treatment of index information is described in the paragraph (4) [(d)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (5) [(e)] relates to the conversion of “new” paper documents received by the recorder after the implementation of an electronic recording system. It does not require that such newly-received paper documents be converted and stored in an electronic form. It does, however, permit the recorder to make a conversion of those paper documents into an electronic form and store them with electronic documents received by the recorder. If the paper documents are not converted into an electronic form, the recorder must continue to store them and, as public documents, the recorder must continue to provide a process for accessing them.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the recorder does not convert “new” paper documents into an electronic form, the usefulness and efficiency of the electronic recording system may be limited. A title examiner will have to obtain physical access to the paper document information in traditional ways. Since electronic documents are stored electronically, the examiner will have to access two different storage systems — one for paper documents and one for electronic documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        (6) Paragraph (6) [(f)] relates to the conversion of information from “old” paper documents recorded prior to the implementation of an electronic recording system. As with newly-received paper documents, the act does not require the recorder to convert previously-recorded information into an electronic form. Such a conversion is, however, permitted under the act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dealing with “old” document information is more challenging than dealing with “new” documents simply because of the potentially large expenditure of time and money needed to convert a significant volume of paper information extending over many past years into an electronic form. The time period over which a fully-effective conversion would extend probably spans a period of forty to sixty or more years, depending on the customary period of search in the jurisdiction. Without the conversion, the usefulness and efficiency of the electronic recording system is limited, at least until the passage of a period after the adoption of the act that is equal to the customary period of search.
       </p>
       <p>
        (7) Paragraph (7) [(g)] provides that any fee or tax that is collected by the recorder may be collected through an electronic payment system. Without a means of paying the applicable fees and taxes electronically, the achievement of a speedy and efficient electronic recording system would not be possible. Although the document could be submitted electronically, the fee would have to be paid by traditional means. The effective completion of the recording would be delayed until that payment is received by the recorder.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nature and operation of the electronic payment system is not specified. The selection is subject to standards set by the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency and the choice of the recorder. Among others, the alternatives might include a subscription service with a regular billing system, a prepayment system with recording and access charges applied against a deposited amount, or a payment per individual service system.
    (8) Commonly, before a recorder may accept a document for recording it must be approved by one or more other offices in order to assure compliance with the other office’s requirements. The person submitting the document may also be required to pay fees or taxes to the other office or offices. If the prior approval and the fee or tax paying processes are not conjoined with the electronic recording process, it will not be possible to effectuate the speedy electronic recording envisioned by this act.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, a document may first need to be submitted to the county assessor or treasurer to determine whether prior real estate taxes have been paid or whether current ones are due. Under current practice that submission and approval might have to be accomplished in a physical process independent of the electronic recording process. If a tax or fee is due, that sum might also have to be paid by check or other non-electronic process to the treasurer. Procedures such as these will delay the electronic recording process and will limit the achievement of a speedy, efficient electronic recording system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (8) [(h)] permits and encourages the recorder to enter into agreements with other county and state offices for the purpose of implementing processes that will allow the simultaneous satisfaction of all conditions precedent to recording and the payment of all fees and taxes in a single transaction. Any fees and taxes paid by the recording party will be allocated among the recorder and the other offices in accordance with their agreements.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The salaries of county officers as full compensation for their services must be paid monthly from the county treasury, upon the warrants of the county auditor, and it shall not be necessary for the board of commissioners to allow or audit the claims for such salaries when the salaries of such officers are fixed by law or have been fixed or approved by action of the board of commissioners. All actual and necessary expenses incurred by any county officer or deputy in the performance of his official duty shall be a legal charge against the county, and shall be certified by receipts to the county auditor. The county auditor shall then issue a county warrant in the amount so certified, payable to the officer or deputy submitting the certification, and the warrant paid shall be charged against said officer’s budget. When any such officer or deputy shall use his private car as a means of travel in the performance of his official duty the actual and necessary expense of the use of such car shall be determined by the county commissioners of each county and allowance made therefor at a rate for each mile driven shall be applied uniformly to each officer or deputy in that county and such allowance shall be the full amount allowable for travel expense when such car is used. All fees which may come into his hands from whatever source shall be turned into the county treasury daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly as determined by the county commissioners. He shall, at least quarterly, file with the clerk of the board of county commissioners, a sworn statement, accompanied by proper vouchers, showing all fees received, which must be audited by the board as other accounts.

        Fees “received” by officer for which he must account to county include fees earned, though not collected, by officer. Naylor v. Vermont Loan & Trust Co., 6 Idaho 251, 55 P. 297 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fees received by county treasurer in acting as ex officio public administrator must be accounted for and reported to county and cannot be retained by officer for his personal or individual use. In re Rice, 12 Idaho 305, 85 P. 1109 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems clear that the fees referred to in this section are only those which come into the officer’s hands as fees, and not money paid him by some other officer, though the money may have been received by the latter as fees.

        Bill of county officers for expenses incurred in his official capacity while on official business can be considered by commissioners as part of the officer’s quarterly statement only and cannot be made an independent claim or account. Clyne v. Bingham County, 7 Idaho 75, 60 P. 76 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge made by county officer for living expenses is not an expense incurred in performance of official duty such as to be payable by county. Clyne v. Bingham County, 7 Idaho 75, 60 P. 76 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        It should fully appear from the officer’s quarterly statement in what manner and for what reasons expenses presented in such statement were incurred. The statement should be sworn to and be accompanied by proper vouchers proving disbursements. Claim of an officer presented in the following form: “August 13, State v. Dan Hopkins, hotel and horse fee, $ 15.50,” is a “lump sum” and should not be considered. Clyne v. Bingham County, 7 Idaho 75, 60 P. 76 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Account of officer against county presented in the following form: “Mileage, eight miles, serving subpoenas, $2.80,” is too indefinite to answer the requirements of law. Ellis v. Bingham County, 7 Idaho 86, 60 P. 79 (1900).

       <p>
        Account of officer against county for expense presented in the following form: “State of Idaho v. James Southwick, et al., serving nine warrants of arrest, $18,” is vague and indefinite.

       <p>
        The failure of county to compel preference of legal deposit of fees by sheriff in insolvent bank did not relieve liability of sheriff to surety for money paid county, when sheriff failed to assert preference on filing claim with receiver of bank.

        County commissioners have power to authorize appointment of deputies and employees for other county offices, to set salaries for these deputies and employees, and to insure that their work schedules are in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. To the extent the commissioners determine that a countywide personnel system is the most efficient and professional way to carry out these responsibilities, commissioners would have power to create such a system and to hire employees to staff it; however, the commissioners could not use such a system to control the other county officers or to judge their job performance.<cite class="OAG">OAG 86-10</cite>.

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 1982, ch. 353 read: “By the enactment of Chapter 223, Laws of 1981, the state made a dramatic move to reduce congestion in the court system, to improve the ability of peace officers to regulate and control motor vehicle traffic, and to achieve significant economies in the administration of justice. This chapter has not yet gone into effect, since it was deliberately enacted with an effective date clause of July 1, 1982. This was done to allow those officials concerned with the administration and enforcement of the law to have time to review and study its provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It has now come to our attention that some adjustments to Chapter 223 are in order, and that other equally vital changes need to be made in other sections of the law. It is the intent of this bill to provide a means to accomplish this. This bill repeals outright several sections of Chapter 223, in order that the Idaho Code provisions amended by such sections might be left in place; this bill repeals several sections of existing Idaho Code provisions; this bill replaces some of these repealed sections; and this bill adds new sections and makes several amendments in order to make the entire concept a viable instrument. And finally, this bill would delay the effective date of Chapter 223 from July 1, 1982 to March 1, 1983, so that all of the needed changes, revisions and amendments can function as an integrated whole.”
       </p>
       <p>
        However, S.L. 1983, Chapter 2 provided that the 1981 and 1982 amendments of this section should become effective July 1, 1983.

      Each person admitted into a drug court or mental health court shall pay a drug court and mental health court fee in an amount not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300) per month or a lesser amount as set by the administrative district judge for participants in the drug court and mental health court.

Any failure to pay the drug court and mental health court fee may constitute grounds for termination from drug court or mental health court by the court, provided this shall not be the exclusive remedy for collection of the fee. If a participant is terminated from the drug court or mental health court prior to successful completion of the program and a judgment of conviction is entered against the defendant, any unpaid drug court and mental health court fee shall be ordered by the court in the judgment of conviction, provided the court may order such fee to be waived if the court determines that the person is indigent and unable to pay the fee.

        It is the responsibility of the sheriff and an expense to his or her county to transport an inmate from the prison back to the county where the inmate’s attendance in court is required; however, in the case of female prisoners, clear statutory language places the responsibility upon the state board of corrections.<cite class="OAG">OAG 83-11</cite>.

     <p>
      The court shall charge a fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) for victim notification purposes to be paid by each person found guilty of each felony, misdemeanor or infraction under section 18-8001 or 49-301, Idaho Code, or first-time infraction under section 23-604 or 23-949, Idaho Code, except when the court orders such fee waived because the person is indigent and unable to pay such fee. Such fee shall be in addition to all other fines and fees levied. Such fee shall be paid to the county treasurer who shall, within five (5) days after the end of the month, pay such fees to the state treasurer for deposit in the state victim notification fund established in section 67-2912, Idaho Code.

       <p>
        Where county recorder has recorded papers and written instruments and has not collected the full amount of fees prescribed by the statute therefor, and has thereafter rendered his accounts and settled with board of county commissioners without accounting for the uncollected portion of such fees, county has such an interest in the unpaid fees as to enable it to prosecute an action directly against party for whom work was done and to recover the same. Lincoln County v. Twin Falls N. Side Land & Water Co., 23 Idaho 433, 130 P. 788 (1913).
    If recorder, in making a reduction of fees in favor of a person, acts under instructions of board of county commissioners, county is estopped to recover the uncharged balance from him and his bondsmen. Twin Falls County v. West, 25 Idaho 271, 137 P. 171 (1913).

        Changing Fees.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fees prescribed by statute to be charged by county recorder are arbitrary charges fixed by act of legislature, and no officer has any right to change the same or depart from the terms thereof as prescribed by legislature. Fact that recorder has a blank book containing printed forms which may reduce cost of recording does not justify him in making any less or different rate than that prescribed by statute. Lincoln County v. Twin Falls N. Side Land & Water Co., 23 Idaho 433, 130 P. 788 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Board of county commissioners has no power or authority to change the fee and to direct and require recorder to record such instruments at a less or different rate than that prescribed by statute. Twin Falls County v. West, 25 Idaho 271, 137 P. 171 (1913).

        This section does not allow a recorder passively to hold a document for “pick up,” and although mailing is an economic burden to the recorder, he is entitled to collect $3.00 per recorded page as a recording fee and this charge covers the cost of delivery.

        Where district court treated magistrate’s finding on prescription medication issue as a “certification” that the entire “action” was frivolous, where the district court then relied upon this purported “certification” without making an independent determination of its own, and where the district court made no determination as to whether the appeal presented material factual issues for which review of a transcript or of a tape would be necessary, the court, in dismissing the appeal, exercised its discretion inconsistently with applicable legal standards.

        The trial court did not err in holding that the plaintiffs were not “indigent” so as to qualify for the waiver of costs and fees where the evidence indicated that the plaintiffs had a net after tax monthly income of $1,334, that the plaintiffs donated ten percent of their income to a church, and that the plaintiffs made no claims that they could not borrow the funds.

        In an action in the district court to recover damages for mental anguish and physical suffering allegedly caused by an abusive and threatening telephone call made to the plaintiff by an employee of the department of health and welfare, the allegation of maliciousness should have been explicitly taken into account by the district court in reaching its conclusion regarding the extent to which compliance with the tort claims act was necessary, and, ultimately, therefore, whether the appeal from the dismissal order was frivolous. Because of this flaw in the discretionary decision of the district court, under subsection (2) of this section, refusing to waive appellate fees and costs on the ground the appellate action was frivolous, the court of appeals vacated the order and remanded the question as to the waiver of costs and fees to the district court for further consideration and determination.

Consequently, costs and fees awarded under subsection (16) are not dischargeable debts in bankruptcy. Ada County Prosecuting Atty’s. Office v. Searcy (In re Searcy), 448 B.R. 19 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2011), aff’d, 463 B.R. 888 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2012).

        Where the court did not make any finding on a prisoner’s indigency in relation to the non-payment of filing fees, did not consider the alternative of allowing him to proceed on payment of only part of the applicable fees, did not issue an order specifying the amount of fees that the prisoner would be required to pay, and did not allow him thirty days within which to pay, the dismissal of his appeal could not be sustained.

       The clerk of the district court may accept payment of a debt owed to the court by a credit card or debit card. Any person making payment on a debt owed to the court by a credit card or debit card shall be assessed an electronic payment convenience fee established by the supreme court, which shall include, among other costs, the amount charged the court by the issuer for the use of the card. This fee may also be paid by credit card or debit card and included in the transaction for the payment of the debt owed to the court. The electronic payment convenience fee shall be separate from the debt owed to the court and shall be deposited into the court technology fund created in section 1-1623, Idaho Code, and shall be used for the implementation of the provisions of this section. The debt owed to the court shall not be expunged, canceled, released, discharged or satisfied and any receipt or other evidence of payment shall be deemed conditional until the court has received final and unconditional payment of the full amount due from the financing agency or card issuer for the transaction. If an electronic payment once made is subsequently denied, revoked or otherwise canceled for any reason, and the payment is withdrawn from the court, the court may proceed as though payment had never been made.

Boards of county commissioners, by resolution, shall promulgate policies and procedures, may negotiate payment to providers, and may contract for nonmedical services, pursuant to this chapter. For the purpose of funding nonmedical services for indigent persons, boards of county commissioners are authorized to levy an ad valorem tax pursuant to section 31-3503, Idaho Code.

        County board of commissioners erroneously denied medical indigency benefits to a migrant farm worker for a second biopsy, even though there was a month delay between first and second biopsy. Such a delay did not indicate an absence of a medical emergency; the evidence clearly demonstrated that the worker took steps to diagnose her condition in a prompt manner rather than delaying treatment and risking her life by postponing the second biopsy until it was economically feasible for her family to return to their home in Texas. There existed, at the time of her treatment, an imperative need to confirm whether she would require immediate emergency care. Salinas v. Canyon County, 117 Idaho 218, 786 P.2d 611 (Ct. App. 1990).

        Section 8 of S.L. 1990, ch. 87 amended this section effective October 1, 1991; however, S.L. 1990, ch. 87 was repealed by § 1 of S.L. 1991, ch. 233 and § 19(1) of said ch. 233 declared an emergency and provided that such repeal should take effect upon passage and approval. Chapter 233 of S.L. 1991 became law without the governor’s signature on April 13,1991. Therefore, the amendment by S.L. 1990, ch. 87 never took effect.

VIII, § 4 and Idaho Const., Art. XII, § 4, because those constitutional provisions were adopted only to prevent private interests from gaining advantage at the expense of the taxpayer and were not intended to prohibit counties from giving aid to indigents; since the funds remain within the effective control of the municipality, it is apparent that the evils sought to be prevented by those constitutional provisions do not exist.

        Because the legislature amended the Idaho administrative procedures act in 1992, removing the language allowing modification of an agency decision, the district court correctly determined that it lacked statutory authority under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c52s67-5279" target="_blank">§ 67-5279 </a></cite>to enter a money judgment against the county on hospital’s claim for reimbursement for indigent’s treatment; hospital could have sought other possible remedies through the contempt powers of the district court.

        Section 9 of S.L. 1990, ch. 87 amended this section effective October 1, 1991; however, S.L. 1990, ch. 87 was repealed by § 1 of S.L. 1991, ch. 233 and § 19(1) of said ch. 233 declared an emergency and provided that such repeal should take effect upon passage and approval. Chapter 233 of S.L. 1991 became law without the governor’s signature on April 13, 1991. Therefore, the amendment of this section by S.L. 1990, ch. 87 never took effect.

        Available Defined.
       </h5>
       <p>
        “Available” in subdivision (1) [now (17))] of this section denotes currently or immediately obtainable income or resources and a corresponding present ability to pay rather than a future ability to pay or a potential future ability to pay. University of Utah Hosp. & Medical Ctr. v. Twin Falls County, 122 Idaho 1010, 842 P.2d 689 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of “available” does not necessarily mean the present ability to pay all medical expenses immediately, but rather present ability to pay the medical expenses incurred within a reasonable time. Jefferson County v. Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Ctr., 127 Idaho 495, 903 P.2d 84 (1995).
       </p>

       <h5 id="t31c35s31-3502-CASENOTES-availableresources">
        Available Resources.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In determining whether an applicant for medical assistance is medically indigent, only those resources actually available to an applicant can be considered in determining his eligibility. Assets which cannot be turned into cash, i.e., which are not liquid, must be excluded in determining the extent of an applicant’s resources. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 107 Idaho 248, 688 P.2d 260 (Ct. App. 1984), rev’d on other grounds, 109 Idaho 299, 707 P.2d 410 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a resource to be “available” and considered with respect to medically indigent status, it must have a net positive value and be liquid; this is a question of fact. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 299, 707 P.2d 410 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        If state or federal law does not prohibit creditors from reaching a given resource (including income) of a medical debtor, and the resource’s fair market value (exclusive of liabilities) exceeds its liabilities, and the debtor can readily convert the resource into cash, then the resource is “available” under subdivision (1) [now (17)] of this section for the purpose of determining medical indigency. Idaho Falls Consol. Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 881, 712 P.2d 582 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the resources of a medically indigent person any assets which are exempt from attachment or levy cannot be considered as resources available. University of Utah Hosp. ex rel. Scarberry v. Board of County Comm’rs, 116 Idaho 434, 776 P.2d 443 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the resources of a medically indigent person, a resource must have a positive value greater than its liabilities, encumbrances, and indebtedness and must be liquid and readily convertible into cash. University of Utah Hosp. ex rel. Scarberry v. Board of County Comm’rs, 116 Idaho 434, 776 P.2d 443 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was proper to defer to the commissioners on whether defendant’s assets were liquid because the question of whether a resource was liquid was a question of fact and was, therefore, for the board of county commissioners, and not for the appellate courts to decide and commissioners’ finding was supported by substantial evidence. Jefferson County v. Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Ctr., 127 Idaho 495, 903 P.2d 84 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an applicant’s minimal income could not retire his debt within three years, regardless of what “lifestyle choices” he might make, and where the prior unrealized opportunity to purchase insurance did not constitute an available resource, the county commission’s decision to deny the applicant medical indigency benefits was arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. Bonner Gen. Hosp. v. Bonner County, 133 Idaho 7, 981 P.2d 242 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Patient was not eligible for medical indigency benefits where he had discretionary income which was enough to pay for services, regardless of the fact that he had other outstanding debts with the same hospital. Sacred Heart Med. Ctr. v. Kootenai County Comm’rs, 136 Idaho 787, 41 P.3d 215 (2001).
    A patient was not medically indigent and the hospital was not entitled to reimbursement from the county on the patient’s behalf where the patient was voluntarily unemployed outside the home. Imputing income to the patient as a “resource” as that term is defined or in imputing future tax refunds as a resource was proper. St. Luke’s Magic Valley Reg’l Med. Ctr., Ltd v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 149 Idaho 584, 237 P.3d 1210 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The district court erred in affirming county’s consideration of the equity in patient’s home below the homestead exemption and patient’s social security and railroad retirement benefits as “resources available” in making a determination on the issue of medical indigency, as these resources were exempt from levy or similar legal process. Idaho Falls Consol. Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 881, 712 P.2d 582 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Patient’s failure to file a declaration of homestead did not leave homestead vulnerable to attachment, and it was not a “resource available” under this section; the patient could invoke the protection of the homestead exemption by filing a declaration of homestead prior to the attachment of any lien on her home. Idaho Falls Consol. Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 881, 712 P.2d 582 (1985).

        Completed Application.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Determination of a “completed application” depends on the identity of the party submitting the application and the knowledge and ability of that party to respond to the inquiries and requests in the application. It is not contemplated that both the applicant/patient and third party applicant will sign the application. Therefore, it was improper to deny a medical center’s third party application as incomplete where it did not contain the signatures of the patients. St. Alphonsus Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Elmore Cnty. (In re T.A.), 158 Idaho 648, 350 P.3d 1025 (2015).

       <p>
        Although the board made a factual determination that the applicants were “sick persons,” this did not alter or modify the level of responsibility placed on the counties by the legislature. This is a discretionary form of public assistance which the county has opted not to assume. The supreme court will not impose such an obligation without a statutory mandate from the legislature. Shobe v. Ada County, 130 Idaho 580, 944 P.2d 715 (1997).

       <p>
        This section does not require that an applicant have no assets; it requires only that his medical expenses exceed his available resources. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 107 Idaho 248, 688 P.2d 260 (Ct. App. 1984), rev’d on other grounds, 109 Idaho 299, 707 P.2d 410 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature did not intend that a person be completely destitute or devoid of all resources in order to be considered medically indigent, but only that the person be unable to pay for necessary medical services. Carpenter v. Twin Falls County, 107 Idaho 575, 691 P.2d 1190 (1984), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in IHC Hospitals, Inc. v. Teton County, 139 Idaho 188, 75 P.3d 1198 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a review of the record clearly demonstrated that claimant did not have income and resources available which would enable him to pay for the emergency medical services provided for his wife, the district court did not err in finding there was no basis in fact for the commissioners’ decision to deny claimant’s application for benefits on the basis that he was not a medically indigent person. Carpenter v. Twin Falls County, 107 Idaho 575, 691 P.2d 1190 (1984), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in IHC Hospitals, Inc. v. Teton County, 139 Idaho 188, 75 P.3d 1198 (2003).
    This section does not state or imply that the parents or guardians stand in the place of the child, or that the child, whether or not he or she has resources, is considered not to exist for the purpose of determining medical indigency. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 412, 707 P.2d 1051 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the balance due hospital exceeded the “resources available” to patient, which included two vehicles and checking and savings accounts, the patient was medically indigent as a matter of law. Idaho Falls Consol. Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 881, 712 P.2d 582 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish indigency, an applicant need not be completely destitute or devoid of all resources; all that is required is a showing that the person is unable to pay for necessary medical services. Salinas v. Canyon County, 117 Idaho 218, 786 P.2d 611 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Idaho’s medical indigency statutes, the applicant bears the burden of proving medical indigency. However, this duty is not absolute. The clerk of the board of county commissioners has a reciprocal duty to make reasonable inquiry into the grounds for the application. Salinas v. Canyon County, 117 Idaho 218, 786 P.2d 611 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The commissioner’s decision that defendant was not medically indigent because he had ample resources to pay for his medical expenses but for his voluntary abuse of credit cards, which were non-judicial obligations having no priority over the medical expenses incurred, was supported by substantial and competent evidence. Jefferson County v. Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Ctr., 127 Idaho 495, 903 P.2d 84 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy behind providing medical indigency benefits is to assist people who are “truly needy” with medical expenses, not necessarily to assist people who have the financial ability to pay were it not for their voluntary abuse of credit cards or the lifestyle choices they made. Jefferson County v. Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Ctr., 127 Idaho 495, 903 P.2d 84 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a pending medicaid application is not considered an available resource in determining qualification for medical indigency, hospital could not claim the patient became medically indigent after her admission when her medicaid application was denied; thus,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t31c35s31-3504" target="_self">§ 31-3504 </a></cite>did not apply and extend the filing deadline for hospital’s medical indigency application. University of Utah Hosp. v. Board of Comm’rs, 128 Idaho 529, 915 P.2d 1387 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of an application of medical indigency benefits on the ground that an applicant was an undocumented alien and, therefore, not a resident of the county was remanded to the county board of commissioners, because the board failed to make findings on critical factors of eligibility, including indigency and medical necessity. Mercy Med. Ctr. v. Ada County, 146 Idaho 226, 192 P.3d 1050 (2008).

        Nothing in the definitions of “medically indigent” or “resources” allows for the consideration of resources available to a regional hospital, or third party applicant, such as federal payments under the Hill-Burton Act (42 U.S.C.S. § 291 et seq.), when determining whether a person is medically indigent. St. Luke’s Magic Valley Reg’l Med. Ctr., Ltd v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 150 Idaho 484, 248 P.3d 735 (2011).

        The board of county commissioners’ conclusion that the services were not necessary medical services was overturned, where it was unsupported by substantial, competent evidence and was clearly erroneous.

        Medical center did not provide emergency services to the patient since immediate medical care was not rendered; none of the medical reports submitted to the county indicated that surgery on the patient was performed on an emergency basis, and as such, because the center’s application for reimbursement was untimely for non-emergency services, the county properly denied the application.

        A hospital’s uncompensated services obligation under the federal Hill-Burton Act (42 U.S.C.S. § 291 et seq.), was not a resource available under this section which would preclude applicants from obtaining county medical assistance if they were otherwise qualified to receive it. Braun v. Ada County, 102 Idaho 901, 643 P.2d 1071 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the board first denied the application for medical indigency benefits, the pending worker’s compensation claim suggested that there might be other available resources which would pay the medical expenses; so plaintiff did not become medically indigent until the industrial commission denied his claim and it was actually determined that the worker’s compensation benefits were not available as a source of payment. St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Ctr., Ltd. v. Canyon County, 120 Idaho 420, 816 P.2d 977 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assets which consisted of applicant’s equity in a house and two automobiles were “other resources available” as provided for in this section. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The possibility of future benefits from other governmental agencies did not constitute an available resource relieving a county of its obligation to pay a medical indigency claim until such time that a final decision on eligibility for those benefits was rendered. University of Utah Hosp. & Medical Ctr. v. Twin Falls County, 122 Idaho 1010, 842 P.2d 689 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only those resources actually available to an applicant can be considered for purposes of eligibility for medical indigency benefits, and the board of county commissioners’ finding that other resources were available to the patient was contrary to the evidence.

        When the definition of hospital is analyzed contextually in the statutes, it is clear that the meaning is not confined to those medical institutions within the state. University of Utah Hosp. & Medical Ctr. v. Bethke, 101 Idaho 245, 611 P.2d 1030 (1980).

       <p>
        Where the patient’s medical expenses were about $35,000, and the insurer paid about $26,000 to the hospital, leaving an unpaid balance of about $9,000, the county was only obligated to pay the difference between the reimbursement rate of this section and the amount paid by other sources, not the balance of the total charges after the amount received by other sources was deducted, up to the reimbursement rate. University of Utah Hosp. v. Jefferson County, 111 Idaho 1, 720 P.2d 184 (1986).
    There was substantial and competent evidence to support the county’s conclusion that the decedent was not an Idaho resident because: (1) he did not intend to remain in Idaho as he listed a Montana address on his employment application in Montana and he left blank the space for his permanent address on his application, which he could have used to list an Idaho residence if he intended to remain an Idaho resident; and (2) the decedent’s daughter testified that he did not intend to return to Idaho; therefore, as the decedent was not an Idaho resident, substantial evidence in the record supported the county’s decision denying the medical center’s request for medical assistance to pay for the medical services the decedent received at the medical center. E. Idaho Regl Med. Ctr. v. Ada County Bd. of Comm’rs (In re Hamlet), 139 Idaho 882, 88 P.3d 701 (2004).

        For indigency benefits under this section, the statute provides the proper standard for determining residency in the state is comprised of two parts: (1) physical presence and (2) an intent to remain.

       <p>
        Subsection (12) [now (24)] is not void for vagueness and does not violate equal protection, where the indigent patient clearly was not a resident of Idaho; the payment of medical indigency benefits only to persons who were physically present in Idaho for at least 30 days, and intending to remain in Idaho, was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of allocating limited funds. E. Idaho Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Minidoka County (In re Bermudes), 141 Idaho 157, 106 P.3d 1123 (2005).
       </p>

        Patient was a resident of Ada County for purposes of medical indigency benefits where he had lived in Boise for more than thirty days and intended to remain there while working to support his wife and children in Mexico. His status as an undocumented alien did not affect the determination of whether he was a “resident” or not. St. Alphonsus Reg’l Med. Ctr., Inc. v.

        This section was amended by two 1996 acts — ch. 322, § 14, effective January 1, 1997, and ch. 410, § 4, effective July 1, 1996 — which do not appear to conflict and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 322, § 14, in subdivision (1), deleted the last sentence which read, “Such levy shall be exempt from the limitation imposed in section 63-923(1), Idaho Code.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 410, § 4, in subdivision (1), substituted “residents of their counties” for “, and may provide for the care of other sick persons”, inserted “in the aggregate over a twelve (12) month period” and deleted the last portion which read, “, and for this purpose said boards are authorized to levy an ad valorem tax not to exceed ten one-hundredths of one percent (0.10%) of the market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property in the county. Such levy shall be exempt from the limitation imposed in section 63-923(1), Idaho Code”; added subdivisions (2) and (3); and redesignated former subdivision (2) as subdivision (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 177, in subsection (1), substituted “eleven thousand dollars ($11,000)” for “ten thousand dollars ($10,000)” and inserted “consecutive”; in subsection (2), inserted “with providers” and “county’s”; and rewrote subsection (3), which contained obsolete language concerning pay for emergency services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 273, deleted “boards of” preceding “county commissioners” in the section heading and in the introductory paragraph; in subsection (3), inserted “the board” and “or the board,” and substituted “counties and the board” for “counties and the administrator”; and in subsection (4), substituted “commissioners” for “boards” near the end of the first sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 291, substituted the current subsection (1) for “Care for and maintain the medically indigent residents of their counties as provided in this chapter up to eleven thousand dollars ($11,000) per claim in the aggregate over a consecutive twelve (12) month period with the remainder being paid by the state catastrophic health care cost program pursuant to section 31-3519, Idaho Code”; and inserted “conduct utilization management or any portion thereof” in subsection (2).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 61, inserted “pay for authorized expenses directly, or indirectly through the use of alternative programs, that would assist in managing costs of providing health care for indigent persons” in subsection (2).

        Section 10 of S.L. 1990, ch. 87 amended this section effective October 1, 1991; however, S.L. 1990, ch. 87 was repealed by § 1 of S.L. 1991, ch. 233 and § 19(1) of said ch. 233 declared an emergency and provided that such repeal should take effect upon passage and approval. Chapter 233 of S.L. 1991 became law without the governor’s signature on April 13, 1991. Therefore, the amendment of this section by S.L. 1990, ch. 87 never took effect.
    Section 7 of S.L. 1982, ch. 190 read: “The provisions of this act are hereby declared to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of remaining portions of this act.”

    The 2010 amendment, by ch. 273, in the introductory paragraph in subsection (1), in the third sentence, inserted “providers” and “respective” and substituted “board” for “administrator,” and in the fifth sentence, added “If the clerk determines that the patient may be eligible for medicaid” and inserted “and a written request for medicaid eligibility determination”; added paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(b); in subsection (3), twice substituted “county commissioners” for “board”; in the third and fourth sentences in subsection (4), inserted “the county commissioners and”; and added subsection (5).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 291, in the introductory paragraph in subsection (1), inserted “or third party applicant” three times, inserted “completed” preceding “application” four times, and inserted “an authorized representative of the applicant, or, if the applicant is incompetent or incapacitated, someone acting responsibly for the applicant” in the third sentence; inserted “completed” and deleted “as complete as practicable” following “the application shall be” in subsection (2); inserted “a document entitled: notice of lien and application for financial assistance” and deleted “a notice of application for medical indecency benefits on a uniform form agreed to by the Idaho association of counties and the Idaho hospital association” from the end of the present third sentence in subsection (4); and, inserted “or the board” or “or the board’s” three times in subsection (5).

        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 279, in subsection (5), substituted “medical records and medical claims” for “billings” twice, substituted “to the county clerk of the obligated county within ten(10) days after receiving a request from the county clerk” for “to the department’s or the board’s contractor for its utilization management review within ten (10) business days of receiving notification that the patient is not eligible for medicaid”, substituted “within the ten (10) day period if a provider presents a written request for suspension of the investigation, investigation of the application shall be suspended for up to thirty (30) days” for “upon a showing of good cause, the time period may be extended”, and added the second and fourth sentences.

        The record established that an application was filed by plaintiff’s mother within the proper time period.

        Determination of a “completed application” depends on the identity of the party submitting the application and the knowledge and ability of that party to respond to the inquiries and requests in the application. It is not contemplated that both the applicant/patient and third party applicant will sign the application. Therefore, it was improper to deny a medical center’s third party application as incomplete where it did not contain the signatures of the patients. St. Alphonsus Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Elmore Cnty.

        Lien imposed on a debtor’s property pre-petition for payment of medical bills by a county, that were determined to be payable by the county after the debtor received a discharge, could remain in full force and effect because the lien was not avoidable in bankruptcy and was valid to secure payments that were thereafter advanced to the debtor.

       <p>
        Pre-petition imposition of a lien on property owned by a debtor to protect a county that agreed post-petition to pay the debtor’s medical expenses incurred at a county facility did not violate the debtor’s rights under the United States Constitution under the Fourteenth Amendment, because the debtor received adequate notice that a lien would automatically attach to his property and the debtor had a right to be heard on the issue.

        Bankruptcy court denied a Chapter 7 debtor’s motion for an order avoiding a lien on real property she owned after she asked the county to pay the cost of medical treatment she received in 1998.

        Determination of Indigency.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy of claimant subsequent to her admission to hospital and receipt of treatment could not be used as a benchmark for establishing her indigency. A determination of indigency must be made shortly after patient is admitted for treatment or soon after treatment is finished. The purpose of the statutes is to assure treatment for people who are then unable to pay for their care. It is not a system by which hospitals may collect on accounts receivable which have become unrecoverable due to bankruptcy. University of Utah Hosp. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 113 Idaho 441, 745 P.2d 1062 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the board first denied the application for medical indigency benefits, a pending worker’s compensation claim suggested that there might be other available resources which would pay the medical expenses; so plaintiff did not become medically indigent, as defined in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t31c35s31-3502" target="_self">§ 31-3502</a></cite>, until the industrial commission denied his claim and it was actually determined that the worker’s compensation benefits were not available as a source of payment. St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Ctr., Ltd. v. Canyon County, 120 Idaho 420, 816 P.2d 977 (1991).
    Because a pending medicaid application is not considered an available resource in determining qualification for medical indigency, hospital could not claim the patient became medically indigent after her admission when her medicaid application was denied; thus, this section did not apply and extend the filing deadline for hospital’s medical indigency application. University of Utah Hosp. v. Board of Comm’rs, 128 Idaho 529, 915 P.2d 1387 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory lien for indigent medical services did not survive bankruptcy filing, where the debtors never owned any real property to which the lien could attach. Mechling v. Bonner County, Office of County Assistance, 284 B.R. 127 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of a third party medical indigency application was set aside as an abuse of discretion, because the county failed to carry out its investigative duties by conducting only a minimal investigation and failing to issue a subpoena to the patient; the investigative duties were not alleviated simply because the patient refused to cooperate. University of Utah Hosp. v. Ada County Bd. of Comm’rs, 143 Idaho 808, 153 P.3d 1154 (2007).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the hospital may have been misled by the indigent patient’s false assurance that the application had been completed and filed with the county, the hospital’s reliance on the claimant to complete and file the application with the county was not sufficient to discharge the hospital’s duty of exercising reasonable diligence in presenting some proof of indigency to the county to support the hospital’s claim, as soon after the patient’s admission as was possible. University of Utah Hosp. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 113 Idaho 441, 745 P.2d 1062 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The hospital’s action and reliance on the county’s denial of plaintiff’s claim based on possible worker’s compensation was reasonable and the hospital’s prompt action immediately upon learning that coverage under the worker’s compensation claim had been denied, and filing an application that same day met and satisfied the required standard of diligence, even though it was five days past the statutory period. St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Ctr., Ltd. v. Canyon County, 120 Idaho 420, 816 P.2d 977 (1991).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no requirement that the indigent applicant include the hospital bill with his application; thus, it was clearly inappropriate for county commissioners to deny an application for medical indigency assistance on the sole ground that information regarding the medical bill had not been submitted, without ever notifying an indigent applicant that he or she was expected to provide such information. Carpenter v. Twin Falls County, 107 Idaho 575, 691 P.2d 1190 (1984), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in IHC Hospitals, Inc. v. Teton County, 139 Idaho 188, 75 P.3d 1198 (2003).

        Where the application form submitted by the applicant indicated that she was an indigent with no known assets and that she had no other sources to look to for payment of her medical bills, and the application had been signed by someone on behalf of the applicant and notarized, the application met the requirement of this section that the county be notified as soon as practical of a patient’s indigency; therefore, the application initiated the claim procedure, even though the application was not on the standard form provided by the board of county commissioners. University of Utah Hosp. v. Ada County, 111 Idaho 1023, 729 P.2d 1086 (Ct. App. 1986).
    The inability to explore other treatment possibilities was ample reason to illustrate prejudice and justify the county’s refusal to consider hospital’s application for reimbursement for patient’s care under the medical indigency statutes. Inquiry into whether a county is prejudiced by untimely filing is proper, even in non-emergency cases. University of Utah Hosp. v. Board of Comm’rs, 128 Idaho 529, 915 P.2d 1387 (Ct. App. 1996).

        Where county submitted an affidavit setting out its claim that it was prejudiced in several different respects as a result of hospital’s failure to timely file application on behalf of medically indigent person, such matter having been raised should have been remanded to county commissioners for hearing and findings on the issue of prejudice to the county.

        An untimely application to the county for reimbursement concerning the care furnished to a medically indigent person is not necessarily invalid, as the issue of prejudice to the county resulting from a lack of notice is one which should be inquired into prior to approving or denying an application for indigent medical emergency assistance.

        The district court, and the county clerk as well, in making a determination of medical indigency is required to apply the legislative definition of that term. University of Utah Hosp. & Medical Ctr. v. Eriksen, 100 Idaho 18, 592 P.2d 430 (1979).

        An applicant for medical assistance bears the burden of proving medical indigency. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 107 Idaho 248, 688 P.2d 260 (Ct. App. 1984), rev’d on other grounds, 109 Idaho 299, 707 P.2d 410 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a review of the record clearly demonstrated that claimant did not have income and resources available which would enable him to pay for the emergency medical services provided for his wife, the district court did not err in finding there was no basis in fact for the commissioners’ decision to deny claimant’s application for benefits on the basis that he was not a medically indigent person. Carpenter v. Twin Falls County, 107 Idaho 575, 691 P.2d 1190 (1984), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in IHC Hospitals, Inc. v. Teton County, 139 Idaho 188, 75 P.3d 1198 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a hospital gives emergency treatment to an indigent in an emergency situation without the county board of commissioners’ prior approval, as the hospital is allowed to do under former law concerning approval of claims, then the hospital must use diligence in gathering all reasonably available information relevant to the indigency of the patient, and the hospital should do so as soon after the admission of the patient as is possible. The county, however, cannot place the entire burden of proving indigency, and the entire risk of non-payment, upon the hospital; unless there is reason to believe the hospital has been recalcitrant in investigating the claim of indigency, then, after the presentation of some proof of indigency (not necessarily a prima facie showing) by the hospital, the claim must be paid — This, assuming proof that the care was actually given, that it was necessary, and that the charges rendered therefor were reasonable. IHC Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 136, 697 P.2d 1150, overruled on other grounds, Intermountain Health Care v. Board of County Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 757, 702 P.2d 795 (1985).
    Under Idaho’s medical indigency statutes, the applicant bears the burden of proving medical indigency. However, this duty is not absolute. The clerk of the board of county commissioners has a reciprocal duty to make reasonable inquiry into the grounds for the application. Salinas v. Canyon County, 117 Idaho 218, 786 P.2d 611 (Ct. App. 1990).

       <p>
        Where neither parent can be found and the claimant hospital has made reasonable effort to ascertain the child’s indigency, the hospital will be held to have made a prima facie showing of medical indigency, and the burden of proof on the question of indigency will then shift to the county. IHC Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 136, 697 P.2d 1150, overruled on other grounds, Intermountain Health Care v. Board of County Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 757, 702 P.2d 795 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Idaho’s medical indigency statutes, the applicant bears the burden of proving medical indigency. However, this duty is not absolute. The clerk of the board of county commissioners has a reciprocal duty to make reasonable inquiry into the grounds for the application. Salinas v. Canyon County, 117 Idaho 218, 786 P.2d 611 (Ct. App. 1990).

       <p>
        A duty must be placed upon the county to insure that medical indigency applications are accurate and authentic; placing the burden of proving medical indigency and the burden of refuting all reasonable inferences to the contrary on the applicant would defeat this purpose.

        Expert Testimony.
       </h5>
       <p>
        If a hospital gave emergency treatment to an indigent in an emergency situation without the county board of commissioners’ prior approval, as the hospital was allowed to do under former law concerning allowance of approved claims only, then the hospital must have used diligence in gathering all reasonably available information relevant to the indigency of the patient, and the hospital should do so as soon after the admission of the patient as is possible. The county, however, could not place the entire burden of proving indigency, and the entire risk of non-payment, upon the hospital; unless there is reason to believe the hospital had been recalcitrant in investigating the claim of indigency, then, after presentation of some proof of indigency (not necessarily a prima facie showing) by the hospital, the claim had to be paid — this, assuming proof that the care was actually given, that it was necessary, and that the charges rendered therefor were reasonable. IHC Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 136, 697 P.2d 1150, overruled on other grounds, Intermountain Health Care v. Board of County Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 757, 702 P.2d 795 (1985). Expert Testimony.
       </p>
       <p>
        The blanket requirement of the county commissioners, for presentation of “expert” testimony in determining medical indigency, the necessity for medical treatment, and the reasonableness of the hospital bills, is not necessarily correct; the type of testimony warranted can only be determined on consideration of the facts in each case. IHC Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 136, 697 P.2d 1150, overruled on other grounds, Intermountain Health Care v. Board of County Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 757, 702 P.2d 795 (1985).

        Where an investigation by the county would have been superfluous, since the hospital’s own evidence rebutted its argument of timeliness, and no harm to the applicant resulted from the county’s failure to investigate, the application would not be deemed approved, because the county denied it without conducting an independent investigation.

        Applicant for medical assistance and the pursuing party must have an identity of interest; such an interest existed where the application concerned only the bill from a health care corporation although there were substantial other medical bills outstanding, and the application was made at the instance of the corporation on a form provided by them with their assistance; therefore, the corporation had the right to pursue the application to the extent allowed by statute, and thus, the company could be considered an “applicant” and was a proper party to bring appeal of board’s denial of application.

        A medical indigency application submitted to a board of county commissioners, and neither approved nor denied in writing by the commissioners within 60 days, is automatically approved. St. Luke’s Regional Medical Ctr., Ltd. v. Gem County, 107 Idaho 998, 695 P.2d 383 (1985).

       <p>
        When an application is not timely denied, its factual averments will be deemed true and the applicant will be entitled to such payments as the medical indigency statutes provide in relation to the facts averred; the applicant has no obligation to reestablish the factual prerequisites to payment at a subsequent administrative hearing occasioned by the county’s tardy denial of the application. Hardcastle v. Board of Comm’rs, 110 Idaho 956, 719 P.2d 1216 (Ct. App. 1986).

        Where a medical indigency application is deemed approved pursuant to this section, the county should be held liable for payment from the date the application was received by the county. Hardcastle v. Board of Comm’rs, 110 Idaho 956, 719 P.2d 1216 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the letter sent by the county to the nursing home was merely a request for additional information, not a denial of the patient’s application, the district court correctly determined that the county failed to timely deny the nursing home patient’s application for indigent benefits to pay for medications not reimbursed by state medicaid, resulting in its deemed approval. Hardcastle v. Board of Comm’rs, 110 Idaho 956, 719 P.2d 1216 (Ct. App. 1986).
    If the county fails to notify the applicant in writing of its decision within 60 days from the receipt of the application, the application is automatically deemed approved. University of Utah Hosp. v. Ada County, 111 Idaho 1023, 729 P.2d 1086 (Ct. App. 1986).

        An application for county medical assistance was “deemed approved” when the county failed to respond to it in a timely manner. Ottesen ex rel. Edwards v. Board of Comm’rs, 107 Idaho 1099, 695 P.2d 1238 (1985).

        Former section required the board of county commissioners, within 60 days from receipt of a medical indigency application, to notify the applicant in writing of the action taken on his application; absent such written notice, the application was deemed approved. Thus, where the commissioners did not notify the hospital in writing of their action, rather, they orally informed the hospital that the claim was denied, the application — if in fact a proper application was made in writing — had to be deemed approved. St. Benedict’s Hosp. v. County of Twin Falls, 107 Idaho 143, 686 P.2d 88 (Ct. App. 1984).

        The mailing of notice within the 60-day period satisfies the time requirement for giving notice under this section, even if the notice is not received until after that period has expired. University of Utah Hosp. v. Twin Falls County, 113 Idaho 447, 745 P.2d 1068 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        An untimely application to the county for reimbursement concerning the care furnished to a medically indigent person is not necessarily invalid, as the issue of prejudice to the county resulting from a lack of notice is one which should be inquired into prior to approving or denying an application for indigent medical emergency assistance.

        The blanket requirement of the county commissioners, for presentation of “expert” testimony in determining medical indigency, the necessity for medical treatment, and the reasonableness of the hospital bills, is not necessarily correct; the type of testimony warranted can only be determined on consideration of the facts in each case.

        Action by a county upon a medical indigency application is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); the APA provides that review must be sought by a petition filed in the district court. However, where administrative action reviewable under the APA is challenged by complaint rather than by a petition for judicial review, the proper court response is not to dismiss the complaint but to treat it as a petition governed by the APA. St. Benedict’s Hosp. v. County of Twin Falls, 107 Idaho 143, 686 P.2d 88 (Ct. App. 1984).

        Where the hospital failed to demand a hearing before the board of county commissioners after denial of medical assistance benefits by county commissioners, it provided the district court and this appellate court no record for review. University of Utah Hosp. v. Minidoka County, 115 Idaho 406, 767 P.2d 249 (1987).

       <p>
        Under Idaho’s Administrative Procedure Act, which is made applicable to indigent medical claims by this section, when an appeal of an administrative ruling is brought to a district court and the findings of fact to be reviewed are missing or inadequate, the district court should remand the case to the board of county commissioners. University of Utah Hosp. v. Clerk of Minidoka County, 114 Idaho 662, 760 P.2d 1 (1988).

        Applicant for medical assistance and the pursuing party must have an identity of interest; such an interest existed where the application concerned only the bill from a health care corporation, although there were substantial other medical bills outstanding, and the application was made at the instance of the corporation on a form provided by them with their assistance; therefore, the corporation had the right to pursue the application to the extent allowed by statute, and thus, the company could be considered an “applicant” and a proper party to bring appeal of board’s denial of application.

        Indigent claimants who were notified by the county commissioners that their county aid had been terminated were not required to exhaust the administrative remedy contained in this section as a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining their court action against the commissioners, because the administrative remedy pertains to the denial of an individual’s application for indigency aid, not to the termination of such aid.

        The meaning of the former first sentence of this section “Payment for hospitalization of a medically indigent individual shall be provided by the county in which such individual maintained a residence immediately preceding hospitalization or institutionalization.” as it read prior to the 1988 amendment was clear on its face; a medically indigent person’s residence at the time of hospitalization should be used to determine the county liable for payment of that person’s hospitalization costs. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 685, 710 P.2d 595 (1985).
       </p>

        In amending the former first sentence of this section in 1976, “ Payment for hospitalization of a medically indigent individual shall be provided by the county in which such individual last resided for a period of six months during five years preceding hospitalization.” by deleting the words, “last resided for a period of six months during the five years” following “which such individual” and adding “maintained a residence immediately” preceding the word, “preceding” and adding “or institutionalization” at the end of the sentence, the legislature intended that the liable county be determined on the basis of residency immediately preceding hospitalization, rather than where the medically indigent person last resided for a period of six months. Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Comm’rs, 109 Idaho 685, 710 P.2d 595 (1985).

        The county is not relieved of its financial obligations to a medically indigent person injured while within the territorial limits of the county merely because such person was not a resident of the county or the state of Idaho when the injuries were suffered and did not subsequently become such a resident.

        County in which indigent patient’s family was living at the time the need for emergency medical care arose was ruled the obligatory county for purposes of paying the patient’s medical bills, even though the patient’s family intended to return to the county in which they had previously lived, and in fact did so shortly after the hospitalization.

        If a hospital gives emergency treatment to an indigent in an emergency situation without the county board of commissioners’ prior approval, as the hospital is allowed to do under former law concerning approval of claims, then the hospital must use diligence in gathering all reasonably available information relevant to the indigency of the patient, and the hospital should do so as soon after the admission of the patient as is possible. The county, however, cannot place the entire burden of proving indigency, and the entire risk of non-payment, upon the hospital; unless there is reason to believe the hospital has been recalcitrant in investigating the claim of indigency, then, after the presentation of some proof of indigency (not necessarily a prima facie showing) by the hospital, the claim must be paid — This, assuming proof that the care was actually given, that it was necessary, and that the charges rendered therefor were reasonable. IHC Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 136, 697 P.2d 1150, overruled on other grounds, Intermountain Health Care v. Board of County Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 757, 702 P.2d 795 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The blanket requirement of the county commissioners, for presentation of “expert” testimony in determining medical indigency, the necessity for medical treatment, and the reasonableness of the hospital bills, is not necessarily correct; the type of testimony warranted can only be determined on consideration of the facts in each case. IHC Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 136, 697 P.2d 1150, overruled on other grounds, Intermountain Health Care v. Board of County Comm’rs, 108 Idaho 757, 702 P.2d 795 (1985).

      The county commissioners may, when they deem the welfare of their counties require it, or when petitioned thereto by a number of resident taxpayers of their respective counties equal to five percent (5%) of the number of persons voting for the secretary of state of the state of Idaho, at the election next preceding the date of such petition, submit to the qualified electors of said county at any election held as provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, the proposition whether negotiable coupon bonds of the county to the amount stated in such proposition shall be issued and sold for the purpose of providing such hospital, hospital grounds, nurses’ homes, nursing homes, residential or assisted living facilities, shelter care facilities, medical clinics, superintendent’s quarters, or any other necessary buildings, and equipment, and may on their own initiative submit to the qualified electors of the county at any general election the proposition whether negotiable coupon bonds of the county to the amount stated in such proposition shall be issued and sold for the purpose of providing for the extension and enlargement of existing hospital, hospital grounds, nurses’ homes, nursing homes, residential or assisted living facilities, shelter care facilities, medical clinics or grounds, superintendent’s quarters, or any other necessary buildings, and equipment, and when authorized thereto by two-thirds (2/3) vote at such election, shall issue and sell such coupon bonds and use the proceeds therefrom for the purposes authorized by such election. Said proposition may be submitted to the qualified electors at an election held subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, if the county commissioners shall by resolution so determine. No person shall be qualified to vote at any election held under the provisions of this section unless he shall possess all the qualifications required of electors under the general laws of this state.

The purpose for which it is decided to spend such moneys shall be clearly and plainly stated on the ballot. If a majority of the qualified electors shall vote in favor of spending such moneys for the purpose stated, the county commissioners shall proceed in the same manner as if such different purpose had been the original purpose for such bond issue or appropriation. Provided, further that if less than a majority of the qualified electors shall vote in favor of spending such moneys for such different purpose, or if no such election should be had, when all of the bonds shall have been retired, such excess moneys shall be placed in the general fund.

        Where complaint against bond issue failed to allege that petition for special bond election had an insufficient number of resident taxpayer signers but alleged persons signing such petition were not qualified electors and taxpayers, such complaint was defective since the county commissioners were given the implied right to determine the sufficiency of the petition.

        District court had jurisdiction of proceeding by taxpayer to contest result of election to determine whether county commissioners should issue bonds to build a hospital based on contention that nontaxpayers were permitted to vote, regardless of whether suit was in equity or in law.

        In special bond election held on June 8, 1950 for construction of hospital, restriction of voting to persons, whose names appeared on 1949 tax rolls was proper, since 1950 tax rolls had not been completed at the time of the election.

      The counties in the state of Idaho and the health providers furnishing care to eligible medically indigent persons, as defined in section 31-3502, Idaho Code, are directed to cooperate in providing an advisory panel in the nature of a special civil grand jury and procedure for prelitigation consideration of claims arising out of contested resource availability of persons applying for indigent relief under the provisions of chapter 35, title 31, Idaho Code, which proceedings shall be informal and nonbinding, but nevertheless compulsory as a condition precedent to litigation. Proceedings conducted or maintained under the authority of this chapter shall be subject to disclosure according to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply and all such proceedings shall be expeditious and informal. The panel, thus created, will render opinions where the resource eligibility of applicants, as herein described, has been contested.

It shall be the duty of the secretary of the board to keep an accurate and complete record of all acts and proceedings of the board. It shall be the duty of the treasurer to have custody of all funds coming into the custody of the board and he shall perform such other duties as are herein specified, and he shall give bond in such amount as shall be fixed by the board in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions as required for the official bonds of county officers. All officers of the hospital board shall be subject to removal by said board at any time. The hospital board and any of its officers or members may be paid reasonable compensation as shall be authorized by the board and/or council authorized to appoint the members of the board.

      Any county having adopted and established an ambulance service pursuant to section 31-3901, Idaho Code, prior to July 1, 2020, may terminate the same for good cause by the adoption of a resolution by the board of county commissioners. Upon the termination of said ambulance service, all vehicles and property not necessary for other county purposes shall be sold and the proceeds therefrom paid to the county treasurer to be deposited in the general fund of the county. All moneys on deposit in the ambulance service fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the county. Provided, however, in the event that an ambulance service district formed pursuant to section 31-3911, Idaho Code, is succeeding the terminated ambulance service by the county, then the board of county commissioners may adopt a resolution providing that the vehicles and property shall instead be transferred to the new ambulance service district.

      The provisions of sections 31-3911 through 31-3922, Idaho Code, shall govern any ambulance service district formed on and after July 1, 2020:

     <ol>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3911ol11">
       A petition to form an ambulance service district must be signed by no fewer than fifty (50) qualified electors within the proposed district. The petition shall designate the boundaries of the proposed district, shall state the name of the proposed district, and shall be accompanied by a map of the proposed district. The petition shall be filed with the county clerk and recorder of the county or counties in which the proposed district lies. Upon the filing of the petition, each county clerk shall examine the petition and certify whether the required number of petitioners have signed the petition.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3911ol12">
       Any incorporated city that lies within the boundaries of a proposed ambulance service district must pass a resolution consenting to participation in the ambulance service district before the district may be formed. Copies of the city resolutions must be filed with the county clerk or clerks by the petitioners at the time of filing the petition.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3911ol13">
       At the time of filing the petition, the petitioners shall deposit with the county clerk a sufficient sum of money to cover the cost of publication of the petition and all necessary notices. If the petition and notices are not published, the deposit shall be returned to the petitioners, and if there is any surplus remaining after paying for the publication as provided in this section, it shall be returned to the petitioners. If a district is created, the petitioners shall be reimbursed the amount of their deposit from the first tax moneys collected by the district.

      <li id="t31c39s31-3911ol14">
       If the provisions of subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section have been met, the clerk or clerks shall transmit the petition and city resolutions to the board or boards of county commissioners.

No more than five (5) names attached to the petition shall appear in the publication and notice, but the number of signatures shall be stated. If the district is to be situated in two (2) or more counties, each board of county commissioners shall coordinate the hearing date and the publications of notice so that only one (1) hearing need be held.

      <li id="t31c39s31-3911ol15">
       After hearing and considering any and all testimony, the county commissioners shall make an order denying or granting the petition, with or without modifications. Any order granting the petition shall state the name and fix the boundaries of the proposed district. The boundaries so fixed shall be the boundaries of the district after its organization is completed according to law. A map showing the boundaries of the proposed district as finally fixed and determined by the board or boards of county commissioners shall be prepared and filed in the office of the clerk of the county or counties.

      <li id="t31c39s31-3911ol16">
       Following the issuance of an order by the county commissioners fixing the name and boundaries of the proposed district, the county clerk shall publish notice of an election to be held on the May or November election date set forth in section 34-106, Idaho Code, for the purpose of determining whether or not the proposed district shall be organized. The notice shall state the name and boundaries of the proposed district and shall state that a map showing the boundaries of the proposed district is on file in the clerk’s office. The notice shall require the electors to cast ballots that contain the words “. . . ambulance service district, yes” or “. . . ambulance service district, no” or words equivalent thereto.

     <ol>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3912ol11">
       At the meeting of the board of county commissioners at which the ambulance service district is declared organized, as provided in section 31-3911, Idaho Code, the county commissioners shall divide the ambulance service district into three (3) subdivisions, as nearly equal in population, area, and mileage as practicable, to be known as ambulance service commissioner subdistricts 1, 2, and 3. No more than one (1) of the ambulance service district commissioners shall be a resident of the same ambulance service subdistrict. The first commissioners appointed by the board of county commissioners shall serve until the next ambulance service district election, at which time their successors shall be elected. On the first Tuesday following the first Monday of November, of the next odd-numbered year following the organization of an ambulance service district, three (3) ambulance service district commissioners shall be elected. The term of office for ambulance service commissioners shall commence on the second Monday of January succeeding each general election. Commissioners appointed or elected must be electors residing within the ambulance service district for at least one (1) year immediately preceding their appointment or election. At the first election following organization of an ambulance service district, the commissioner from ambulance service subdistrict 1 shall be elected to a term of two (2) years and the commissioners from subdistricts 2 and 3 shall be elected to a term of four (4) years; thereafter, the term of office of all commissioners shall be four (4) years. For commissioners whose term in office expires in any even-numbered year, such commissioners shall remain in office until the next election in an odd-numbered year. Such elections and all other elections held under this chapter shall be held in conformity with the general laws of the state including chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3912ol12">
       Any ambulance service commissioner vacancy occurring, other than by the expiration of the term of office, shall be filled by the board of ambulance service commissioners. If a duly elected or appointed ambulance service commissioner resigns, withdraws, becomes disqualified, refuses or, without first providing signed written notice of a temporary vacancy, becomes otherwise unable to perform the duties of office for longer than ninety (90) days, the board, on satisfactory proof of the vacancy, shall declare the office vacant. The board shall fill any vacancies within sixty (60) days of learning of the vacancy. When a vacancy occurs, the board shall direct the secretary to cause a notice of the vacancy to be published in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper of general circulation within the district. The notice shall include the date and time of the meeting when the board will vote to fill the vacancy and the deadline for qualified elector residents interested in being appointed to the position to submit a written request for appointment to the board. Should the remaining members of the board fail to agree on an individual to fill the vacancy, it shall select the individual by placing the names of all interested persons who received the highest and equal number of votes in a container. The ambulance service commissioner with the most continuous length of service shall draw one (1) name from the container. The person whose name is drawn shall then be appointed to fill the vacancy.
    (3) If more than fifty percent (50%) of the elected official seats on an ambulance service district board of commissioners are vacant, any remaining member of the ambulance service district board of commissioners, or any elector of the ambulance service district, may petition the board of county commissioners of the county or counties in which the subdistrict vacancies are situated to make such appointments as are necessary to fill the vacancies on the ambulance service district board of commissioners. The vacancies shall be filled by the board or boards of county commissioners within sixty (60) days of receiving a written petition. Any ambulance service commissioner so appointed shall serve out the remainder of the term for the commissioner last serving in the vacant seat to be filled and shall be a resident of the same ambulance service commissioner’s subdistrict.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (4) The board of ambulance service district commissioners may revise subdistricts when they deem it necessary due to significant shifts in population. The board of ambulance service district commissioners shall revise subdistricts upon any annexation of territory into the district and, in any case, within six (6) months following the end of each decennial United States census reporting year so as to equalize the population, area, and mileage between the subdistricts as nearly as practicable. Of the commissioners comprising the board, no more than one (1) commissioner shall be a resident of the same ambulance service commissioner’s subdistrict. The revision of subdistricts shall not disqualify any elected commissioner from the completion of the term for which he has been duly elected. Notice of revised ambulance service commissioner subdistricts shall be provided to the county clerk of the county or counties in which the changes occur by means of a resolution that includes a map depicting the revised subdistrict boundaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) In any election for ambulance service district commissioner, if, after the deadline for filing a declaration of intent as a write-in candidate, it appears that only one (1) qualified candidate has been nominated for a subdistrict to be filled, it shall not be necessary for the candidate of that subdistrict to stand for election, and the board of the ambulance service district commissioners shall declare such candidate elected as commissioner, and the secretary of the district shall immediately make and deliver to such person a certificate of election.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) The results of any election for ambulance service district commissioner shall be certified by the county clerk of the county or counties of the district and the results reported to the ambulance service district.

      § 31-3922. Dissolution.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Dissolution of any ambulance service district organized under the provisions of section 31-3911, Idaho Code, may be initiated by a petition signed by at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the qualified electors within the ambulance service district, requesting dissolution of the ambulance service district, in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3922ol11">
       The petition shall first be presented to the board of county commissioners of each county in which the ambulance service district is situated, signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, which petition shall clearly designate the boundaries of the ambulance service district and shall state the name of the district and shall be accompanied by a map thereof. The petition, together with all maps and other papers filed therewith, shall, at proper hours, be open to public inspection in the office of the clerk of the board of county commissioners between the date of said filing and the date of the election on the question of districts as provided in this section. The petition may be in one (1) or in several papers. When such petition is presented to the board of county commissioners and filed in the office of the clerk of the board, the said board shall set a time for hearing of such petition, which time shall not be less than four (4) nor more than six (6) weeks from the date of the presenting and filing of said petition. A notice of the time of such hearing shall be published by said board, once a week for three (3) successive weeks previous to the time set for such hearing, in a newspaper published within the county in which said district is situated. Said notice shall give the boundaries of the ambulance service district and shall state that a petition has been filed to dissolve the same and that, on the date fixed for the hearing, any taxpayer within the district may appear at the hearing and testify and present exhibits upon any issue pertaining to the proposed dissolution of the ambulance service district or may object to or support the proposed dissolution.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3922ol12">
       After hearing and considering any and all testimony and other evidence made either in favor of or in opposition to the dissolution of the ambulance service district, if the board of county commissioners makes a sufficient factual finding that the majority of the residents of the ambulance service district will receive no benefit by continuing the existence of the ambulance service district, the county commissioners shall make an order granting the petition, with or without modification. If the board of county commissioners, after hearing and considering all testimony and other evidence either in favor of or in opposition to the dissolution of the ambulance service district, cannot make a sufficient factual finding that the majority of the residents of the ambulance service district will receive no benefit by continuing the existence of the ambulance service district, the county commissioners shall make an order denying the petition. After the county commissioners have entered their order approving or denying such petition, the clerk of the board of county commissioners shall cause to be published a notice of election to be held in such proposed ambulance service district for the purpose of determining whether or not the same shall be dissolved. Such notice shall plainly and clearly designate the boundaries of the ambulance service district, its name, and that the election is to be held to decide the question of whether the ambulance service district shall be maintained or dissolved. Such notice shall be published once each week in a newspaper published within the county for three (3) successive publications prior to such election.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3922ol13">
       Such notice shall require the electors to cast ballots that shall contain the words “. . . ambulance service district dissolved, yes” or “. . . ambulance service district dissolved, no” or words equivalent thereto. No person shall be entitled to vote at any election held under the provisions of this chapter unless he shall possess all the qualifications required of electors under the general laws of the state and be a resident of the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3922ol14">
       If a majority of the electors voting at such election shall vote to dissolve the ambulance service district, the board of county commissioners shall, after certifying the results of such election, enter an order upon the minutes of its official proceedings dissolving said ambulance service district, and such district shall thereupon be dissolved.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3922ol15">
       The property of such district shall remain the property of the county in which such district is located and any money remaining in the fund of such district shall be expended in the maintenance and repair of the highways of such district, whether such highways at the time of the dissolution are in the incorporated territory or in unincorporated territory.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c39s31-3922ol16">
       If the district is situated in two (2) or more counties, each board of county commissioners shall coordinate the hearing date and the publications of notice so that only one (1) hearing need be held. Unless otherwise agreed to by each board of county commissioners involved, the hearing shall be held at the administrative offices of the district, and the boards of county commissioners are hereby specifically authorized to act in a joint manner for such purposes. If an election is called, the boards of county commissioners shall provide that the election be held on the same day in each county, and the boards of county commissioners shall coordinate the canvass of the votes cast and make one (1) joint announcement. If a majority of votes in any county are against the dissolution of the district, such rejection shall void the dissolution of the district in all counties.

      § 31-4205. Creation of housing authorities.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any county of the state of Idaho, there may be created an independent public body corporate and politic to be known as a housing authority, which shall not be an agency of the county; provided, however, that such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the governing body of the county, by proper resolution, shall declare, at any time hereafter, that there is need for an authority to function in such county. The determination as to whether or not there is such need for an authority to function (a) may be made by the governing body on its own motion or (b) shall be made by the governing body upon the filing of a petition signed by twenty-five (25) residents of the county asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such county and requesting that the governing body so declare.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is need for a housing authority in the county if it shall find (a) that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such county or (b) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such county available to persons of low income or rentals they can afford. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or insanitary, said governing body may take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the sanitary facilities and the extent to which conditions exist in such building which endanger life or property by fire or other causes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this act shall prevent governing bodies from jointly creating by resolution an independent public body corporate and politic to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this act and to serve the best interests of their respective citizenry.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceeding, involving the validity of enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority. Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is such need for an authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms, no further detail being necessary, that either or both of the above enumerated conditions exist in the county. A copy of such resolution, duly certified by the clerk, shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.

Upon resolution by a governing body of a county, after an authority has been created with either five (5) or seven (7) commissioners, the number of commissioners may be increased from five (5) to seven (7) or reduced from seven (7) to five (5). No commissioner of any authority may be an officer or employee of the county for which the authority is created. A commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and qualified. A certificate of appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner. The service of a housing assistance recipient appointed as a commissioner pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1437(b) shall be contingent upon his continued receipt of housing assistance. A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services for the authority in any capacity, but he shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties.

     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t31c43s31-4304ol1a">
       Any person or persons may file a petition for the formation of a recreation district with the clerk. Such petition which may be in one (1) or more papers shall clearly designate the boundaries of the proposed district, shall state the name of the proposed district, shall state the maximum tax rate that would be imposed upon taxable property within the district or planned unit development recreation districts, and shall be signed by not less than twenty percent (20%) of the qualified electors resident within the boundaries of the proposed district. The boundaries of the proposed district shall include contiguous territory having market value for assessment purposes of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) at the last preceding county assessment and shall not include any area included within an already existing recreation district. The petition shall be accompanied by a map showing the boundaries of the proposed district.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c43s31-4304ol1b">
       The clerk shall, within ten (10) days after the filing of such petition and map, estimate the cost of advertising and holding the election provided in this section and notify in writing the person or any one of the persons filing such petition as to the amount of such estimate. Such person or persons shall within twenty (20) days after receipt of such written notice deposit such estimated amount with the clerk in cash, or such petition shall be deemed withdrawn. If the deposit is made and the district is formed, the person or persons so depositing such sum shall be reimbursed from the first moneys collected by the district from the taxes authorized to be levied by this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c43s31-4304ol1c">
       Within thirty (30) days after the filing of such petition together with such map and the making of such cash deposit, the county commissioners shall determine whether or not the same substantially comply with the requirements of this section. If the county commissioners find that there has not been substantial compliance with such requirements, they shall enter an order to the effect specifying the particular deficiencies, dismissing such petition and refunding such cash deposit. If the county commissioners find that there has been substantial compliance with such requirements, the county commissioners shall forthwith enter an order to that effect and calling an election, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, upon the formation of such proposed district as provided in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c43s31-4304ol1d">
       If the county commissioners order an election as provided in this section, such election shall be conducted in accordance with the general election laws of the state, including the provisions of chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code. The county commissioners shall establish election precincts, design and print elector’s oaths, ballots and other necessary supplies, appoint election personnel and by rule and regulation provide for the conduct and tally of such election. Each qualified elector who is a resident of the proposed district shall be entitled to vote in such election. The clerk shall give notice of such election which notice shall clearly designate the boundaries of such proposed district, shall state the name of the proposed district as designated in the petition, shall state the date of such election and the hours on such date which the polls will be open for receipt of ballots, shall set forth the qualifications of electors, and shall state that a map showing the boundaries of such district is on file in the office of the clerk. Such notice shall be published for the first time, not less than twelve (12) days prior to the election, and the second publication shall be made not less than five (5) days prior to such election in a newspaper published within the county.

       Immediately after such election, the judges at such election shall forward the ballots and results of such election to the clerk.

If more than one-half (½) of the votes cast at such election are in favor of forming such district, the county commissioners shall enter an order so finding, declaring such district duly organized under the name designated in such petition, and dividing such district into three (3) subdivisions, as nearly equal in population as possible, to be known as director’s subdistricts one, two and three. The county commissioners shall cause one (1) certified copy of such order to be filed in the office of the county recorder of such county. Immediately upon the entry of such order, the organization of such district shall be complete.

The appointees from director’s subdistricts one and two shall serve until the first district election thereafter held at which their successors shall be elected and the appointee from director’s subdistrict three shall serve until the second district election thereafter held at which such appointee’s successor shall be elected. The certificate of appointment shall be filed with the clerk with a copy forwarded to each appointee.

      § 31-4323. Creation of indebtedness for works or improvements — Election on proposed indebtedness.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the board of a recreation district shall, by resolution, determine that the interest of said district and the public interest or necessity demand the acquisition, construction, installation, completion or maintenance of any purpose stated in section 31-4316, Idaho Code, equipment or apparatus to carry out the objects or purposes of said district requiring the creation of an indebtedness exceeding the income and revenue provided for the year, the board shall order the submission of the proposition of issuing such obligations or bonds or creating other indebtedness to the qualified electors, at an election held, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, for that purpose. The declaration of public interest or necessity, herein required, and the provision for the holding of such election, may be included within one and the same resolution, which resolution, in addition to such declaration of public interest or necessity, shall recite the objects and purposes for which the indebtedness is proposed to be incurred, the estimated cost of the works or improvements, as the case may be, the amount of principal of the indebtedness to be incurred therefor, and the maximum rate of interest to be paid on such indebtedness. Such resolutions shall also fix the date upon which such election shall be held, and the manner of holding the same, which shall be in accordance with the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code, and the method of voting for or against the incurring of the proposed indebtedness. The county commissioners, pursuant to section 34-302, Idaho Code, shall designate the polling place or places and the county clerk shall appoint for each polling place, from the qualified electors, the judges of such election, provided, however, that no district shall issue or have outstanding its coupon bonds in excess of two percent (2%) of market value for assessment purposes of the real estate and personal property within the said district or in excess of ten percent (10%) of market value for assessment purposes of real estate and personal property within a district created pursuant to section 31-4304A, Idaho Code, according to the assessment of the year preceding any such issuance of such evidence of indebtedness for any or all of the propositions specified in this election.

        This section was amended by two 1995 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 118, § 43, near the end of the first sentence, following “at an election held” inserted “, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code,”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 353, § 7, in the first sentence, substituted “purpose stated in section 43-4316, Idaho Code” for “buildings”, following “the creation of an indebtedness” deleted “of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more, and in any event, when the indebtedness will”, substituted “exceeding” for “exceed”, and near the end of the section, added “or in excess of ten percent (10%) of market value for assessment of purposes of real estate and personal property within a district created pursuant to section 31-4304A, Idaho Code” preceding “according to the assessment of the year”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 341, corrected the section reference in the first sentence and subdivided and rewrote the former last sentence to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.

       Major solid waste generators and municipalities operating solid waste collection or disposal systems pursuant to the authority conferred by law or desiring to initiate or abandon such systems shall conform to the procedures and standards set forth in this section before taking any action which would significantly affect the amount or distribution of solid waste within any county. The board of county commissioners of any county may waive operation of the procedure called for in this section by passage of a resolution indicating their intent to do so.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c44s31-4407Aol12">
       Whenever a county shall propose the establishment of a new solid waste processing facility within the boundaries of the county or in conjunction with adjoining counties, it shall give notice to all municipalities within its boundaries that it intends to establish a processing facility. In conjunction with the notice, the county shall provide a copy of a feasibility study prepared by a licensed professional engineer concerning the proposed processing facility which shall address the estimated capital cost of the facility, estimated costs of operation of the facility, and the estimated life span of the facility. The notice shall be provided to potentially affected municipalities at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the scheduled initiation of construction of any solid waste processing facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c44s31-4407Aol13">
       Within ninety (90) days of receipt of the notice, each affected municipality shall respond to the notice provided by the county, indicating in its response the intention of the municipality to participate in the use of the proposed facility or to develop or continue operation of an independent solid waste processing facility of its own for the projected duration of the proposed county project.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c44s31-4407Aol14">
       Pursuant to the responses received from affected municipalities, the county proposing development of the solid waste processing facility may tender contracts to participating municipalities assuring the availability of waste disposal capacity at the proposed facility for any duration promised by contract and securing commitments from the municipalities to participate in use of the facility for the duration of its projected life. The contracts shall not constitute guarantees of costs or duration of serviceability of the proposed facility. The contracts may provide for annual adjustments to reflect changes in the relative contribution rates of municipalities to the waste stream feeding the disposal facility. No capital contribution obligation shall extend beyond fifteen (15) years. Additional contracts for capital participation may be proposed and entered into after the expiration of the initial agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c44s31-4407Aol15">
       Any municipality which indicates its intent not to participate in a proposed facility shall be barred from later participation without the consent of the board of county commissioners and without payment of a capital contribution adequate to finance the cost of additional capacity adequate to accommodate the waste stream generated within the municipality. The amount and method of payment of the capital contribution shall be established by the board of county commissioners.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c44s31-4407Aol16">
       Any municipality which elects to participate in a given solid waste processing facility, but later elects to withdraw from said project, may do so, but shall remain obligated for any capital costs incurred in its behalf, but may receive partial credit for operational economies created by its withdrawal. The burden of proof of the extent of operational economies shall rest upon the withdrawing municipality.
    (7) Major solid waste generators located outside participating municipalities shall be treated in the same manner as municipalities concerning commitments to waste facility capacity. Boards of county commissioners are authorized to enter into contracts with major solid waste generators for the expected duration of operation of any solid waste processing facility.

      § 31-4505. Bonds.
     </h3>
     <p>
      All revenue bonds authorized to be issued hereunder may be issued as serial bonds or as term bonds or a combination of both types. All revenue bonds so issued shall be payable solely out of the revenues and receipts derived by the county from the pollution control facilities provided with the proceeds thereof as may be designated in the proceedings of the board under which the revenue bonds shall be authorized to be issued, provided that such revenue bonds shall not be secured by the full faith and credit or the taxing power of the state of Idaho or of any political subdivision thereof, and such limitation shall be plainly printed on the face of each such revenue bond. Such revenue bonds may be executed and delivered by the county at any time and from time to time in such amounts, may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in fully registered form or in bearer form registrable either as to principal or interest or both, may bear such conversion privileges and be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date thereof, may be payable at such time or times and at such place or places whether within or without the state of Idaho and evidenced in such manner, may bear interest at such rate or rates per annum without regard to any interest rate limitation appearing in any other law, may be executed by the manual or facsimile signatures of such officers of the county, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as shall be provided in the proceedings of the board under which the revenue bonds shall be authorized to be issued. If deemed advisable by the board there may be retained in the proceedings under which any such revenue bonds are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such proceedings, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such proceedings, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on any county the right or option to redeem any such revenue bonds except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they shall be issued. Any revenue bonds issued hereunder may be sold at public or private sale for such price and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the board, and the county may pay, but solely and only from the proceeds of any such revenue bonds, all expenses, premiums and commissions which the board may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof. Issuance by any county of one (1) or more series of revenue bonds for one (1) or more purposes under this act shall not preclude it from issuing other revenue bonds in connection with the same pollution control facility or any other pollution control facility or for any other purpose hereunder, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge made for any prior issue of revenue bonds. Any revenue bonds issued hereunder at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by the issuance of refunding bonds in such amount as the board may deem necessary but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums, commissions, service fees and other expenses necessary to be paid in connection therewith. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be refunded, and regardless of whether or not the bonds to be refunded were issued in connection with the same pollution control facility or separate pollution control facilities or for any other purpose hereunder, and regardless of whether or not the revenue bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise. All such revenue bonds and the interest coupons applicable thereto, if any, are hereby made and shall be construed to be negotiable instruments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds hereunder and the execution of an indenture as security therefor shall be published one (1) time in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. Any such indenture, or other instrument authorized in such resolution to be executed, may be incorporated as an exhibit to such resolution but need not be published as part of the resolution. For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such publication any person in interest may file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to contest the regularity, formality or legality of the proceedings authorizing the revenue bonds, or the legality of such resolution and its provisions or of the revenue bonds to be issued pursuant thereto and the provisions securing the revenue bonds. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period no one shall have any right of action to contest the validity of the revenue bonds or of such proceedings or of such resolution or the validity of the pledges and covenants made in such proceedings and resolution and the revenue bonds and the provisions for their payment shall be conclusively presumed to be legal and no court shall thereafter have authority to inquire into such matters.

     <p>
      The principal of, and interest and premiums, if any, on any revenue bonds issued hereunder shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues and receipts out of which the same shall be made payable and may also be payable out of proceeds from the sale of the pollution control facility acquired with proceeds of such revenue bonds, but shall not be secured by the full faith and credit or the taxing power of the state of Idaho or of any political subdivision thereof. The resolution under which the revenue bonds are authorized to be issued and any indenture executed as security for the revenue bonds, may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the properties covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portions thereof leased by the county to others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, including the designation of a trustee, which may be a bank or trust company, the principal place of business of which may be within or without the state of Idaho, all as the board shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. Each pledge and agreement made for the benefit or security of any of the revenue bonds issued hereunder shall continue effective until the principal of, and interest and premiums, if any, on the revenue bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid or provision for such payment duly made. In the event of default in such payment or in any agreements of the county made as a part of the contract under which the revenue bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the revenue bonds or in any indenture executed as security therefor, said payment or agreement may be enforced by suit, mandamus or the appointment of a receiver in equity, or any one (1) or more of said remedies.

      Revenue bonds passed under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any political subdivision, but shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided therefor. The issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall not, directly or indirectly or contingently, obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy any form of taxation therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment.

Neither the state nor the county authorizing the issuance thereof shall in any event be liable for the payment of the principal or of interest or premiums, if any, on any such revenue bonds. No breach of any such pledge, obligation or agreement may impose any pecuniary liability upon the state or the county authorizing the issuance thereof or any charge upon their general credit or against their taxing power.

     <p>
      Neither this chapter nor anything herein contained shall be construed as a restriction or limitation upon any powers which any county might otherwise have under any laws of this state, but shall be construed as cumulative of any such powers. No proceedings, notice or approval shall be required for the issuance of any revenue bonds or any instrument as security therefor, except that no revenue bonds shall be issued hereunder until the board shall by resolution adopted by a majority of the board determine that the interest of the county and the public interest or necessity demand the acquisition, construction, installation and equipment of pollution control facilities to be financed for or to be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of to persons, associations or corporations other than municipal corporations or other political subdivisions, whereupon the board shall order the submission of the proposition of issuing such revenue bonds for the purposes set forth in said resolution to the vote of the qualified electors of the county as defined in section 34-104, Idaho Code, at an election to be held subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code. The declaration of public interest or necessity herein required and the provision for the holding of such election may be included within one and the same resolution, which resolution, in addition to such declaration of public interest or necessity, shall recite the objects and purposes for which the revenue bonds are proposed to be issued, the amount of principal of the revenue bonds, and the source of revenues pledged to the payment of said bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such resolution shall also fix the date upon which such election shall be held, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, the manner of holding the same, which shall be in accordance with the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code, and the method of voting for or against the issuance of the revenue bonds. Such resolution shall designate the precincts and polling places. The county clerk shall appoint for each polling place, from each precinct from the electors thereof, the officers of such election, one (1) of whom shall act as clerk, who shall constitute a board of election for each polling place. The description of precincts may be made by reference to any order or orders of the board, or by reference to any previous order or resolution of the board or by detailed description of such precincts. Precincts established by the board may be consolidated for elections held hereunder. A notice of election shall be published by the county clerk once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, the first publication shall be not less than twelve (12) days prior to the election, and the last publication of which shall be at least five (5) days prior to the date set for said election, in the newspaper of general circulation within the county in which legal notices of the county are customarily published, and no other or further notice of such election or publication of the names of election officers or of the precincts or polling places need be given or made.
    The county clerk shall conduct the election in the manner prescribed by law for the holding of county elections to the extent the same shall apply. The returns thereof shall be canvassed and the results thereof declared as provided in chapter 12, title 34, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that it shall appear from said returns that a majority of the qualified electors of the county who shall have voted on any proposition submitted hereunder at such election voted in favor of such proposition, the county shall thereupon be authorized to issue and sell such revenue bonds of the county, all for the purpose or purposes and object or objects provided for in the proposition submitted hereunder and in the resolution therefor, and in the amount so provided.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature recognizes that the counties of the state perform vital functions in administering and delivering law enforcement services to all residents of the state. The legislature further finds it is necessary that the boards of county commissioners of the counties of the state be able to address the needs of county-provided components of the justice system by funding them at levels which do not compromise the performance of the justice system as a whole and which advance the interests of the public, while protecting the rights of individuals involved with the justice system.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners of any county may, in conjunction with development of their annual budget, by resolution adopted at a public meeting of the board, establish a county justice fund to provide funding for the operation of the county sheriff’s office, construction, remodeling, operation and maintenance of county jails, juvenile detention facilities and/or county courthouses, operation of the prosecuting attorney’s office, provision of public defender service and otherwise court-appointed counsel, and operation of the office of the clerk of the district court, to the extent that operation of that office provides support for the district court. The justice fund shall be separate and distinct from the county current expense fund and expenditures from the justice fund shall be solely dedicated to the purposes set forth in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the discretion of the board of county commissioners, funds deposited in the county justice fund may be allowed to accumulate over a period of years for designated capital improvements or be expended on a regular basis.

       If a board of county commissioners desires to establish a county justice fund, it shall publish notice of intent to do so in conjunction with the proposed budget publication required in section 31-1604, Idaho Code, and shall depict such proposal in the proposed county budget in a manner consistent with the provisions of section 31-1603, Idaho Code.

       Establishment of a county justice fund shall proportionately reduce the allowable property tax charges for remaining expenses in the county current expense fund. For purposes of achieving a proportionate reduction, the following procedure shall be followed:

         Prior to the September budget hearing required by section 31-1604, Idaho Code, and upon the request of the board of county commissioners, the budget officer shall identify and separate the appropriations for the services and operations outlined in section 31-4602, Idaho Code, from the previous year’s budget, including estimated portions of the general reserve appropriation and court-ordered expenditures for such purposes. Such figure, and the percentage that such figure constitutes of the whole of the current expense fund expenditures, shall be certified by the clerk of the county and shall be transmitted to the board of county commissioners.

If the board of county commissioners believes the previous year’s budget is not typical, it may petition the state tax commission for an administrative ruling setting the percentage of justice fund expenditures based upon a more extended history of such budgeted expenditures.

The product of this multiplication shall be subtracted from the entire property tax charge for the current expense fund and shall constitute the justice fund allocation. The remainder, after the justice fund allocation has been subtracted, shall constitute a new property tax base for the current expense fund. Allowable property tax charges for the current expense fund in the year the justice fund is created shall be determined upon the base established in this section. In subsequent years, after a county has established a justice fund, the maximum levy authority for the current expense fund shall be twenty hundredths percent (.20%) of market value for assessment purposes as provided for in section 63-805, Idaho Code.

      § 31-4706. Budget of funds for county museum purposes — Maintenance of idle property.
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of determining what funds must be raised by taxes for county museum purposes, the county museum board shall meet at such time as may be provided by law for the preparation of budgets, and shall make a budget of the amounts required for museum purposes, including all salaries to be paid for the current year, and shall deduct therefrom any balance remaining in its treasury, and shall then certify to the board of county commissioners the amount of said budget. The board of county commissioners may make a levy upon all taxable property in the county in the amount requested by the county museum budget. No levy for the purposes of this chapter shall exceed three-hundredths percent (.03%) on each dollar of market value for assessment purposes of taxable property in the county. When such taxes have been collected, the same shall be paid to the treasurer of the county museum board to be used for the purposes authorized by this chapter. Upon the creation and appointment of the museum board by the county commissioners, it hereby becomes a taxing unit separate and distinct from any other taxing unit or tax levy within the county under the provisions of the Idaho budget law and as such is empowered to issue tax anticipation notes or warrants as provided by law for maintaining, carrying on, conducting, payment of obligations and all other necessary expenses, incurred or to be incurred in maintaining a museum. It may be the duty of the county commissioners of any county, where property for county museum purposes is located, to levy an amount sufficient to maintain and protect such museum grounds and property.

    The 1996 amendment, by ch. 208, § 6, in the next-to-last sentence, deleted “, and the district’s first levy shall be subject to the provisions of section 63-2220(1)(iii), Idaho Code, ” following “within the county”.

        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 322, § 18, in the former language in the middle of the next-to-last sentence, see above, substituted “section 63-802(1)(c)” for “section 63-2220(1)(iii)”.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature recognizes that providing consolidated emergency communications systems and interoperable public safety communications and data systems is vital in enhancing the public health, safety, and welfare of the people in the state of Idaho. The legislature further finds that there is an obvious need for providing a means to finance the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of interoperable and consolidated emergency communications systems.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol11">
       The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol11a">
         Since the original enactment of the emergency communications act in 1988, many of Idaho’s communities have found that they are lacking in the resources to fully fund emergency communications systems at the local level;
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol11b">
         Changes in technology and the rapid growth of communications media have demonstrated that financing such systems solely by a line charge on subscribers to wireline services does not reflect utilization of emergency communications systems by subscribers to wireless and other forms of communications systems;
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol11c">
         There is a need to enhance funding for the initiation and enhancement of consolidated emergency communications systems throughout the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol11d">
         Utilization of cellular telephones and voice over internet protocol (VoIP) communications to access emergency communications systems has substantially increased citizen access to emergency services while at the same time increasing demands upon the emergency response system;
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol11e">
         In order to protect and promote the public health and safety, and to keep pace with advances in telecommunications technology and the various choices of telecommunications technology available to the public, there is a need to plan and develop a statewide coordinated policy and program to ensure that enhanced 911 services, next generation 911 services, and future and emerging public safety technologies are available to all citizens of the state and people in all areas of the state.
        </li>
       </ol>

       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol12a">
         Provide authority to counties and 911 service areas to impose an emergency communications fee on the use of telephone lines, wireless, VoIP or other communications services that connect an individual or entity dialing or accessing 911 to an established public safety answering point;
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol12b">
         Provide that the emergency communications fee in section 31-4803, Idaho Code, shall be exclusively utilized by the counties or 911 service areas electing to impose it to finance the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of consolidated emergency systems as well as enhanced consolidated emergency systems or next generation consolidated emergency systems;
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4801ol12c">
         Provide for the agreed-to reimbursement to telecommunications providers for their implementation of enhanced consolidated emergency communications systems by counties or 911 service areas that have implemented enhanced consolidated emergency communications systems;
    (d) Create the Idaho public safety communications commission that will have the duty to provide the governance structure through which public safety communications stakeholders can collaborate to advance consistency and common objectives, to provide integrated facilitation and coordination for cross-jurisdictional consensus building, to assist in the standardization of agreements for sharing resources among jurisdictions with emergency response communications infrastructure, to suggest best practices, performance measures and performance evaluation in the integrated statewide strategic planning and implementation of interoperability among public safety communications professionals and entities that serve people in Idaho regardless of jurisdiction, to manage the Idaho public safety interoperable communications and data systems fund as established by section 31-4820, Idaho Code, and to pursue budget authorizations as set forth in this chapter.

       The board of commissioners of any county may establish a consolidated emergency communications system by virtue of authority granted by this chapter or by chapter 23, title 67, Idaho Code. The service area may be regional, multicounty, countywide, or any part or parts of the county, and may include or exclude a city or cities. If the board of county commissioners has adopted a resolution stating that the county is unable to establish a countywide consolidated emergency communications system, or if the voters reject a countywide consolidated 911 system, then a 911 service area may be established by action of any city or cities within the county. The 911 service area shall be described in the ordinance of creation. The ordinance shall further provide for an election on the question as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The ordinance of creation shall define the governing board, designate the administrator, and the agency to service the 911 calls. The costs of the election ordered by the county shall be a proper charge against the county current expense fund. The costs of the election for a 911 service area shall be a proper charge against the city or cities initiating the election.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c48s31-4803ol12">
       The voters of any county or 911 service area may authorize funding to support implementation of a consolidated emergency communications system pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The authorization to provide such funding must be made by the registered voters of the county or of the 911 service area at either a primary or general election. A notice for any election shall be published for twenty (20) days as required by section 60-109, Idaho Code. A sixty percent (60%) majority of the votes cast in favor of the question shall be necessary to authorize the emergency communications fee.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c48s31-4803ol13">
       If a 911 system is to be financed in whole or in part by an emergency communications fee, the governing board shall submit the question to the electors of the county or 911 service area in substantially the following form:
      </li>
      <li id="t31c48s31-4803ol14">
       No emergency communications fee for a consolidated emergency communications system shall be charged without voter approval as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

       Any net savings in operating expenditures realized by any taxing district utilizing a consolidated emergency communications system shall be used by that taxing district for a reduction in the property tax charges of that taxing district.
      </li>

       If the voters of any county or 911 service area have previously approved funding of a consolidated emergency communications system in the manner provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, no further vote is necessary to authorize the emergency communications fee set forth in this act.
    (7) Effective October 1, 2004, and every year thereafter, the emergency communications fee provided for in this act shall be reviewed and modified as required by this subsection by the board of commissioners of a countywide system or by the governing board of a 911 service area as follows:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t31c48s31-4803ol16a">
         The level of the emergency communications fee shall be reviewed and, as appropriate and necessary, readjusted by action of the board of commissioners or the governing board on an annual basis. The board of commissioners or governing board shall set the level of the fee based upon the revenue requirements necessary to implement an annual budget prepared under the direction of the board of commissioners or governing board for the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of a consolidated emergency communications system, including both basic and, if applicable, enhanced consolidated emergency systems.
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4803ol16b">
         The revenues from emergency communications fees shall be exclusively expended pursuant to the budget established in paragraph (a) of this subsection. Use of such revenues for any other purpose is expressly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li id="t31c48s31-4803ol16c">
         The process of reviewing and setting the level of emergency communications fees shall be governed by the meeting and public notice provisions of section 31-710(4), Idaho Code. For the purposes of this section, the setting of a fee shall be deemed to be the promulgation of a rule such that public participation provisions of section 67-5222, Idaho Code, shall apply to the meetings of the board of commissioners or of a governing board pursuant to this section.

       (5) Use of fees. The emergency communications fee provided hereunder shall be used only to pay for the lease, purchase or maintenance of emergency communications equipment for basic and enhanced consolidated emergency systems, and next generation consolidated emergency systems (NG911), including necessary computer hardware, software, database provisioning, training, salaries directly related to such systems, costs of establishing such systems, management, maintenance and operation of hardware and software applications and agreed-to reimbursement costs of telecommunications providers related to the operation of such systems. Use of the emergency communications fee should, if possible, coincide with the strategic goals as identified by the Idaho public safety communications commission in its annual report to the legislature. However, the county or 911 service area governing board has final authority on lawful expenditures. All other expenditures necessary to operate such systems and other normal and necessary safety or law enforcement functions including, but not limited to, those expenditures related to overhead, staffing, dispatching, administrative and other day-to-day operational expenditures, shall continue to be paid through the general funding of the respective governing boards; provided however, that any governing body using the emergency communications fee to pay the salaries of dispatchers as of March 1, 2006, may continue to do so until the beginning of such governing body’s 2007 fiscal year.

      A district shall have power to issue bonds or other obligations including, without limitation, installment purchase or lease-purchase obligations, from time to time in the discretion of the district board, for any of its corporate purposes. A district shall also have power to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying or retiring bonds previously issued or other indebtedness previously incurred by it. In order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, a district may issue, upon proper resolution, bonds or other obligations on which the principal and interest are payable (a) exclusively from the income and revenue of a project financed with the proceeds of such bonds or other obligations; or (b) exclusively from such income and revenues together with grants and contributions from the federal government or other moneys of the district or any source in aid of such project.
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither the members of the district board nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds or other obligations by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of a district (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt or liability, direct or indirect, of the district, the state, or any political subdivision thereof, and neither the district, the state, nor any political subdivision thereof shall be liable thereon, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds other than those of the district. Bonds of a district are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose, and the interest thereon shall be exempt from income taxation by the state of Idaho.
