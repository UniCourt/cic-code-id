        The legislature did not intend for parental consent statute to apply to adult adoptions. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1-1622, which requires the court to adopt any suitable process or mode of process which appears most comfortable to the spirit of the code, is not applicable to permit the court to establish the procedure for adult adoption; this is an area which is entirely statutory and should be established by the legislature. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the only statutory reference to a procedure for adult adoptions is found in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>, presumably the legislature only intended that adult adoptions be addressed and provided for under this section; however, it did not provide the procedure for such adoption. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        While this section does permit adoptions of an adult by another adult, there is no procedure set forth by which to effectuate an adult adoption; therefore, stepfather could not adopt 18-year-old stepdaughter. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>).

        Magistrate court erred in dismissing an adoption petition filed by the long-time partner of the children’s biological mother because (1) the magistrate violated the partner’s due process rights, when it dismissed her adoption petition without affording her the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner; (2) by not holding a hearing, the magistrate court acted contrary to Idaho’s adoption statutes; and (3) the adoption statutes unambiguously allow a second, prospective parent to adopt, regardless of marital status, and the statutory scheme contained no provisions that limited adoption to those who are married.

        By using the term “persons not minors” in this section, the legislature clearly made a distinction between a minor child and an adult child; thus, when the adoption statutes refer to “children” or “child” they are referring to a person who is not eighteen years old; therefore, there is no indication the legislature intended the parental consent statute to apply to an adult adoption. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>).

         An unmarried mother, faced with the responsibility of making crucial decisions about the future of a newborn child, is entitled to privacy, and has the right to make timely and appropriate decisions regarding her future and the future of the child, and is entitled to assurance regarding the permanence of an adoptive placement;

         An unmarried biological father has an inchoate interest that acquires constitutional protection only when he demonstrates a timely and full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood, both during pregnancy and upon the child’s birth. The state has a compelling interest in requiring unmarried biological fathers to demonstrate that commitment by providing appropriate medical care and financial support and by establishing legal paternity, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

         If an unmarried biological father fails to grasp the opportunities to establish a relationship with his child that are available to him, his biological parental interest may be lost entirely, or greatly diminished in constitutional significance by his failure to timely exercise it, or by his failure to strictly comply with the available legal steps to substantiate it.

         A certain degree of finality is necessary in order to facilitate the state’s compelling interest. The legislature finds that the interest of the state, the mother, the child, and the adoptive parents described in this section outweigh the interest of an unmarried biological father who does not timely grasp the opportunity to establish and demonstrate a relationship with his child in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

        By using the term “persons not minors” in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1501" target="_self">§ 16-1501</a></cite>, the legislature clearly made a distinction between a minor child and an adult child; thus, when the adoption statutes refer to “children” or “child” they are referring to a person who is not eighteen years old; therefore, there is no indication the legislature intended the parental consent statute to apply to an adult adoption.

        The mere failure of the parents of a minor child, in the custody and under the care of a third party, to contribute, while it is in such custody and care, to the support and maintenance of such child for a period of one year does not itself constitute an abandonment of the minor within the purview of this section.

        The legislature did not intend for parental consent statute to apply to adult adoptions. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>).
    By using the term “persons not minors” in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1501" target="_self">§ 16-1501</a></cite>, the legislature clearly made a distinction between a minor child and an adult child; thus, when the adoption statutes refer to “children” or “child” they are referring to a person who is not eighteen years old; therefore, there is no indication the legislature intended the parental consent statute to apply to an adult adoption. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1506" target="_self">§ 16-1506</a></cite>).

        Because a grandmother, and legal guardian, did not consent in writing to her former girlfriend’s adoption of her granddaughters, the magistrate court properly dismissed the petition for co-adoption.

        Summary judgment was properly awarded to the Idaho department of health and welfare on grandparents’ petition to adopt a child because the grandparents could not adopt the child without written consent from the department regardless of what facts they presented; the department had stated that it would not consent to the adoption.

        Although the natural mother not only consented to the payment of her legal fees by the adopting parents, but undoubtedly insisted upon it, there was no evidence in the record that the attorney allowed the adopting parents to regulate his professional judgment in rendering services to the natural mother; therefore, the natural mother’s consent to adoption was executed without fraud, duress, or undue influence.

        Loss of right of consent of natural father to adoption of child by virtue of his failure to keep up support orders pursuant to divorce decree is a matter for determination by probate court. Wilson v. Wilson, 73 Idaho 326, 252 P.2d 197 (1953).
    Court determined that biological father had no cognizable parental rights, and, thus, his consent to adoption was not required; where he had not had his paternity established by court decree, he had never filed an acknowledgement of paternity with vital statistics, he had not filed an acknowledgement of paternity, commenced paternity proceedings, or provided any monetary support toward the mother’s pregnancy, he was clearly aware of the strong possibility that he was the child’s father, particularly when the child was born nine months after he had engaged in sexual relations with the mother, and he had done nothing to affirmatively establish a relationship with the child.

        In order to make order of adoption valid without consent of parents, it must appear in record that case comes within some of exceptions mentioned in this statute. Parent is not judicially deprived of his child’s custody except by a final, absolute and unconditional judgment. Jain v. Priest, 30 Idaho 273, 164 P. 364 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Adoption without personal appearance of qualified parent cannot be sustained unless record of adoption proceeding affirmatively shows that such parent was not a resident of, and was not within, county of residence of adopting person. Vaughan v. Hubbard, 38 Idaho 451, 221 P. 1107 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the divorce complaint charged both cruelty and desertion, evidence of both was presented at the trial, and the divorce decree merely decreed “that the plaintiff have judgment and decree of this court in accordance with the complaint filed herein,” there was no adjudication of cruelty so as to render consent of the defendant for adoption of her children unnecessary under this section. Leonard v. Leonard, 88 Idaho 485, 401 P.2d 541 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the divorce complaint did not charge adultery beyond such inferences as might be drawn from the allegation of cruelty in that “defendant has engaged in numerous affairs with other men” and no evidence of adultery was offered, the defendant will not be considered to have been divorced for adultery so as to render her consent to the adoption of her children unnecessary under this section. Leonard v. Leonard, 88 Idaho 485, 401 P.2d 541 (1965).

        Lack of consent by the natural parents renders an adoption decree void. In re Andersen, 99 Idaho 805, 589 P.2d 957 (1978), overruled on other grounds, DeBernardi v. Steve B.D., 111 Idaho 285, 723 P.2d 829 (1986).

       </p>
       <p>
        On conflicting evidence, the trial court’s finding that the father had abandoned his minor children so that his consent to adoption of them was unnecessary to the validity thereof, and that he was not entitled to a notice of adoption proceeding, was sustained. Finn v. Rees, 65 Idaho 181, 141 P.2d 976 (1943).

        This section does not dispense with notice to parents of a pending adoption proceeding, even when consent of such parents is unnecessary under this section. Leonard v. Leonard, 88 Idaho 485, 401 P.2d 541 (1965).

    Subsection (2)(b) did not relieve a grandmother seeking to adopt a grandchild of the duty to provide the child’s father with notice of the possible termination of the father’s parental rights, because nothing showed (1) the child had been placed for adoption, or (2) proceedings had been initiated to terminate the mother’s parental rights. Doe v. Doe, 155 Idaho 660, 315 P.3d 848 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grandmother’s petition to adopt a grandchild was insufficient notice to the child’s father of the possible termination of the father’s parental rights, because the petition did not state any grounds for seeking such termination. Doe v. Doe, 155 Idaho 660, 315 P.3d 848 (2013).

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t16c15s16-1506ol11">
       Proceedings to adopt a child shall be commenced by the filing of a petition together with a copy thereof. The petition shall be initiated by the person or persons proposing to adopt the child and shall be filed with the district court of the county in which said person or persons reside. If the adoption arises from a child protective act case, the petition shall be filed in the court having jurisdiction over the child protective act case unless that court relinquishes jurisdiction over the adoption proceeding. The petitioners shall have resided and maintained a dwelling within the state of Idaho for at least six (6) consecutive months prior to the filing of a petition. The petition shall set forth the name and address of the petitioner or petitioners, the name of the child proposed to be adopted and the name by which the person to be adopted shall be known if and when adopted, the degree of relationship of the child, if any, to the petitioner or petitioners and the names of any person or agency whose consent to said adoption is necessary. At the time fixed for hearing such petition, the person adopting a child and the child adopted, and the spouse of the petitioner if a natural parent of the child, must appear before the court of the county wherein the petition was filed. The petitioner shall at such time execute an agreement to the effect that the child shall be adopted and treated in all respects as his own lawful child should be treated.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c15s16-1506ol12">
       If the adoption arises from a child protective act case, then, in addition to the petition filed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the department of health and welfare shall file the permanency plan prepared pursuant to section 16-1620 or 16-1622, Idaho Code, associated with the child protective act case. If the court determines that the person proposing to adopt the child is not the proposed adoptive parent named in the permanency plan, then the judge shall stay the proceeding pending the department preparing and filing an amended permanency plan pursuant to section 16-1620 or 16-1622, Idaho Code, and the approval of the amended permanency plan by the judge presiding over the child protective act proceeding.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c15s16-1506ol13">
       Any person or persons whose consent is required shall execute such consent in writing, in a form consistent with the provisions of section 16-2005(4), Idaho Code, which consent being filed in the court where the application is made, shall be deemed a sufficient appearance on the part of such person or persons. If any adoptive parent, or a person not a minor being adopted by a resident adult under the provisions of section 16-1501, Idaho Code, is a member of the armed services and is unable to attend the hearing, his appearance and testimony shall be received by means of deposition, which shall be filed in the court at the time of the hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c15s16-1506ol14">
       Prior to the placement for adoption of any child in the home of prospective adoptive parents, it shall be required that a thorough social investigation of the prospective adoptive family and all of its members, consistent with the rules regarding such investigations promulgated by the department of health and welfare, shall be completed and that a positive recommendation for adoptive placement shall have been made. The social investigation may be performed by any individual who meets the requirements of the law. A copy of the study must be submitted to the department and the department may impose a reasonable fee, not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00), for oversight of such privately conducted studies. If the prospective adoptive parent has a disability as defined in this chapter, the prospective adoptive parent shall have the right, as a part of the social study, to provide information regarding the manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will enable the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child. The person performing the social investigation shall advise the prospective adoptive parent of such right and shall consider all such information in any findings or recommendations. The social investigation of any prospective adoptive parent with a disability shall be conducted by, or with the assistance of, an individual with expertise in the use of such equipment and services. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any new or additional obligation on state or local governments to purchase or provide adaptive equipment or supportive services for parents with disabilities. In those instances where the prospective adoptive parent is married to the birth parent or is the grandparent of the child to be adopted, such social investigation shall be completed with regard to the prospective adoptive parent only upon order of the court. In exigent circumstances where the prospective adoptive parents are determined by the court to have been unable to complete a social investigation of the family with a positive recommendation prior to the time the child is placed in the home, the child shall remain in the home unless the court determines the best interests of the child are served by other placement. If exigent circumstances exist, a social investigation shall be initiated within five (5) days of placement. Once initiated, all studies shall be completed within sixty (60) days. Upon the filing of a petition to adopt a minor child by a person unrelated to the child or unmarried to a natural parent of the child and at the discretion of the court upon the filing of any other petition for adoption, a copy of such petition, together with a statement containing the full names and permanent addresses of the child and the petitioners, shall be served by the court receiving the petition within five (5) days on the director of the department of health and welfare by registered mail or personal service. If no private investigation is conducted, it shall then be the duty of the said director, through the personnel of the department or through such qualified child-placing children’s adoption agency incorporated under chapter 30, title 30, Idaho Code, as the director may designate, to verify the allegations of the petition, and as soon as possible not exceeding thirty (30) days after service of the petition on the director to make a thorough investigation of the matter to include in all cases information as to the alleged date and place of birth and as to parentage of the child to be adopted as well as the source of all such information and report his findings in writing to the court. The investigative report shall include reasonably known or available medical and genetic information regarding both natural parents and sources of such information as well as reasonably known or available providers of medical care and services to the natural parents. A copy of all medical and genetic information compiled in the investigation shall be made available to the adopting family by the department or other investigating children’s adoption agency prior to entry of the final order of adoption. The petition, statement and all other papers, records or files relating to the adoption, including the preplacement investigation and recommendation, shall be returned to the court with the investigative report. The department of health and welfare or other children’s adoption agency may require the petitioner to pay all or any part of the costs of the investigation. If the report disapproves of the adoption of the child, motion may be made to the court to dismiss the petition.
    (5) Proceedings for termination of parent-child relationship in accordance with chapter 20, title 16, Idaho Code, and proceedings for adoption may be consolidated and determined at one (1) hearing provided that all of the requirements of this chapter as well as chapter 20, title 16, Idaho Code, be fully complied with. Nothing in either chapter shall be construed as limiting the initiation of any petition for approval of a verified financial plan for adoption expenses pursuant to section 18-1511, Idaho Code, prior to the birth of the child which is the subject of any adoption proceeding. In all disputed matters under this chapter or chapter 20, title 16, Idaho Code, the paramount criterion for consideration and determination by the court shall be the best interests of the child.
    (6) Proceedings for the adoption of an adult shall be as provided in subsection (1) of this section and any consents required shall be executed as provided in subsection (3) of this section. Upon a finding by the court that the consent of all persons for whom consent is required has been given and that the requirements of section 16-1501, Idaho Code, have been proven to the satisfaction of the court, the court shall enter an order granting the adoption. In cases where the adult proposed to be adopted is incapacitated or disabled, the court may require that an investigation be performed. The form and extent of the investigation to be undertaken may be as provided in subsection (4) of this section, or as otherwise ordered by the court. If an investigation is performed, the court must review and approve the findings of the investigation before issuing an order approving the adoption.

        The legislature did not intend for parental consent statute to apply to adult adoptions. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment of this section).
       </p>
       <p>
        By using the term “persons not minors” in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1501" target="_self">§ 16-1501</a></cite>, the legislature clearly made a distinction between a minor child and an adult child; thus, when the adoption statutes refer to “children” or “child” they are referring to a person who is not eighteen years old; therefore, there is no indication the legislature intended the parental consent statute to apply to an adult adoption. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment of this section).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1-1622, which requires the court to adopt any suitable process or mode of process which appears most comfortable to the spirit of the code, is not applicable to permit the court to establish the procedure for adult adoption; this is an area which is entirely statutory and should be established by the legislature. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment of this section).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature only intended that adult adoptions be addressed and provided for under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1501" target="_self">§ 16-1501</a></cite>; however, it did not provide the procedure for such adoption. Melling v. Chaney, 126 Idaho 554, 887 P.2d 1061 (1994) (see 1996 amendment of this section).

        Pursiant to subsection (6), a biological mother’s consent is required for the adoption of a cognitively impaired adult son by his step-mother; and, to be given a chance to consent, the biological mother is entitled to notice of the adoption proceeding.

       <p>
        The rule is that an attempted adoption of a minor child by its mother and her second husband without the consent of the natural father from whom the mother was granted a divorce for cruelty and by decree awarded the custody of the minor child with reservations of certain rights to the father is void; therefore, such a judgment may be attacked by the father either directly or collaterally. Smith v. Smith, 67 Idaho 349, 180 P.2d 853 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Loss of right of consent of natural father to adoption of child by virtue of his failure to keep up support orders pursuant to divorce decree is a matter for determination by probate court. Wilson v. Wilson, 73 Idaho 326, 252 P.2d 197 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the natural mother not only consented to the payment of her legal fees by the adopting parents, but undoubtedly insisted upon it, there was no evidence in the record that the attorney allowed the adopting parents to regulate his professional judgment in rendering services to the natural mother; therefore, the natural mother’s consent to adoption was executed without fraud, duress, or undue influence. DeBernardi v. Steve B.D., 111 Idaho 285, 723 P.2d 829 (1986).
    Summary judgment was properly awarded to the Idaho department of health and welfare on grandparents’ petition to adopt a child because the grandparents could not adopt the child without written consent from the department regardless of what facts they presented; the department had stated that it would not consent to the adoption. Doe v. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare (In re Doe), 150 Idaho 491, 248 P.3d 742 (2011).

        Given that, once a parent or guardian gives consent for a specified individual to adopt a child, that consent cannot be revoked and becomes permanent, strict compliance with the requirements of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c20s16-2005" target="_self">§ 16-2005</a></cite>(4) and subsection (2) of this section is required.

        In the absence of fraud, duress, or undue influence, consents to adoption become final and irrevocable upon execution of the consent to adoption by the natural parents, and delivery and surrender of the child to the adoptive parents; the estoppel approach to an attempted revocation of a consent to adoption is overruled.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because a grandmother, and legal guardian, did not consent in writing to her former girlfriend’s adoption of her granddaughters, the magistrate court properly dismissed the petition for co-adoption. A petition for co-adoption, filed by the parties, was not sufficient written consent for an adoption. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 636, 402 P.3d 1089 (2017).

        Magistrate court erred in dismissing an adoption petition filed by the long-time partner of the children’s biological mother because (1) the magistrate violated the partner’s due process rights, when it dismissed her adoption petition without affording her the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner; (2) by not holding a hearing, the magistrate court acted contrary to Idaho’s adoption statutes; and (3) the adoption statutes unambiguously allow a second, prospective parent to adopt, regardless of marital status, and the statutory scheme contained no provisions that limited adoption to those who are married.

      § 16-1509A. Dissolution of adoption.
     </h3>
     <p>
      An adoption may be dissolved, upon petition, with the agreement of both the adoptee and the adopting parent, when the adopting parent was the spouse of a natural parent, and the marriage of the natural parent and adoptive parent was terminated. If the petition for dissolution occurs after the death of the adoptive parent, the court shall, in the finding of dissolution, specify the effect upon rights of inheritance. The court must determine that avoidance of statutory care is not the purpose of the dissolution, unless the court finds grounds to waive this finding. An action to obtain a decree of dissolution of adoption may be commenced at any time after the adoptee reaches twenty-one (21) years of age.

       A person who is the father or claims to be the father of a child born out of wedlock may claim rights pertaining to his paternity of the child by commencing proceedings to establish paternity under section 7-1111, Idaho Code, and by filing with the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare notice of his filing of proceedings to establish his paternity of the child born out of wedlock. The vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare shall provide forms for the purpose of filing the notice of filing of paternity proceedings, and the forms shall be made available through the vital statistics unit of the Idaho department of health and welfare and in the office of the county clerk in every county of this state. The forms shall include a written notification that filing pursuant to this section shall not satisfy the requirements of chapter 82, title 39, Idaho Code, and the notification shall also include the following statements:

        It was error to terminate a biological father’s parental rights based on his failure to file and register his notice of commencement of paternity proceedings under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1513" target="_self">§ 16-1513</a></cite>, because the father and mother had filled out and had notarized a paternity affidavit requesting that he be listed as the father on the child’s birth certificate; it was, therefore, unnecessary for him to file a paternity action; he was the biological father of the child and, pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c20s16-2007" target="_self">§ 16-2007</a></cite>, he was entitled to have had notice of the termination hearing.

        Where putative father never commenced paternity proceedings before the department of health and welfare petitioned to terminate mother’s parental rights, the magistrate judge correctly held that father was not even entitled to notice of a hearing on a petition by the department requesting an Order of Non-Establishment of Parental Rights. The magistrate’s decision is reversible only if father can show that his due process rights were violated. Doe v. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 36, 304 P.3d 1202 (2013) (see 2014 amendment).

A visa or other document from the United States department of state or United States department of homeland security authorizing entry into the United States for the purpose of adoption, or for humanitarian reasons relating to adoption by United States citizens, shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the termination of the parental rights of the biological parents and compliance with the laws of the country of the child’s birth. The provisions of chapter 20, title 16, Idaho Code, shall not apply to adoptions under this section.
    (4) The decisions and orders of foreign courts and government agencies, authorized to approve adoptions, shall be accorded judicial comity or the same full faith and credit accorded a judgment of a sister state without additional proceedings or documentation, provided the United States department of state or United States department of homeland security has allowed the child to enter the United States as set forth in subsection (3) of this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The policy of the state of Idaho is hereby declared to be the establishment of a legal framework conducive to the judicial processing, including periodic review of child abuse, abandonment and neglect cases, and the protection of any child whose life, health or welfare is endangered. At all times, the health and safety of the child shall be the primary concern. Each child coming within the purview of this chapter shall receive, preferably in his own home, the care, guidance and control that will promote his welfare and the best interest of the state of Idaho, and if he is removed from the control of one (1) or more of his parents, guardian or other custodian, the state shall secure adequate care for him; provided, however, that the state of Idaho shall, to the fullest extent possible, seek to preserve, protect, enhance and reunite the family relationship. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow discrimination on the basis of disability. This chapter seeks to coordinate efforts by state and local public agencies, in cooperation with private agencies and organizations, citizens’ groups, and concerned individuals, to:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t16c16s16-1601ol11">

      </li>
      <li id="t16c16s16-1601ol13">
       Take such actions as may be necessary to provide the child with permanency including concurrent planning;

        The standard for state intervention for the medical treatment of children is that intervention is authorized when children are threatened by, or are in, actual harm. The rules of the department of health and welfare regarding the handling of child abuse, neglect and abandonment are neutral toward religious beliefs; the investigation of child abuse and neglect will proceed and determination of neglect will be made based upon the threat of harm to the child, not upon the religious beliefs of the parents.

        Although the parents provided an explanation for the older child’s injuries, the magistrate was free to determine that the parents’ explanation did not justifiably explain the child’s injuries in light of the testimony regarding her injuries and the photographic evidence depicting them. Thus, there was sufficient evidence presented allowing the magistrate to find that the child was abused and within the court’s jurisdiction. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v.

       <p>
        Mother’s failure to stop using methamphetamine, her continued association with known drug users, her continuing lack of employment, and her failure to comply with her case plan were sufficient evidence supporting the finding that she had neglected the child, as defined this section.

        Trial court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights, because there was substantial evidence that he neglected his children. After his release from prison, he failed to establish suitable living arrangements, failed to obtain adequate employment, and was convicted of driving without privileges. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 151 Idaho 498, 260 P.3d 1169 (2011).
       </p>

        In terminating a father’s parental rights, evidence of his failure to comply with his case plan was properly considered as a basis for neglect. Ida. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 151 Idaho 356, 256 P.3d 764 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because subdivisions (25) [now (31)] (a) and (b) of this section are written in the disjunctive, there is no requirement that a magistrate court consider the statutory timeframe in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c16s16-1629" target="_self">§ 16-1629</a></cite>(9) when it is making a finding of neglect based on subdivision (25)(a) [now (31)(a)] of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of mother’s parental rights by a finding that she neglected her children was justified, where she neither completed the drug treatment programs mandated by her case plan, nor did she timely seek help with her anger management, also as required by the case plan.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights under paragraph (25)(a) [now (31)(a)], because he neglected his child by conduct or omission, which caused the child to be without proper parental care and control, subsistence, medical, or other care or control. The father had not expressed a genuine interest in learning about the child’s special needs, let alone how to care for those needs on a daily basis. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 152 Idaho 644, 273 P.3d 685 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, the magistrate court found that appellant mother neglected her children, because they were without proper parental care and control, proper subsistence, and the medical and other care necessary for their well-being. In re Doe, 152 Idaho 910, 277 P.3d 357 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother failed to show that the trial court erred in finding neglect; in part, the mother failed to get her children to school and counseling sessions and did not provide financial support; and, it was hard to find any area of parental responsibility that the mother consistently met. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 156 Idaho 103, 320 P.3d 1262 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Willfulness is not necessary to a finding of neglect, as father’s incarceration, long history of addiction and failed treatment, and failure to maintain stable housing or employment were properly considered in determining that he had neglected his child. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 158 Idaho 764, 351 P.3d 1222 (2015).
    There was substantial evidence to support the termination of a father’s parental rights based on neglect and abuse. He failed to provide for the well-being of his children, as he did not complete counseling services, did not actively participate in parenting classes, and did not intervene when his children were being abused by his spouse. Further, the father’s inability to discharge parental responsibilities had been ongoing for years. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 159 Idaho 664, 365 P.3d 420 (Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to her children, because clear and convincing evidence established that she abandoned the children by failing to maintain a normal parental relationship and neglected them by failing to provide meaningful support where she had some financial ability to do so, had a difficult time keeping a job and permanent residence, and did not provide any resources to help the children, cover expenses of any kind or cover the cost of keeping the children while they were in the care of their paternal great-grandparents. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 161 Idaho 532, 387 P.3d 785 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper on the basis of neglect because, despite the mother’s recent progress, she had longstanding history of drug abuse and relapses and neglectful conduct: one of the children was seriously injured in an automobile accident due to the mother driving while under the influence; she used drugs while pregnant or while the children were in her care; she had failed to provide stable and safe housing for her children; and she was not a consistent presence in the children’s lives, as she had been absent because of drug usage, because the care of the children was overwhelming to her, and because of incarceration. Idaho Dep’t of Health v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 162 Idaho 69, 394 P.3d 112 (Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s decision to terminate a father’s parental rights based on neglect was supported by substantial and competent evidence, because the father neglected his child, provided no excuse for failing to provide financial support, and provided no explanation for his failure to try to make efforts to visit with his child or to return to the court to enforce the order allowing him visitation. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 653, 402 P.3d 1106 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s finding that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests based on neglect was supported by substantial, competent evidence, where the mother was unable to provide a stable and permanent home for child; there was ample evidence that the child improved under foster care, and the mother demonstrated a consistent inability to care for the child. Idaho Dep’t. of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 163 Idaho 274, 411 P.3d 1175 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights, based on neglect and the child’s best interest, because there was no reason to make the child wait for a permanency hearing where nothing was going to change significantly, due to the mother’s lack of progress and failure to comply with the case plan, her chronic and untreated substance abuse, and her mental health concerns which impaired her ability to provide a stable, consistent home for the child. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 164 Idaho 143, 426 P.3d 1243 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s finding that the mother neglected her children, including evidence that the mother and eldest child both tested positive for methamphetamine, the mother had 15 months to obtain a stable house and employment, but obtained neither, and the mother had been in and out of jail during the 15 months she was given to work on her case plan. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 486, 432 P.3d 35 (2018).
    Magistrate court’s finding of neglect based solely on a mother’s non-completion of drug treatment was supported by substantial and competent evidence. The magistrate court could properly find that the mother lacked proper parental care and control, or subsistence, medical or other care or control necessary for her child’s well-being, because of the conduct or omission of the mother in failing to complete drug treatment. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 849, 436 P.3d 670 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on neglect was proper because, although the mother challenged the magistrate court’s finding of neglect based on her failure to complete her case plan, the mother did not challenge the additional bases upon which the magistrate court found the mother neglected the child; and the court found neglect on the additional bases of the mother’s continued methamphetamine use, periods of incarceration, and probation violations. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 437 P.3d 922 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err in determining that the mother neglected a child, where the finding was based upon the developmental delays shown in the child and his malnourishment that occurred between his first and second placements in foster care. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1162 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s finding that a father neglected his children, as defined by this section, where the child was born prematurely due to being prenatally exposed to methamphetamine, the mother testified that she and the father had used methamphetamine for years, and the father had exhibited violence and had pending criminal charges for felony grand theft and several misdemeanors, including injury to a child, possession of a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia at the time of the hearing. State v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1140 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s finding that the mother neglected her children, where she was not able to maintain stable housing or employment at any point leading up to the termination hearing, and at trial she testified that she was unemployed and relying on the father’s income for support. State v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1151 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights, because she had a drug addition, had left on a trip to California, had been incarcerated, and was unable to provide a safe and stable home for the child based on her spotty employment and housing history. The child’s best interests and need for stability could not wait for the mother to finish her case plan or have the time that she needed to devote to the child. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (2019-32) (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 457 P.3d 154 (2020).

        Medical Treatment.

        Neither the express language of Idaho’s religious exemption nor traditional constitutional principles of religious freedom limit administrative or judicial authority to provide medical services to children.<cite class="OAG">OAG 93-9</cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard for state intervention for the medical treatment of children is that intervention is authorized when children are threatened by, or are in, actual harm. The rules of the department of health and welfare regarding the handling of child abuse, neglect and abandonment are neutral toward religious beliefs; the investigation of child abuse and neglect will proceed and determination of neglect will be made based upon the threat of harm to the child, not upon the religious beliefs of the parents.<cite class="OAG">OAG 93-9</cite>.

        Bad Faith or Malice.

       <p>
        The question of whether a person makes a report or allegation of child abuse knowing it to be false or reports in bad faith or with malice is to be tried to a court rather than a jury. Davidson v. Davidson, 150 Idaho 455, 248 P.3d 242 (Ct. App. 2011).

        Summary Judgment.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The traditional summary judgment standard applies in the context of liability of persons reporting instances of suspected child abuse. Thus, where the substance of some of the allegations of child abuse to the department, as well as the timing of those reports, raises genuine issues of material fact regarding the reporter’s motivation, summary judgment should not be granted. Davidson v. Davidson, 150 Idaho 455, 248 P.3d 242 (Ct. App. 2011).

     <p>
      Any person who makes a report or allegation of child abuse, abandonment or neglect knowing the same to be false or who reports or alleges the same in bad faith or with malice shall be liable to the party or parties against whom the report was made for the amount of actual damages sustained or statutory damages of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), whichever is greater, plus attorney’s fees and costs of suit.

         After a petition has been filed, the clerk of the court may issue a summons requiring the person or persons who have custody of the child to bring the child before the court at the adjudicatory hearing held in accordance with section 16-1619, Idaho Code. Each parent or guardian shall also be notified in the manner hereinafter provided of the pendency of the case and the time and place set for the hearing. A summons shall be issued and served requiring the appearance of each parent and legal guardian, and a summons may be issued and served for any other person whose presence is required by the child, either of his parents or guardian or any other person whose presence, in the opinion of the court, is necessary.

The order to remove the child shall specifically state that continuation in the present condition or surroundings is contrary to the welfare of the child and shall require a peace officer or other suitable person to take the child at once to a place of shelter care designated by the authorized agency which shall provide shelter care for the child.

       The prosecuting attorney in each county shall be responsible for the development of an interagency multidisciplinary team or teams for investigation of child abuse and neglect referrals within each county. The teams shall consist of, but not be limited to, law enforcement personnel, department of health and welfare child protection risk assessment staff, child advocacy center staff where such staff is available in the county, a representative of the prosecuting attorney’s office, and any other person deemed to be necessary due to his or her special training in child abuse investigation. Other persons may participate in investigation of particular cases at the invitation of the team and as determined necessary, such as medical personnel, school officials, mental health workers, personnel from domestic violence programs, persons knowledgeable about adaptive equipment and supportive services for parents or guardians with disabilities or the guardian ad litem program.

       The teams shall develop a written protocol for investigation of child abuse cases and for interviewing alleged victims of such abuse or neglect, including protocols for investigations involving a family member with a disability. Each team shall develop written agreements signed by member agencies, specifying the role of each agency, procedures to be followed to assess risks to the child and criteria and procedures to be followed to ensure the child victim’s safety including removal of the alleged offender.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16s16-1617ol13">
       Each team member shall be trained in his or her respective role, including risk assessment, dynamics of child abuse and interviewing and investigatory techniques. Such training may be provided by the Idaho network of children’s advocacy centers or by the member’s respective agency.

      <li id="t16c16s16-1617ol15">
       Each multidisciplinary team shall develop policies that provide for an independent review of investigation procedures utilized in cases upon completion of any court actions on those cases. The procedures shall include independent citizen input. Nonoffending parents of child abuse victims shall be notified of the review procedure.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16s16-1617ol16">
       Prosecuting attorneys of the various counties may determine that multidisciplinary teams may be most effectively established through the use of joint exercise of powers agreements among more than one (1) county and such agreements are hereby authorized.

        Magistrate court correctly took custody of two children under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c16s16-1603" target="_self">§ 16-1603</a></cite>, where the son was abused by the father and the daughter lived in the same home and witnessed the father’s actions. However, the court improperly retained legal custody of the children after returning physical custody to the mother; protective supervision provided an adequate safeguard where there was no evidence that the mother was unfit.

       <p>
        Magistrate’s failure to hold a timely shelter care hearing and adjudicatory hearing and the department of health and welfare’s failure to timely disclose its investigation report were not jurisdictional issues that could be raised for the first time on appeal, did not require reversal of the magistrate’s subsequent actions, and did not operate to divest the magistrate of subject matter jurisdiction under this chapter.

       <p>
        Although the parents provided an explanation for the older child’s injuries, the magistrate was free to determine that the parents’ explanation did not justifiably explain the child’s injuries in light of the testimony regarding her injuries and the photographic evidence depicting them. Thus, there was sufficient evidence presented allowing the magistrate to find that the child was abused and within the court’s jurisdiction. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe, 150 Idaho 103, 244 P.3d 247 (Ct. App. 2010).

        Amendments.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 287, added “Finding of aggravated circumstances” in the section heading, rewrote subsections (1) through (3), and added subsections (4) through (8).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2016 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 265, added “and every twelve (12) months thereafter for as long as the court has jurisdiction” at the end of the first sentence in subsection (1); inserted “for youth age sixteen (16) years and older only” in subsection (2); in subsection (3), deleted “special” preceding “educational” in paragraph (a), in paragraph (f), substituted “Address” for “Consider” at the beginning, added the second sentence, rewrote paragraph (g), which formerly read: “In the case of a child who has attained the age of sixteen (16) years, identify the services needed to assist the child to make the transition from foster care to independent living”, and added paragraphs (h) through (j); in subsection (4), added the second sentence in the introductory paragraph and added paragraphs (a) through (c); and rewrote subsection (7), which formerly read: “If the permanency goal is not termination of parental rights and adoption or guardianship, the court may approve a permanency plan with a permanency goal of another planned permanent living arrangement only upon written case-specific findings that specify why a more permanent plan is not in the best interest of the child”.
    The 2016 amendment, by ch. 347, added paragraph (3)(h) [now (3)(k)].
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 58, redesignated the last paragraph in subsection (3) as paragraph (k), resolving a conflict caused by the multiple 2016 amendments of this section.

        Where evidence establishing existence of sexual abuse of a young child was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to accept it and to rely upon it, the trial court’s finding of abuse, based upon such evidence, could not be deemed clearly erroneous.

        Effect of Decree on Criminal Charge.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A collateral estoppel did not arise from the circumstance that the very incident which gave rise to the criminal charge for lewd conduct with a minor had earlier been the subject of a child protective act (CPA) proceeding, notwithstanding that the state was a party to the CPA proceedings which went to a final “judgment,” the findings in the CPA hearing did not bar the criminal prosecution on the charge of lewd and lascivious conduct because a conclusion as to whether a particular incident of abuse took place is not essential to the determination of the child’s best interests under the CPA and, unlike a criminal prosecution, a CPA proceeding does not have the effect of placing a defendant in jeopardy.

        In a termination of parental rights case, substantial evidence supported the finding that appellant mother neglected her children by failing to comply with her case plan that had been prepared pursuant to this section to set forth reasonable efforts that would make it possible for the children to return to appellant’s home. Appellant failed to maintain safe housing and employment as required by the case plan, did not demonstrate adequate parenting skills, and resisted her caseworkers’ suggestions for improvement.

        Magistrate did not err by finding that the Idaho department of health and welfare made reasonable efforts to reunify the mother with her children, where it developed four case plans for her, provided her with a variety of resources and support to allow her to comply with the plans, and gave her the opportunity to live at a shelter and to attend parenting counseling programs.

     <p>
      2. Why another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the youth and a compelling reason why, as of the date of the review hearing, it would not be in the best interest of the child to be placed permanently with a parent, in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in the legal custody of the department in a placement with a fit and willing relative, including an adult sibling;
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency goal for the youth; and
     </p>
     <p>
      2. There are compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the youth to be placed permanently with a parent, in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in the legal custody of the department in a placement with a fit and willing relative, including an adult sibling;
     </p>
     <p>
      1. The department shall report to the court the medication and dosage prescribed for the child, and the medical professional who prescribed the medication; and

      2. The court shall inquire as to, and may make any additional inquiry relevant to, the use of psychotropic medication; and
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) The permanency plan shall include a permanency goal. The permanency goal may be one (1) of the following: continued efforts at reunification, in the absence of a judicial determination of aggravated circumstances; or termination of parental rights and adoption, guardianship or, for youth age sixteen (16) years and older only, another planned permanent living arrangement. Every permanency plan shall include the information set forth in section 16-1621(3)(a), Idaho Code. If the permanency plan has reunification as a permanency goal, the plan shall include information set forth in section 16-1621(3)(c), Idaho Code; however, if the circumstances that caused the child to be placed into protective custody resulted in a conviction for lewd and lascivious conduct or felony injury to a child, if the child has been in protective custody for more than six (6) months, or if a high risk of repeat maltreatment or reentry into foster care exists due to a parent’s recent completion of substance abuse treatment or other compelling circumstances, then the permanency plan shall include a period of protective supervision or trial home visit period of no less than ninety (90) days prior to the court vacating the case. During the protective supervision or trial home visit period, the department shall make regular home visits. During the protective supervision or trial home visit period, the court shall hold one (1) or more review hearings for each permanency plan where a period of protective supervision or a trial home visit has been imposed and may require participation in supportive services including community home visiting and peer-to-peer mentoring. Families reunified following a period of protective supervision or a trial home visit should be encouraged by the department or the court to continue to participate in supportive services when beneficial and appropriate. If the permanency plan has a permanency goal other than reunification, the plan shall include the information set forth in section 16-1621(3)(d), Idaho Code, and, if the permanency goal is termination of parental rights and adoption, then in addition to the information set forth in section 16-1620(3), Idaho Code, the permanency plan shall also name the proposed adoptive parents when known. If the adoptive parents are not known at the time the permanency plan is prepared, then the department shall amend the plan to name the proposed adoptive parents as soon as such person or persons become known. The court may approve a permanency plan that includes a primary goal and a concurrent goal. As used in this paragraph, “trial home visit” means that a child is returned to the care of the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed with the department continuing to have legal custody of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) A permanency hearing shall be held no later than twelve (12) months from the date the child is removed from the home or the date of the court’s order taking jurisdiction under this chapter, whichever occurs first, and at least every twelve (12) months thereafter, so long as the court has jurisdiction over the child. The court shall approve, reject or modify the permanency plan of the department and review progress in accomplishing the permanency goal. A permanency hearing may be held at any time and may be combined with the review hearing required under subsection (1) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) The court shall make written, case-specific findings whether the department made reasonable efforts to finalize the primary permanency goal in effect for the child. Lack of reasonable efforts to reunify may be a basis for an order approving a permanency plan with a permanency goal of reunification.
     </p>
     <p>
      (d) Where the permanency goal is not reunification, the hearing shall include a review of the department’s consideration of options for in-state and out-of-state placement of the child. In the case of a child in an out-of-state placement, the court shall determine whether the out-of-state placement continues to be appropriate and in the best interest of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      (e) The court shall ask each youth age twelve (12) years and older about his desired permanency outcome and discuss with the youth his current permanency plan. In the case of a child who has attained the age of fourteen (14) years and older, the hearing shall include a determination of the services needed to assist the youth to make the transition from foster care to successful adulthood.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) If a youth is in the legal custody of the department or other authorized agency and is within ninety (90) days of his eighteenth birthday, the department shall file a report with the court that includes the department’s transition plan for the youth. The court shall have a review or permanency hearing at which the court shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Discuss with the youth his or her transition plan; and
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Review the transition plan with the youth for purposes of ensuring that the plan provides the services necessary to allow the youth to transition to a successful adulthood.

At the hearing, the court shall determine whether to vest legal custody in the department or other authorized agency pursuant to section 16-1619(5)(b), Idaho Code. When a child under protective supervision is removed from his home pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section and the facts supporting the removal are presented to the court at a hearing, the hearing at which the court orders the child’s removal is the redisposition hearing.

       Unless there are compelling reasons it would not be in the best interest of the child, the department shall be required to file a petition to terminate parental rights within thirty (30) days of a judicial determination that an infant has been abandoned or that reasonable efforts are not required because aggravated circumstances were present.

       The department shall join as a party to the petition if such a petition to terminate is filed by another party; as well as to concurrently identify, recruit, process and approve a qualified family for adoption unless it is determined that such actions would not be in the best interest of the child, or the child is placed with a fit and willing relative.

       If termination of parental rights is granted and the child is placed in the guardianship or legal custody of the department, the court, upon petition, shall conduct a hearing as to the future status of the child within twelve (12) months of the order of termination of parental rights, and every twelve (12) months subsequently until the child is adopted or is in a placement sanctioned by the court.

        Mother’s motion to reinstate parental rights due to newly discovered evidence was properly denied because (1) three months after the mother’s parental rights were terminated, the mother discovered that a foster family’s foster license had been temporarily revoked due to physical abuse on another foster child; (2) the mother had not made a showing that the physical abuse on another child in the foster family was relevant to the issue of her own character and fitness as a parent; (3) a magistrate court reached its decision through an exercise of reason by comparing all the evidence and weighing how it related to the child’s best interest; and (4) the magistrate court addressed the issue of physical abuse and found that, at the age of 17, it would not have been in the child’s best interest to reinstate the mother’s parental rights.

        The facts indicated that, when under the mother’s care, children were in an unstable, unnurturing and dangerous environment; therefore, the trial court found sufficient evidence to support termination of the mother’s parental rights based on the conclusion that she had neglected the children and that the children’s best interests would be served by termination. Doe v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 122 Idaho 644, 837 P.2d 319 (Ct. App. 1992).
    Once the department had legal custody of the children — the parents stipulated to jurisdiction under the Idaho child protection act and the court placed the children in the department’s legal custody — the department, and not the court, had the authority to determine where the children were to live and the department was authorized to petition for termination. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 883, 436 P.3d 1232 (2019).

       <p>
        The department, working in conjunction with the court and other public and private agencies and persons, shall have the primary responsibility to implement the purpose of this chapter. To this end, the department is empowered and shall have the duty to do all things reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter, including, but not limited to, the following:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t16c16s16-1629ol11">
         The department shall administer treatment programs for the protection and care of neglected, abused and abandoned children, and in so doing may place in foster care, shelter care, or other diagnostic, treatment, or care centers or facilities children of whom it has been given custody. The department is to be governed by the standards found in chapter 12, title 39, Idaho Code.
        </li>
        <li id="t16c16s16-1629ol12">
         On December 1, the department shall make an annual statistical report to the governor covering the preceding fiscal year showing the number and status of persons in its custody and including such other data as will provide sufficient facts for sound planning in the conservation of children and youth. All officials and employees of the state and of every county and city shall furnish the department, upon request, such information within their knowledge and control as the department deems necessary. Local agencies shall report in such uniform format as may be required by the department.
        </li>
        <li id="t16c16s16-1629ol13">
         The department shall be required to maintain a central registry for the reporting of child neglect, abuse and abandonment information. Provided however, that the department shall not retain any information for this purpose relating to a child, or parent of a child, abandoned pursuant to chapter 82, title 39, Idaho Code.
        </li>
        <li id="t16c16s16-1629ol14">
         The department shall make periodic evaluation of all persons in its custody or under its protective supervision for the purpose of determining whether existing orders and dispositions in individual cases shall be modified or continued in force. Evaluations may be made as frequently as the department considers desirable and shall be made with respect to every person at intervals not exceeding six (6) months. Reports of evaluation made pursuant to this section shall be filed with the court that has jurisdiction. Reports of evaluation shall be provided to persons having full or partial legal or physical custody of a child. Failure of the department to evaluate a person or to reevaluate him within six (6) months of a previous examination shall not of itself entitle the person to a change in disposition but shall entitle him, his parent, guardian or custodian or his counsel to petition the court pursuant to section 16-1622, Idaho Code.
        </li>

        Once the department had legal custody of the children — the parents stipulated to jurisdiction under the Idaho child protection act and the court placed the children in the department’s legal custody — the department, and not the court, had the authority to determine where the children were to live and the department was authorized to petition for termination.

       <p>
        Magistrate’s findings that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the best interest of the children was supported by substantial and competent evidence because social workers testified about the sporadic visitations and contacts by the mother, the repeated drug use relapses, unemployment, and issues regarding domestic violence, and it had been more than sixteen months since the mother had been able to provide her children with a stable home. State v. Doe (In re Doe), 145 Idaho 662, 182 P.3d 1196 (2008).
    Under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c16s16-1602" target="_self">§§ 16-1602 </a></cite>and 16-2002 and this section, termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children, based on the parents’ history, and ongoing use, of controlled substances, which resulted in neglect of the children who were in foster care for seventeen out of twenty-two months. Idaho Dep’t of Health &amp; Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 149 Idaho 474, 235 P.3d 1195 (2010) (see 2013 amendment).

        Since the child protection act gives the department of health and welfare the affirmative right to determine where the child will live so long as the state has legal custody, the magistrate court was correct in ruling that the maternal care-giving grandmother did not have a conditional statutory right to intervene based on subsection (11) of this section.

        Neglect may be properly found under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c20s16-2002" target="_self">§ 16-2002</a></cite>(3)(b) where the mother was not reunified with her children for fifteen out of twenty-one months, while the state had spent over $80,000 on counseling, gas vouchers, rental assistance, and foster care and mother failed to maintain residential and financial stability. State v. Doe, 149 Idaho 409, 234 P.3d 733 (2010) (see 2013 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights to her children was proper because the magistrate court specifically found neglect on the grounds that the mother and her husband had failed to comply with their case plan by not: (1) providing Idaho department of health and welfare with a schedule of household chores, (2) completing a food safety course, (3) cooperating with visits from the department, (4) contacting a psychosocial rehabilitation agency, (5) following the recommendation in her psychological evaluation, (6) completing an 18-week parenting course, (7) writing out a list of developmental tasks for each child, and (8) coming up with a budget. Doe v. Doe, 150 Idaho 36, 244 P.3d 180 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father’s parental rights were properly terminated on the ground of neglect because he had neither completed a case plan nor reunited with them within the time limits of subsection (9). This section contemplates reunification within 15 months and the children here had been in foster care for 18 months. Doe v. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare (In re Doe), 151 Idaho 846, 264 P.3d 953 (2011) (see 2013 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights based upon neglect was proper and in the best interest of the child, where substantial evidence was presented at the termination hearing regarding the mother’s criminal history and drug use, her history with her other children, her general inability to support a child, and her insufficient efforts to comply with her case plan. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 145, 306 P.3d 230 (Ct. App. 2013).

       <p>
        A CPA action is not intended to provide a forum for multiple claimants to litigate their right to custody, because, once the department has legal custody of a child under the CPA, the department and not the court has the authority to determine where the child should live; even though the court retains jurisdiction over the child as long as state custody continues, the CPA provides the court only limited authority to review the department’s placement decisions.

        Summary judgment was properly awarded to the Idaho department of health and welfare on grandparents’ petition to adopt a child because the grandparents could not adopt the child without written consent from the department regardless of what facts they presented; the department had stated that it would not consent to the adoption.

       <p>
        Magistrate court’s decision terminating a father’s parental rights was reversed, where the magistrate court began its analysis with the presumption that termination of the father’s parental rights was in the child’s best interest. Application of the incorrect legal standard infected the trial and did not constitute harmless error. Doe v. Doe, 144 Idaho 534, 164 P.3d 814 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        While subsection (9) creates a rebuttable presumption that the department of health and welfare should initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights under certain conditions, it does not create a presumption that termination of the mother’s parental rights is in the child’s best interest. Such a conclusion must be proved by by clear and convincing evidence. In re Doe, 148 Idaho 124, 219 P.3d 448 (2009) (see 2013 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption in favor of the department initiating a termination petition set out in subsection (9) does not create a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights. A finding that it is in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights must still be made upon objective grounds, supported by substantial and competent evidence. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 152 Idaho 953, 277 P.3d 400 (Ct. App. 2012) (see 2013 amendment).

       <p>
        Where a child was out of the mother’s care for 18 of the last 22 months, despite its reluctance, the department of health and welfare was obligated under the law to file a petition for termination of parental rights, but, the magistrate court’s order terminating the mother’s parental rights was clearly erroneous. The magistrate erred in focusing on the mother’s conviction and past criminal behavior while dismissing relevant and competent evidence such as the social worker’s testimony and that reunification was possible and was occurring. State v. Roe (In re Doe), 142 Idaho 594, 130 P.3d 1132 (2006) (see 2013 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father’s parental rights were properly terminated where court found that father had neglected his child by failing to comply with the court’s orders in a case plan, by failing to reunify with his son within fifteen of the last twenty-two months, and by failing to demonstrate consistency in housing, employment, and/or abstinence from controlled substances, impairing his ability to provide proper parental care.

       PURPOSE
      </h4>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the crime control act, 4 U.S.C. section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (A) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (D) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (H) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (I) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (K) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (L) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (M) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the interstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules.

       The purpose of this chapter is to:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t16c20s16-2001ol11a">
         Provide for voluntary and involuntary severance of the parent and child relationship and for substitution of parental care and supervision by judicial process, thereby safeguarding the rights and interests of all parties concerned and promoting their welfare and that of the state of Idaho; and
        </li>
        <li id="t16c20s16-2001ol11b">
         Provide permanency for children who are under the jurisdiction of the court through the child protective act, chapter 16, title 16, Idaho Code, where the court has found the existence of aggravated circumstances or that reasonable efforts to return the child to his or her home have failed.

      <li id="t16c20s16-2001ol12">
       Implicit in this chapter is the philosophy that wherever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved and that the issue of severing the parent and child relationship is of such vital importance as to require a judicial determination in place of attempts at severance by contractual arrangements, express or implied, for the surrender and relinquishment of children. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow discrimination in favor of, or against, on the basis of disability.

        Failure of a father to exercise custody and visitation rights for fear that his insistence on such rights, in view of the mother’s attitude, would be detrimental to the child did not constitute abandonment of the child by failing to maintain a normal parental relationship.

        There is no requirement in this chapter that explicitly mandates psychotherapy for a parent before the state seeks termination of parental rights, and psychotherapy would not have been a reasonable option for the state to pursue before petitioning for termination of slightly mentally retarded mother’s rights in light of the mother’s disregard of the other efforts of assistance by the state. Brown v. State, 112 Idaho 901, 736 P.2d 1355 (Ct. App. 1987). Surrogate Parents.

       <p>
        Unless and until the legislature chooses to enact legislation specifically addressing surrogacy, intended parents must proceed within the legal avenues available to them to establish legal parenthood, a parental-rights termination proceeding under Title 16, Chapter 20, Idaho Code, and an adoption proceeding under Title 16, Chapter 15, Idaho Code.

       <p>
        Even though the father (who was incarcerated for lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor under 16 for his conduct with his adopted daughter) and his biological daughter shared a genuinely loving relationship, termination of the parent-child relationship was in the daughter’s best interest as she would be well supported by her maternal great-aunt, would benefit from a sense of finality and comparative normalcy and permanency following termination and her pending adoption, and would be entitled to public financial benefits following the adoption. Termination was also in the father’s best “psychological” interest in order to bring him closure and help him push past his delusions and seek the help he needed in psycho-sexual treatment. State v. Doe, 143 Idaho 383, 146 P.3d 649 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights based upon neglect was proper and in the best interest of the child, because substantial evidence was presented at the termination hearing regarding the mother’s criminal history and drug use, her history with her other children, her general inability to support a child, and her insufficient efforts to comply with her case plan. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 145, 306 P.3d 230 (Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a fundamental liberty interest is at stake, a court may terminate a parent-child relationship only if that decision is supported by clear and convincing evidence. Idaho Dep’t of Health And Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 161 Idaho 745, 390 P.3d 866 (Ct. App. 2017).

       <p>
        The record contained substantial and competent evidence supporting a magistrate judge’s findings of abandonment of the child by each parent based upon lack of contact and support of the child, their drug-related activities, and repeated incarcerations; termination of parental rights was in the child’s best interest. Doe v. Dep’t of Health & Welfare (In re Doe), 146 Idaho 759, 203 P.3d 689 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the father was serving probation for felony injury to a child, the terms of his sexual abuse treatment program required that he not contact any minor children and his wife refused to consent to his contact with their children. In a termination of parental rights proceeding, substantial evidence supported the magistrate’s finding that he did not willfully abandon his children within the meaning of subsection (5) of this section. Doe I v. Doe II (In re Doe), 148 Idaho 713, 228 P.3d 980 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of abandonment was proper, although there was an enforceable no contact with mother order, where it was undisputed that father had no contact whatsoever with his daughter and he provided no financial support for her. Doe v. Doe, 149 Idaho 392, 234 P.3d 716 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in terminating a father’s parental rights to his child on the ground of abandonment, because the court did not adequately consider how the father’s position in the military might have severely limited his ability to maintain a normal relationship with his child and the court did not give adequate consideration to the fact that the father had stayed current on his child support payments. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 150 Idaho 46, 244 P.3d 190 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported an order terminating a father’s parental rights on the ground of abandonment where he failed to maintain regular contact with the children and the children had bonded with their stepfather; the magistrate was justified in finding that the father’s attempt to blame his financial difficulties was unpersuasive. Doe v. Doe, 152 Idaho 77, 266 P.3d 1182 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision terminating the parental rights of a Mexican citizen to his daughter born in the United States on the ground of abandonment was not supported by substantial evidence, where there was no evidence that he had the ability to establish any relationship with his daughter as long as she was in the custody of the department and he was in Mexico, legally barred from entering the United States. Additionally, there is no evidence that he had the ability to pay support, and he consistently expressed the desire to have custody of daughter, doing all that he could do for that to happen. In re Doe, 153 Idaho 258, 281 P.3d 95 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated because substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s decision that the mother had willfully failed to maintain a normal parental relationship with the child, as she failed to contact the child for over a year, even though at times she was geographically close to him, and, even when she eventually was in contact with him under the visitation stipulation, her visits were sporadic. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 505, 314 P.3d 187 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court erred by terminating the father’s parental rights and granting the stepfather’s petition to adopt the child; because the record showed that the mother secreted herself and the child from the father, and that the father was active in the child’s life up until the mother asked the father to terminate his rights and, then, changed her phone number, job, and place of residence. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 156 Idaho 532, 328 P.3d 512 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inconsistency between a magistrate court’s oral findings of fact and written conclusions of law required a vacation of an order terminating a biological father’s parental rights. The magistrate found that the husband failed to meet his burden of proving willful abandonment and instead determined that termination was appropriate, based on the biological father’s past and future incarceration. However, the subsequent memorandum decision stated that the biological father had abandoned the child by failing to maintain a normal parental relationship with the child. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 159 Idaho 461, 362 P.3d 536 (2015).
    District court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to her children, because clear and convincing evidence established that she abandoned the children by failing to maintain a normal parental relationship and neglected them by failing to provide meaningful support where she had some financial ability to do so, had a difficult time keeping a job and permanent residence, and did not provide any resources to help the children, cover expenses of any kind or cover the cost of keeping the children while they were in the care of their paternal great-grandparents. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 161 Idaho 532, 387 P.3d 785 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father had abandoned child pursuant to this section, where, at the time of the hearing, the father had been completely absent from the child’s life for approximately one-half of her life and he made no effort to contact the child, when he knew, at least, where the mother worked. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 163 Idaho 399, 414 P.3d 221 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Maternal grandmother and step-grandfather’s petition to adopt a child and terminate the father’s parental rights was properly granted, as the father willfully abandoned the child without just cause. He never supported the child financially; although, despite his time in prison, he had financial resources available, after the sale of his home and with his receipt of Social Security disability benefits. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 443 P.3d 213 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grandparents were entitled to terminate the parental rights of a mother — their daughter — to the mother’s child — their grandchild — because the grandparents were caring for the child and wished to adopt the child. Furthermore, the mother had abandoned the child, had issues with mental health, substance abuse, periodic incarceration, and financial stability, and failed to maintain a normal parental relationship through reasonable support and/or regular personal contact with the child. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1130 (2019).

        Parents’ failure to comply with the magistrate court’s orders to complete their case plan, for the proper care and supervision of their children, meets the definition of “neglected” in this section. In re Termination of Doe v. Doe (In re Termination of Doe), 147 Idaho 353, 209 P.3d 650 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order terminating a mother’s parental rights to her five children under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c20s16-2005" target="_self">§ 16-2005</a></cite>(1)(b) was proper because she had neglected her children within the meaning of paragraph (3)(b) of this section by her failure to comply with her case plan, her failure to maintain safe, stable and adequate housing, and her ongoing relationship with a convicted sex offender. State v. Doe, 149 Idaho 409, 234 P.3d 733 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neglect may be properly found under paragraph (3)(b) where the mother was not reunified with her children for fifteen out of twenty-one months, while the state had spent over $80,000 on counseling, gas vouchers, rental assistance, and foster care and mother failed to maintain residential and financial stability. State v. Doe, 149 Idaho 409, 234 P.3d 733 (2010).
    Under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c16s16-1602" target="_self">§§ 16-1602 </a></cite>and 16-1629 and this section, termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children, based on the parents’ history, and ongoing use, of controlled substances, which resulted in neglect of the children who were in foster care for seventeen out of twenty-two months. Idaho Dep’t of Health &amp; Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 149 Idaho 474, 235 P.3d 1195 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the magistrate’s decision that termination was proper because the mother and father neglected the children by failing to comply with their case plan and by failing to provide proper care and control, given that: (1) the children had been seen unsupervised, (2) the mother and father had inconsistent compliance with their case plan, (3) they did not provide child support or maintain regular phone contact with the children, (4) all the witnesses were in agreement as to the inadequate and unstable living conditions and lack of improvement by the mother and father, and (5) the mother and father were unwilling or unable to provide the care and stability the children needed. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 149 Idaho 564, 237 P.3d 661 (Ct. App. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of neglect was supported when the mother failed to perform many requirements of the care plan, including undergoing a psychological evaluation, providing verification of financial stability, maintaining a safe and stable home, developing a custody agreement with the father, and applying any learned parenting skills to caring for the child. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 149 Idaho 627, 238 P.3d 724 (Ct. App. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights to her children was proper because the magistrate court specifically found neglect on the grounds that the mother and her husband had failed to comply with their case plan by not: (1) providing Idaho department of health and welfare with a schedule of household chores, (2) completing a food safety course, (3) cooperating with visits from the department, (4) contacting a psychosocial rehabilitation agency, (5) following the recommendation in her psychological evaluation, (6) completing an 18-week parenting course, (7) writing out a list of developmental tasks for each child, and (8) coming up with a budget. Doe v. Doe, 150 Idaho 36, 244 P.3d 180 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        The magistrate court placed excessive emphasis upon father’s admittedly abhorrent behavior prior to the removal of the children from his home, and upon minor noncompliance with reporting requirements that had not been in effect for half a year prior to the termination hearing, while disregarding or giving minimal attention to the compelling evidence of father’s success in overcoming alcoholism, complying with treatment requirements, maintaining remunerative employment, and becoming a nurturing parent with whom the children had developed a strong bond. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 150 Idaho 752, 250 P.3d 803 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights because there was substantial evidence that he neglected his children. After his release from prison, he failed to establish suitable living arrangements, failed to obtain adequate employment, and was convicted of driving without privileges. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 151 Idaho 498, 260 P.3d 1169 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In terminating a father’s parental rights, evidence of his failure to comply with his case plan was properly considered as a basis for neglect. Ida. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 151 Idaho 356, 256 P.3d 764 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of both parents’ rights was proper where the father was incarcerated, and where neither parent had reunited with the children or completed requirements of their case plans. Further, the children had lived in foster care for 18 months preceding trial. Doe v. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare (In re Doe), 151 Idaho 846, 264 P.3d 953 (2011).
    Trial court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights under subsection (3), because he neglected his child by conduct or omission, which caused the child to be without proper parental care and control, subsistence, medical, or other care or control. The father had not expressed a genuine interest in learning about the child’s special needs, let alone how to care for those needs on a daily basis. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 152 Idaho 644, 273 P.3d 685 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, substantial evidence supported the finding that appellant mother neglected her children by failing to comply with her case plan: appellant failed to maintain safe housing and employment, did not demonstrate adequate parenting skills, and resisted suggestions for improvement. In re Doe, 152 Idaho 910, 277 P.3d 357 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights based upon neglect was proper and in the best interest of the child, because substantial evidence was presented at the termination hearing regarding the mother’s criminal history and drug use, her history with her other children, her general ability to support a child, and her insufficient efforts to comply with the case plan; there was no requirement to wait fifteen months to file a petition for termination of parental rights. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 145, 306 P.3d 230 (Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother failed to show that the trial court erred in finding neglect; in part, the mother failed to get her children to school and counseling sessions and did not provide financial support; and, it was hard to find any area of parental responsibility that the mother consistently met. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 156 Idaho 103, 320 P.3d 1262 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial evidence to support the termination of a father’s parental rights based on neglect and abuse. He failed to provide for the well-being of his children, as he did not complete counseling services, did not actively participate in parenting classes, and did not intervene when his children were being abused by his spouse. Further, the father’s inability to discharge parental responsibilities had been ongoing for years. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 159 Idaho 664, 365 P.3d 420 (Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err in terminating a mother’s parental rights because the evidence was substantial and competent support for its finding of neglect; the mother’s return with her child to live with the father after discovering his sexual abuse of the child’s older sister exemplified her inability to prioritize the child’s well-being over her own relationships, and her missed urinalysis tests and arrests reflected her general inability to care for the child. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 160 Idaho 154, 369 P.3d 932 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Impossibility may be asserted as a defense to a claim of neglect founded upon failure to comply with the requirements of a case plan. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 161 Idaho 596, 389 P.3d 141 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the magistrate court had made no findings as to whether the mother was responsible for the circumstances which led to her failure to complete the case plan, possibly invoking the provisions of paragraph (3)(b), a remand was necessary. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 161 Idaho 596, 389 P.3d 141 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper on the basis of neglect because, despite the mother’s recent progress, she had longstanding history of drug abuse and relapses and neglectful conduct: one of the children was seriously injured in an automobile accident due to the mother driving while under the influence; she used drugs while pregnant or while the children were in her care; she had failed to provide stable and safe housing for her children; and she was not a consistent presence in the children’s lives, as she had been absent because of drug usage, because the care of the children was overwhelming to her, and because of incarceration. Idaho Dep’t of Health v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 162 Idaho 69, 394 P.3d 112 (Ct. App. 2017).
    Magistrate court correctly found that a mother failed to follow her case plan and was unable to discharge her parental responsibilities, establishing neglect. The mother’s recent and modest improvements were insufficient to overcome her history of demonstrated unfitness. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 161 Idaho 754, 390 P.3d 1281 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of incarceration is competent evidence of neglect. A parent who is incarcerated for a substantial portion of his or her child’s life cannot provide any amount of parental care and control, subsistence, medical or other care, or control necessary for the child’s well-being. Idaho Dep’t of Health And Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 162 Idaho 400, 397 P.3d 1159 (Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s finding that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests based on neglect was supported by substantial, competent evidence, where the mother was unable to provide a stable and permanent home for child; there was ample evidence that the child improved under foster care, and the mother demonstrated a consistent inability to care for the child. Idaho Dep’t. of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 163 Idaho 274, 411 P.3d 1175 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court had substantial and competent evidence to terminate the mother’s parental rights on the ground of neglect, where she failed to point to any evidence supporting her statement that she participated in the case plan, she failed to complete several of the tasks outlined in the plan, she was unable to protect the children from the father, and her mental and physical conditions impaired her ability to parent. Idaho Dept. of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 163 Idaho 367, 413 P.3d 767 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported the finding that the mother neglected her children, as the mother made almost no progress on the major case plan tasks, like obtaining stable housing and employment, completing drug treatment, having a history of negative drug tests, getting mental health treatment and an anger assessment, and completing parenting classes and applying what she learned. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 486, 432 P.3d 35 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parents neglected their children and were unlikely to make the permanent changes necessary to properly care for the children, as the mother showed an inability to parent due to mental and substance abuse issues, the father failed to comply with his case plan, the children were in foster care for the required period without reunification being accomplished, and the father was unable to provide the parental care necessary for the children’s health, safety, and well-being. Dep’t of Health And Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 437 P.3d 33 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a father’s parental rights was appropriate, because there was substantial, competent evidence supporting the magistrate court’s finding that the father neglected the father’s children, as he failed to complete his case plan. Despite periods of incarceration, which the magistrate court properly considered, the father was responsible, whether directly or indirectly, for non-compliance with the requirements of the case plan. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 875, 436 P.3d 1224 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on neglect was proper because, although the mother challenged the magistrate court’s finding of neglect based on her failure to complete her case plan, the mother did not challenge the additional bases upon which the magistrate court found the mother neglected the child; and the court found neglect on the additional bases of the mother’s continued methamphetamine use, periods of incarceration, and probation violations. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 437 P.3d 922 (2019).
    Magistrate court did not err in determining that the mother neglected a child, where the finding was based upon the developmental delays shown in the child and his malnourishment that occurred between his first and second placements in foster care. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1162 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s finding that a father neglected his children, as defined by subdivision (3)(b), where the children had been in the custody of the Idaho department of health and welfare for 15 of the most recent 22 months without reunification occurring. While it was not impossible for the father to comply with any tasks in his case plan, his failure to do so stemmed largely from his lack of effort. State v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1140 (2019).
       </p>

        Substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s finding that the mother neglected her children, where she failed to comply with her case plan and the children had been in the custody of the Idaho department of health and welfare for 15 of the most recent 22 months prior to termination, without reunification occurring.

        Man, who is neither child’s adoptive nor biological father, cannot assert his status as child’s parent only on the basis of a child support order obtained by the department which stated hat he “is the legal father” of child.

        Where substantial and competent evidence supported the magistrate’s determination that the presumed father was never married to the mother and was not the child’s adoptive or biological father, the magistrate did not err when he determined that the presumed father did not meet the statutory definition of a “parent” or “presumptive father.” Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v.

       <p>
        The 2000 amendment, by ch. 171, in the introductory language, inserted “(1)” following “one”; in the paragraphs following subdivision f. substituted “..” for “19”; deleted former subdivision g. which read: “Where consent to termination of parental rights is implied by reason of the failure of a putative father to establish paternity in the manner prescribed in section 16-1513, Idaho Code”; redesignated former subdivision h. as present subdivision g.; deleted former subdivision i. which read: “In the case of a father’s parental relationship, where the father has failed to file notice of claim to paternity and willingness to assume responsibility as provided in section 16-1513(3), Idaho Code”; redesignated former subdivision j. as present subdivision h., and in concluding language, substituted “subsection h.” for “subsection j.”
    The 2013 amendment, by ch. 287, rewrote paragraph (2)(b) which formerly read: “The parent has subjected the child to torture, chronic abuse or sexual abuse, has committed murder or intentionally killed the other parent of the child, has committed murder or voluntary manslaughter of another child or has aided, abetted, conspired or solicited to commit such murder or voluntary manslaughter, and/or has committed battery which resulted in serious bodily injury to a child; or.”

        Abandonment.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence that a father, after a divorce in which custody of his children was awarded to his wife and after the wife’s remarriage and removal to the state of Connecticut, failed to make substantial contribution to their support, to visit them, or to make sufficient inquiry of their whereabouts to locate them was sufficient to sustain a finding that such father had abandoned his children. Clark v. Jelinek, 90 Idaho 592, 414 P.2d 892 (1966).
    The standards prescribed by this section for determining abandonment are not applicable to that term in an adoption proceeding and the children of a divorced father could not be adopted by their mother’s subsequent husband without their father’s consent on the ground that he had abandoned them by failure to maintain a normal parental relationship. Clayton v. Jones, 91 Idaho 87, 416 P.2d 34 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though failure of a parent to maintain the normal parental relationship without just cause for a period of over one year is prima facie evidence of abandonment, the burden of persuasion of abandonment remains with the petitioner who seeks to terminate the parent-child relationship. In re Matthews, 97 Idaho 99, 540 P.2d 284 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of a father to exercise custody and visitation rights for fear that his insistence on such rights, in view of the mother’s attitude, would be detrimental to the child did not constitute abandonment of the child by failing to maintain a normal parental relationship. In re Matthews, 97 Idaho 99, 540 P.2d 284 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father’s failure to provide any support for his children or to make any real attempt to communicate with them for over one year, despite the fact that he knew their mother was unable to care for them and that they had been placed in foster care, was sufficient evidence to support a finding of abandonment. Crum v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 111 Idaho 407, 725 P.2d 112 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court finds that abandonment is established by clear and convincing evidence, those findings will not be overturned on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous; clear error will not be deemed to exist where the findings are supported by substantial and competent, albeit conflicting, evidence. Crum v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 111 Idaho 407, 725 P.2d 112 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and competent evidence supported termination of father’s parental rights, where grounds of abandonment and neglect existed and termination was in the best interests of parent and child. Craven v. Doe, 128 Idaho 490, 915 P.2d 720 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the father was in prison when his child was born and had never seen his child or provided financial support for him, but after learning of the child’s birth, he sent the child several Christmas gifts, tried to speak with the child’s mother and maternal grandmother, wrote to the grandmother without receiving a response, signed documents authorizing medical treatment for the child, contacted the caseworker a number of times, and wrote a letter to the magistrate court indicating that he did not want his parental rights terminated, and the mother’s parental rights were already terminated, the father’s failure to complete the “rider” program after the child was born and get out of prison early was not substantial competent evidence that supported a finding by clear and convincing evidence of abandonment; the father’s efforts to maintain a relationship with the child had to be judged in terms of the reality of his imprisonment and not trivialized. Doe v. State, 137 Idaho 758, 53 P.3d 341 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order terminating father’s rights was reversed, where the magistrate judge failed to adequately consider the father’s evidence that the lack of a normal parental relationship was not without just cause. There was no consideration of the distance between the parties or the fact that the father had missed work due to injuries and was heavily in debt. Roe v. Doe (In re Doe), 143 Idaho 188, 141 P.3d 1057 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the father was serving probation for felony injury to a child, the terms of his sexual abuse treatment program required that he not contact any minor children and his wife refused to consent to his contact with their children. In a termination of parental rights proceeding, substantial evidence supported the magistrate’s finding that he did not willfully abandon his children within the meaning of paragraph (1)(a) of this section. Doe I v. Doe II (In re Doe), 148 Idaho 713, 228 P.3d 980 (2010).
    Trial court erred in terminating a father’s parental rights to his child on the ground of abandonment under this section, because the court did not adequately consider how the father’s position in the military might have severely limited his ability to maintain a normal relationship with his child and the court did not give adequate consideration to the fact that the father had stayed current on his child support payments. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 150 Idaho 46, 244 P.3d 190 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported an order terminating a father’s parental rights on the ground of abandonment where he failed to maintain regular contact with the children and the children had bonded with their stepfather; the magistrate was justified in finding that the father’s attempt to blame his financial difficulties was unpersuasive. Doe v. Doe, 152 Idaho 77, 266 P.3d 1182 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision terminating the parental rights of a Mexican citizen to his daughter born in the United States on the ground of abandonment was not supported by substantial evidence, where there was no evidence that he had the ability to establish any relationship with his daughter as long as she was in the custody of the department and he was in Mexico, legally barred from entering the United States. Additionally, there is no evidence that he had the ability to pay support, and he consistently expressed the desire to have custody of daughter, doing all that he could do for that to happen. In re Doe, 153 Idaho 258, 281 P.3d 95 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate’s finding that the father had legally abandoned his child under paragraph (1)(a) was supported by clear and convincing evidence, where the father willfully failed to maintain a normal parental relationship, did not provide any significant reasonable financial support, was unable to have regular personal contact with the child, was in prison when the child was born, continued to commit new offenses, and did not engage in any parent/child relationship. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 154 Idaho 175, 296 P.3d 381 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated, because substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s decision that the mother had willfully failed to maintain a normal parental relationship with the child, as she failed to contact the child for over a year, even though at times she was geographically close to him, and, even when she eventually was in contact with him under the visitation stipulation, her visits were sporadic. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 505, 314 P.3d 187 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court erred by terminating the father’s parental rights and granting the stepfather’s petition to adopt the child; because the record showed that the mother secreted herself and the child from the father, and that the father was active in the child’s life up until the mother asked the father to terminate his rights and, then, changed her phone number, job, and place of residence. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 156 Idaho 532, 328 P.3d 512 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inconsistency between a magistrate court’s oral findings of fact and written conclusions of law required a vacation of an order terminating a biological father’s parental rights. The magistrate found that the husband failed to meet his burden of proving willful abandonment and instead determined that termination was appropriate, based on the biological father’s past and future incarceration. However, the subsequent memorandum decision stated that the biological father had abandoned the child by failing to maintain a normal parental relationship with the child. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 159 Idaho 461, 362 P.3d 536 (2015).
    Maternal grandmother and step-grandfather’s petition to adopt a child and terminate the father’s parental rights was properly granted, as the father willfully abandoned the child without just cause. He never supported the child financially; although, despite his time in prison, he had financial resources available, after the sale of his home and with his receipt of Social Security disability benefits. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 443 P.3d 213 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grandparents were entitled to terminate the parental rights of a mother — their daughter — to the mother’s child — their grandchild — because the grandparents were caring for the child and wished to adopt the child. Furthermore, the mother had abandoned the child, had issues with mental health, substance abuse, periodic incarceration, and financial stability, and failed to maintain a normal parental relationship through reasonable support and/or regular personal contact with the child. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1130 (2019).

       <p>
        Where evidence indicated that plaintiff’s daughter was subjected to extensive, long-term mistreatment, that plaintiff was aware of wife striking daughter and had admitted that fact to deputy sheriff, there was sufficient evidence to terminate parental rights to the child under this section, since plaintiff at the very least acquiesced to the physical abuse of his daughter and failed to take any preventive measures to assure the child’s future protection. Castro v. State Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 102 Idaho 218, 628 P.2d 1052 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate erred in finding that, in not specifically using the word “abuse,” the state did not allege abuse as a ground for termination under paragraph (1)(b), when the language used by the state in describing the second ground for termination was almost identical to the definition of abused under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c16s16-1602" target="_self">§ 16-1602</a></cite>(1)(a).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where, in an action to terminate parental rights, the burden of proving neglect by clear and convincing evidence has been noted explicitly and applied by the trial judge, the appellate court will not disturb the trial court’s findings unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A parent-child relationship may be terminated by the court when it finds that the parent has neglected or abused the child or that termination is found to be in the best interests of the parent and child; on appeal the supreme court will not disturb those findings, if they are supported by substantial and competent evidence. Dayley v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 112 Idaho 522, 733 P.2d 743 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial and competent, albeit conflicting, evidence to affirm the finding of the magistrate court that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate the parental rights of the parents. That evidence included findings by the magistrate that: (1) one child had difficulties with speech and suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and reactive attachment disorder, while the other child was significantly delayed in development, both physically and mentally; (2) the children had been removed from the home due to physical abuse, unsanitary conditions, and repeated reports of poor parenting; (3) the parents had a lack of recognition of the problems that brought the children to the attention of child protection services and an unwillingness to make changes necessary to allow reunification to occur; and (4) the parents lacked knowledge related to basic day-to-day care, parenting and behavior management coupled with the unwillingness or inability to utilize what they have been taught to improve the quality of their children’s life experiences. Doe v. Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 141 Idaho 511, 112 P.3d 799 (2005).
    Grounds for termination of parental rights must be shown by clear and convincing evidence, because each parent has a fundamental liberty interest in maintaining a relationship with his or her child. Clear and convincing evidence is generally understood to be evidence indicating that the thing to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain. On appeal, an appellate court will not disturb the magistrate court’s decision to terminate parental rights, if there is substantial, competent evidence in the record to support the decision. Substantial, competent evidence is such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. An appellate court is required to conduct an independent review of the magistrate court record, but must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the magistrate court’s judgment because the magistrate court has the opportunity to observe witnesses’ demeanor, to assess their credibility, to detect prejudice or motive, and to judge the character of the parties. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 152 Idaho 263, 270 P.3d 1048 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in her opening brief, mother did not contest that substantial and competent evidence existed to support the district court’s holding that mother neglected child and was unable to discharge her parental responsibilities, she will have been deemed to have waived that issue.

        Best Interests of Child.

       <p>
        The best interests of the parent must be considered only when terminating the relationship under subsection (3); however, the best interests of the child must be considered when terminating the relationship under any provision of this section. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the children’s behavior and school work generally improved while they were living away from the mother, the children themselves told the judge that they felt insecure at their mother’s home and did not want to live there, and the caseworker stated that the children needed a permanent, stable living arrangement that the mother had been unable to provide, the magistrate’s finding that termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests was supported by substantial evidence and had to be sustained on appeal. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The finding that reuniting the family would be extremely remote falls within the condition permitting termination in the best interests of the parent and child. Dayley v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 112 Idaho 522, 733 P.2d 743 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a statutory ground for termination is found, the magistrate must then decide what is in the best interest of the child. Doe v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 123 Idaho 502, 849 P.2d 963 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mother failed to complete her chemical dependency program, continued to use drugs, refused to obey a curfew, and committed many other probation violations, the evidence supported the magistrate’s conclusion that the best interests of the child required that the parental rights be terminated. State v. Doe, 133 Idaho 826, 992 P.2d 1226 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no requirement that a party seeking termination of parental rights present expert testimony to support the assertion that termination would be in the best interests of the child. Doe v. Roe, 133 Idaho 805, 992 P.2d 1205 (1999).
    Termination of mother’s parental rights was in a child’s best interest under subsection (1), because the child was 22 months old and had been in foster care since seven weeks of age and mother had not demonstrated that she would not resume using methamphetamine. In re Doe 2009-19, 150 Idaho 201, 245 P.3d 953 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported the magistrate’s finding that termination of a father’s parental rights would be in the children’s best interest given that: (1) the father had a long criminal history, including gang membership, (2) he was currently incarcerated for aggravated assault, (3) he continued to incur new charges after the children were born, (4) he did not provide the children with daily support and it was likely to be a long time before he was prepared to be a parent to them, and (5) he could not provide the children with stability and permanency. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe, 152 Idaho 797, 275 P.3d 23 (Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a child may enjoy a higher standard of living in the United States than in a foreign country where the child’s parent resided was not a reason to terminate the parental rights of a foreign national; rather, the natural parent presumption applied. In re Doe, 153 Idaho 258, 281 P.3d 95 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s finding that termination of the father’s parental rights was in his child’s best interests where the father had been convicted of murder, the record suggested that the person he murdered was someone he believed helped the mother and the child escape, the father had prior felony convictions, the mother testified the father was violent to both her and the child, he had threatened to run away with the child, and he drank excessively every day, and he only contacted the mother twice in the four years since they had left him, and the father was to be incarcerated until after the child reached majority. Doe v. Doe, 159 Idaho 192, 358 P.3d 77 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a statutory ground for termination has been established, the trial court must next determine whether it is in the best interest of the child to terminate the parent-child relationship. When determining whether termination is in the child’s best interest, the trial court may consider: the parent’s history with substance abuse, the stability and permanency of the home, the unemployment of the parent, the financial contribution of the parent to the child’s care after the child is placed in protective custody, the improvement of the child while in foster care, the parent’s efforts to improve his or her situation, and the parent’s continuing problems with the law. A finding that it is in the best interest of the child to terminate parental rights must still be made upon objective grounds, supported by substantial and competent evidence. Idaho Dep’t of Health And Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 161 Idaho 745, 390 P.3d 866 (Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s conclusion that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in her children’s best interests was supported by substantial, competent evidence. Among other things, the mother had continuing problems with the law, as demonstrated by her frequent incarcerations, and the fact that the children improved while in the legal custody of the Idaho department of health and welfare. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 161 Idaho 754, 390 P.3d 1281 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests, as the children had improved while in foster care; whereas, before entering foster care, the children did not have their emotional, educational, or physical needs met. Idaho Dep’t of Health v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 162 Idaho 69, 394 P.3d 112 (Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interest given the mother’s lack of stable employment, lack of effort to improve her situation, failure as to mental health treatment, resistance to drug testing, incarceration, and stability of the children in their placement. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 236, 395 P.3d 1269 (2017).

       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err when it found clear and convincing evidence supported the finding that the termination of a father’s parental rights was in the best interest of the child, because it properly considered the child’s relationship with the stepfather and the fact that the father had not paid child support or made a substantial effort to contact the child. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 653, 402 P.3d 1106 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s conclusion that termination of parents’ parental rights was in the best interest of their child: the parents failed to financially support the child; there was considerable testimony regarding the child’s physical, emotional, and academic improvement after being removed from the parents’ care; the guardian ad litem recommended termination of parental rights; and the child’s grandparents, with whom the child was living, wanted to adopt the child. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 163 Idaho 1, 407 P.3d 588 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s finding that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests based on neglect was supported by substantial, competent evidence, where the mother was unable to provide a stable and permanent home for child; there was ample evidence that the child improved under foster care, and the mother demonstrated a consistent inability to care for the child. Idaho Dep’t. of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 163 Idaho 274, 411 P.3d 1175 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that termination of the mother and father’s parental rights was in the children’s best interest, where the case manager testified that the father had not internalized the parental training he received and was not invested in making necessary changes in his parenting and that she was gravely concerned that he would revert to his past abusive behaviors, the magistrate court found that testimony credible, other witnesses testified similarly, and only the parents testified that they thought the father could have been a safe and protective parent. Idaho Dept. of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 163 Idaho 367, 413 P.3d 767 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding that termination was in the best interest of child was supported by substantial and competent evidence of the father’s conduct, both before and after incarceration, because the father was incarcerated for having sex with girls that were underage. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 163 Idaho 399, 414 P.3d 221 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s decision that termination of a father’s parental rights was in child’s best interest was supported by substantial and competent evidence, because child was improving in foster care in a stable and safe home and child was with her half-brother, to whom she had a significant connection and attachment that she would lose if the father’s parental rights were not terminated. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 98, 425 P.3d 1241 (2018).
    Guardians’ request for termination of the mother’s parental rights was properly granted, because achieving some permanency for the children was in their best interests; the mother had a history of substance abuse before, during, and after her time caring for the children; the mother provided little to no financial support for the children while they were in her care and only minimal support while they were under the guardians’ care; both children had thrived under the guardians’ care and were treated as members of the family; and, when the older child was reunited with the mother, the stress of the interaction was enough for her to regress in her progress and suffer physical symptoms of anxiety. Doe I v. Doe (In re Doe II), 164 Idaho 511, 432 P.3d 60 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err in determining that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the best interests of her child. It was appropriate for the magistrate court to emphasize the mother’s lack of progress in drug treatment. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 849, 436 P.3d 670 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights was in the children’s best interest, because the parents failed to provide a stable, permanent home for the children and struggled with both sobriety and maintaining consistent, gainful employment; the children found a safe and stable home in foster care with their grandparents; the children made significant improvements while in foster care; and the children’s contact with the parents was never consistent or predictable. Dep’t of Health And Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 437 P.3d 33 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the father’s parental rights was in the child’s best interest because: the father did not have a suitable home for the child; he was currently on parole and was a registered sex offender; and the child had only known her grandparents as her parents.. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 443 P.3d 213 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a father’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests, where the older child’s needs were not being met when she was living with her parents and she had substantially improved while in foster care, the father had not established a bond with the younger child, and her foster parents testified that the younger child required extra nurturing and patience, which the foster family had given to her since she was placed in their home. State v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1140 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests, where the needs of two children were not being met, the two children had substantially improved while in foster care, a third child was born testing positive for methamphetamine and had benefitted from her foster parents’ nurturing, and all three children needed stable, structured, safe, and sober environments in order to thrive. State v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), — Idaho —, 454 P.3d 1151 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights, because she had a drug addition, had left on a trip to California, had been incarcerated, and was unable to provide a safe and stable home for the child based on her spotty employment and housing history. The child’s best interests and need for stability could not wait for the mother to finish her case plan or have the time that she needed to devote to the child. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (2019-32) (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 457 P.3d 154 (2020).

        In a proceeding to terminate a parent-child relationship, the due process clause mandates that the grounds for termination must be shown by clear and convincing evidence and where trial court finds that the grounds as defined by statute, which are alleged for termination, are established by clear and convincing evidence, these findings will not be overturned on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous and clear error will not be deemed to exist where the findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence, albeit, conflicting evidence. Also, the appellate court in reviewing such findings will indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court’s judgment. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare v.

       <p>
        Order terminating an incarcerated father’s parental rights was proper as he had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter and was likely to remain incarcerated during the remainder of his children’s minority, and the children had no independent recollection of the father. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 148 Idaho 243, 220 P.3d 1062 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father’s incarceration provided a basis for termination of his parental rights under paragraph (1)(e) because the father had been, and was likely to remain, incarcerated for a substantial (important or meaningful) period of the child’s minority. Given his history of drug abuse, prior criminal record and past failure to successfully complete the requirements of probation, it was likely that considerable time would pass before he was able to regain custody of the child; and the child was in her formative years. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 151 Idaho 605, 261 P.3d 882 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father’s parental rights should not have been terminated under this section, as the decision to terminate his rights was based solely upon the jury verdict finding him guilty of murdering the children’s mother and the subsequent judgment of conviction, both of which were vacated upon appeal of the criminal case. In re Termination of the Parental Rights of Doe, 158 Idaho 548, 348 P.3d 163 (2015).
    Magistrate court’s decision that the mother had been and was likely to be incarcerated for a substantial period of the child’s minority applied an erroneous legal standard, as it focused on the duration of her past incarceration, not the expected duration of future incarceration. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 161 Idaho 596, 389 P.3d 141 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was no error to find termination of an incarcerated father’s parental rights was in a child’s best interest because, inter alia, the child was three and a half years old when the father was sentenced to prison and would be 18 and a half years old when the father had served his minimum sentence.

        Though what constitutes a “substantial period of time” is undefined in paragraph (1)(e), a trial court may consider factors including, but not limited to: the age of the child; the relationship, if any, that has developed between the parent and the child; and the likely period of time the parent will remain incarcerated. The court must consider the expected length of future incarceration, not the amount of time the parent has spent incarcerated in the past. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v.

        Neglect.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Termination of a slightly mentally retarded mother’s parental rights to her two children would be upheld in view of evidence that the children were abused, neglected, and abandoned, that, because of the mother’s inability or lack of desire, there appeared to be little or no chance of improvement in conditions for the children, and that the mother, although she expressed love for her children, was barely able to provide basic care for herself, let alone her children. Brown v. State, 112 Idaho 901, 736 P.2d 1355 (Ct. App. 1987). Neglect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the statutory definition of “neglect” suggests that a child must suffer demonstrable harm before the parent-child relationship can be terminated; it is sufficient that the child lacks parental care necessary for his health, morals and well-being. The termination statutes of this state exist not merely to alleviate harm but to prevent it. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Cheatwood, 108 Idaho 218, 697 P.2d 1232 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>

        Whether neglect has occurred is a question of fact, to be determined in the first instance by the trial judge upon a constitutionally mandated standard of clear and convincing evidence; when neglect has been found upon this standard, the judge’s finding — like any finding of fact — is reviewable upon the appellate standard of substantial evidence. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Cheatwood, 108 Idaho 218, 697 P.2d 1232 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the acts by which the natural mother initially became noncustodial, as well as her conduct thereafter, are the very acts constituting neglect, her conduct toward the child would not be evaluated solely in terms of a noncustodial parent. Thompson v. Thompson, 110 Idaho 93, 714 P.2d 62 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>

        Termination for parental neglect under subdivision b [now (1)(b)] of this section is not contingent upon a showing that the parent will somehow benefit. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the mother failed to provide the parental care necessary for the children’s health, morals and well-being, the magistrate’s finding that the mother had neglected her daughters was supported by substantial evidence and would not be disturbed. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and competent evidence was presented to support the magistrate’s determination that the mother had neglected the children by failing to provide parental care necessary for the health, morals and well-being of the children. Doe v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 123 Idaho 502, 849 P.2d 963 (Ct. App. 1993).

        Neglect is a permissible ground for termination, even where the parent being terminated is a noncustodial parent. State v. Doe, 133 Idaho 826, 992 P.2d 1226 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate did not err by dismissing the Idaho department of health and welfare’s petition to terminate parental rights, where there was no clear and convincing evidence to support the termination based on neglect; the evidence showed that the parent attempted to contact the children, sent them gifts, and provided child support payments. State Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Roe (In the Interest of Doe), 139 Idaho 18, 72 P.3d 858 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and competent evidence supported the trial court’s conclusion that the father neglected his child where he failed to provide the parental care necessary for the child’s health, morals, and well-being; the trial court properly considered relevant evidence about the father’s behavior and treatment of his son, he was granted visitation rights with his child, and the father’s visitation with his child was sporadic and infrequent and the father also failed to provide for his child’s health insurance or medical costs. Roe v. Doe (In re Termination of the Parental Rights of Doe), 142 Idaho 174, 125 P.3d 530 (2005).
    Father’s parental rights were properly terminated on grounds of neglect, where the father actively encouraged the child’s mother to take drugs and findings about his parenting skills were supported by substantial competent evidence; the father failed to provide care and it was in the child’s best interests for his rights to be terminated. Casi Found., Inc. v. Doe (In re Doe), 142 Idaho 397, 128 P.3d 934 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the father neglected his daughter, and, therefore, the magistrate judge properly terminated the father’s parental rights; the father’s neglect, violence and drinking had a highly detrimental effect and there was no point in further considering reunification. State v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 144 P.3d 597 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate’s finding that a mother neglected her children was supported by substantial and competent evidence where the mother had been completely noncompliant with her case plan until her release from incarceration, and, upon release, the mother merely complied with the terms of her probation rather than the terms of her case plan, and there were several enumerated specific instances of neglect. State v. Doe (In re Doe), 145 Idaho 662, 182 P.3d 1196 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order terminating a mother’s parental rights to her five children under subdivision (1)(b) was proper because she had neglected her children within the meaning of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c20s16-2002" target="_self">§ 16-2002</a></cite>(3)(b) by her failure to comply with her case plan, her failure to maintain safe, stable and adequate housing, and her ongoing relationship with a convicted sex offender. State v. Doe, 149 Idaho 409, 234 P.3d 733 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the magistrate’s decision that termination was proper because the mother and father neglected the children by failing to comply with their case plan and by failing to provide proper care and control, given that: (1) the children had been seen unsupervised, (2) the mother and father had inconsistent compliance with their case plan, (3) they did not provide child support or maintain regular phone contact with the children, (4) all the witnesses were in agreement as to the inadequate and unstable living conditions and lack of improvement by the mother and father, and (5) the mother and father were unwilling or unable to provide the care and stability the children needed. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 149 Idaho 564, 237 P.3d 661 (Ct. App. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights to her children was proper, because the magistrate court specifically found neglect on the grounds that the mother and her husband had failed to comply with their case plan by not: (1) providing Idaho department of health and welfare with a schedule of household chores, (2) completing a food safety course, (3) cooperating with visits from the department, (4) contacting a psychosocial rehabilitation agency, (5) following the recommendation in her psychological evaluation, (6) completing an 18-week parenting course, (7) writing out a list of developmental tasks for each child, and (8) coming up with a budget. Doe v. Doe, 150 Idaho 36, 244 P.3d 180 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights under paragraph (1)(b), because he neglected his child by conduct or omission, which caused the child to be without proper parental care and control, subsistence, medical, or other care or control. The father had not expressed a genuine interest in learning about the child’s special needs, let alone how to care for those needs on a daily basis. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 152 Idaho 644, 273 P.3d 685 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, substantial evidence supported the finding that appellant mother neglected her children by failing to comply with her case plan that had been prepared to set forth reasonable efforts that would make it possible for the children to return to appellant’s home. Appellant failed to maintain safe housing and employment as required by the case plan, did not demonstrate adequate parenting skills, and resisted her caseworkers’ suggestions for improvement. In re Doe, 152 Idaho 910, 277 P.3d 357 (2012).
    Termination of the mother’s parental rights on grounds of neglect under paragraph (1)(b) was proper, because the mother failed to comply with the case plan in areas of substance abuse and mental health and the mother never provided verification of full-time employment or adequate housing. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 152 Idaho 953, 277 P.3d 400 (Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate’s finding of neglect under paragraph (1)(b) was supported by clear and convincing evidence, where the father had failed to comply with the case plan and the court orders that were entered in the child protection act case, and he was unable to provide proper parental care and control for the child’s well-being. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 154 Idaho 175, 296 P.3d 381 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights based upon neglect was proper and in the best interest of the child, where substantial evidence was presented at the termination hearing regarding the mother’s criminal history and drug use, her history with her other children, her general ability to support a child, and her insufficient efforts to comply with the case plan. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 145, 306 P.3d 230 (Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother failed to show that the trial court erred in finding neglect; in part, the mother failed to get her children to school and counseling sessions and did not provide financial support; and, it was hard to find any area of parental responsibility that the mother consistently met. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 156 Idaho 103, 320 P.3d 1262 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Willfulness is not necessary to a finding of neglect, as father’s incarceration, long history of addiction and failed treatment, and failure to maintain stable housing or employment were properly considered in determining that he had neglected his child. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 158 Idaho 764, 351 P.3d 1222 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err in terminating a mother’s parental rights because the evidence was substantial and competent support for its finding of neglect; the mother’s return with her child to live with the father after discovering his sexual abuse of the child’s older sister exemplified her inability to prioritize the child’s well-being over her own relationships, and her missed urinalysis tests and arrests reflected her general inability to care for the child. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 160 Idaho 154, 369 P.3d 932 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s decision to terminate the father’s parental rights was supported by substantial and competent evidence, where the child had been in state custody for 15 of 22 months, reunification had not been accomplished, and the father failed to meet the requirement for clean drug testing. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 161 Idaho 660, 389 P.3d 946 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court correctly found that a mother failed to follow her case plan and was unable to discharge her parental responsibilities, establishing neglect. The mother’s recent and modest improvements were insufficient to overcome her history of demonstrated unfitness. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 161 Idaho 754, 390 P.3d 1281 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper on the basis of neglect because, despite the mother’s recent progress, she had longstanding history of drug abuse and relapses and neglectful conduct: one of the children was seriously injured in an automobile accident due to the mother driving while under the influence; she used drugs while pregnant or while the children were in her care; she had failed to provide stable and safe housing for her children; and she was not a consistent presence in the children’s lives, as she had been absent because of drug usage, because the care of the children was overwhelming to her, and because of incarceration. Idaho Dep’t of Health v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 162 Idaho 69, 394 P.3d 112 (Ct. App. 2017).
    There was substantial and competent evidence in the record supporting the magistrate court’s determination that the mother’s compliance with the case plan was not impossible and the court’s order terminating her parental rights to the child for neglect, including evidence that the mother, who was incarcerated, committed 13 disciplinary offenses after the child was removed from the home and that she failed to complete a therapeutic community program. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 380, 397 P.3d 1139 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s decision to terminate a father’s parental rights based on neglect was supported by substantial and competent evidence, because the father neglected his child, provided no excuse for failing to provide financial support, and provided no explanation for his failure to try to make efforts to visit with his child or to return to the court to enforce the order allowing him visitation. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 653, 402 P.3d 1106 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court had substantial and competent evidence to terminate the mother’s parental rights on the ground of neglect, where she failed to point to any evidence supporting her statement that she participated in the case plan, she failed to complete several of the tasks outlined in the plan, she was unable to protect the children from the father, and her mental and physical conditions impaired her ability to parent. Idaho Dept. of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 163 Idaho 367, 413 P.3d 767 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights was appropriate because the parents neglected their children and were unlikely to make the permanent changes necessary to properly care for the children, as the mother showed an inability to parent due to mental and substance abuse issues, the father failed to comply with his case plan, the children were in foster care for the required period without reunification being accomplished, and the father was unable to provide the parental care necessary for the children’s health, safety, and well-being. Dep’t of Health And Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 437 P.3d 33 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a father’s parental rights was appropriate, because there was substantial, competent evidence supporting the magistrate court’s finding that the father neglected the father’s children, as he failed to complete his case plan. Despite periods of incarceration, which the magistrate court properly considered, the father was responsible, whether directly or indirectly, for non-compliance with the requirements of the case plan. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 164 Idaho 875, 436 P.3d 1224 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on neglect was proper because, although the mother challenged the magistrate court’s finding of neglect based on her failure to complete her case plan, the mother did not challenge the additional bases upon which the magistrate court found the mother neglected the child; and the court found neglect on the additional bases of the mother’s continued methamphetamine use, periods of incarceration, and probation violations. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), — Idaho —, 437 P.3d 922 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err in determining that the mother neglected a child, where the finding was based upon the developmental delays shown in the child and his malnourishment that occurred between his first and second placements in foster care.

        Where the state’s petition made reference to the father’s failure to comply with the agreement for reuniting the family, the father’s failure to cooperate in providing care and a stable home environment for the child, and the state’s belief that the best interests of the child would be served by terminating the father’s parental rights, the father was provided adequate notice that the state was seeking to terminate his parental rights.

        Although it was uncontroverted that the mother loved the child, that was not enough to permit continued custody where a caseworker testified that she did not feel the mother was capable of safely and effectively parenting the child, that the mother had not established a connection with the child and that no purpose would be served with additional time or services. The goals of permanency and the needs of the child were not met by preserving the mother’s parental rights with the hope she could someday be capable of caring for the child.

       <p>
        Grounds for termination of parental rights must be shown by clear and convincing evidence, because each parent has a fundamental liberty interest in maintaining a relationship with his or her child. Clear and convincing evidence is generally understood to be evidence indicating that the thing to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 236, 395 P.3d 1269 (2017). Termination Improper.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where termination order was conditional; as it terminated the mother’s parental rights only in favor of the adoptive parents, it was invalid. Doe v. Roe, 127 Idaho 452, 902 P.2d 477 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a child was out of the mother’s care for 18 of the last 22 months, despite its reluctance, the department of health and welfare was obligated under the law to file a petition for termination of parental rights, but, the magistrate court’s order terminating the mother’s parental rights was clearly erroneous. The magistrate erred in focusing on the mother’s conviction and past criminal behavior while dismissing relevant and competent evidence such as the social worker’s testimony and that reunification was possible and was occurring. State v. Roe (In re Doe), 142 Idaho 594, 130 P.3d 1132 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The magistrate court placed excessive emphasis upon father’s admittedly abhorrent behavior prior to the removal of the children from his home, and upon minor noncompliance with reporting requirements that had not been in effect for half a year prior to the termination hearing, while disregarding or giving minimal attention to the compelling evidence of father’s success in overcoming alcoholism, complying with treatment requirements, maintaining remunerative employment, and becoming a nurturing parent with whom the children had developed a strong bond. The evidentiary record does not provide objectively supportable grounds for the trial court’s decision that termination of father’s parental rights was in the best interests of the children. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 150 Idaho 752, 250 P.3d 803 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and competent evidence did not support a finding that termination of parental rights was in the child’s best interest, where the parents were able to provide a beneficial environment that was responsive to child’s needs. That ability was especially important given that the child was in a residential treatment facility after sexually assaulting his younger sister, and there was no expert testimony that the child’s medical, physical, or emotional condition foreclosed his reentry into the parents’ home.

        A magistrate correctly ordered the parent-child relationship terminated based on his findings that (1) the mother had physically abused the child; (2) the mother had neglected the child; (3) the mother and her husband had been dishonest with the department of health and welfare and had attempted to cover up their physical abuse of the child; (4) the parents’ prognosis for improving their parenting ability was poor; and (5) the child had bonded with her foster mother and would experience trauma and further developmental delay if she were removed from her foster mother’s care. Rhodes v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 107 Idaho 1120, 695 P.2d 1259 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where father had neglected his children, failed to provide adequate voluntary support and had no realistic plans for their care, the magistrate court determined father had neglected and abused his children and that it was in the best interest of the children that his parental rights be terminated. Tanner v. State Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 120 Idaho 606, 818 P.2d 310 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The facts indicated that when under the mother’s care, children were in an unstable, unnurturing and dangerous environment; therefore, the trial court found sufficient evidence to support termination of the mother’s parental rights based on the conclusion that she had neglected the children and that the children’s best interests would be served by termination. Doe v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 122 Idaho 644, 837 P.2d 319 (Ct. App. 1992).
    Substantial evidence supported court’s decision to terminate father’s parental rights upon a finding of abandonment. The mother presented evidence that he had no contact with the minor child for over two years, he stated he wasn’t ready to start raising a family, and he gave no support to the minor child apart from an isolated gift. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 138 Idaho 893, 71 P.3d 1040 (2003).
       </p>

        Court determined that biological father had no cognizable parental rights, where he had not had his paternity established by court decree, he had never filed an acknowledgement of paternity with vital statistics, he had not filed an acknowledgement of paternity, commenced paternity proceedings, or provided any monetary support toward the mother’s pregnancy, he was clearly aware of the strong possibility that he was the child’s father, particularly when the child was born nine months after he had engaged in sexual relations with the mother, and he had done nothing to affirmatively establish a relationship with the child. Doe v. Roe (In re Doe), 142 Idaho 202, 127 P.3d 105 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the father (who was incarcerated for lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor under 16 for his conduct with his adopted daughter) and his biological daughter shared a genuinely loving relationship, termination of the parent-child relationship was in the daughter’s best interest as she would be well supported by her maternal great-aunt, would benefit from a sense of finality and comparative normalcy and permanency following termination and her pending adoption, and would be entitled to public financial benefits following the adoption. Termination was also in the father’s best “psychological” interest in order to bring him closure and help him push past his delusions and seek the help he needed in psycho-sexual treatment. State v. Doe, 143 Idaho 383, 146 P.3d 649 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support a magistrate’s decision to terminate a mother’s parental rights in her child. Although the mother’s case plan required her to complete substance abuse counseling, the mother did not enter counseling until over three years later, after the termination trial had begun. In re Doe, 148 Idaho 124, 219 P.3d 448 (2009).
       </p>

        Under paragraph (1)(d) of this section, the district court did not err in terminating the mother’s parental rights, as it was supported by substantial, competent evidence; the fact that the mother demonstrated that she had improved in her ability to pay attention to her children did not undermine the lower court’s finding that the mother was unable to carry out her parental responsibilities and this inability would be injurious to the health, morals, and well-being of the children. Idaho Dep. of Health and Welfare v. Doe (In re Child I), 149 Idaho 165, 233 P.3d 96 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father’s parental rights were properly terminated where court found that father had neglected his child by failing to comply with the court’s orders in a case plan, by failing to reunify with his son within fifteen of the last twenty-two months, and by failing to demonstrate consistency in housing, employment, and/or abstinence from controlled substances, impairing his ability to provide proper parental care. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In the Interest of Doe), 149 Idaho 401, 234 P.3d 725 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because she could not independently parent the child in the future based on the degenerative and incurable nature of her multiple sclerosis, her physical and mental impairments could be injurious to the child, and termination was in child’s best interests. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 153 Idaho 700, 291 P.3d 39 (2012).
    Evidence was sufficient to support the termination of the father’s parental rights, where, because of the father’s ongoing incarceration, his alcohol abuse, and his violent and controlling behaviors, he was unable to discharge his parental responsibilities for a prolonged period, and this inability to parent was injurious to his child. Doe v. Doe, 159 Idaho 192, 358 P.3d 77 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support the termination of the father’s parental rights, where he failed to provide evidence that his murder conviction was on appeal or reason to believe that his conviction would be overturned, other than his conclusory opinion. Doe v. Doe, 159 Idaho 192, 358 P.3d 77 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial evidence to support the termination of a father’s parental rights based on neglect and abuse. He failed to provide for the well-being of his children, as he did not complete counseling services, did not actively participate in parenting classes, and did not intervene when his children were being abused by his spouse. Further, the father’s inability to discharge parental responsibilities had been ongoing for years. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe Children), 159 Idaho 664, 365 P.3d 420 (Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support the termination of the mother’s parental rights based on her inability to discharge parental responsibilities, where it showed that she failed to secure court approved housing, complete drug treatment, make progress on her GED, or secure stable employment, and that she struggled with drug use and admitted she was addicted to methamphetamine, she was charged with felony drug crimes, and she struggled with her visitations with the children. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 160 Idaho 824, 379 P.3d 1094 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a parental rights termination case, substantial and competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s finding that a father was likely to remain incarcerated for a substantial period of time during his sons’ minority and supported the court’s conclusion that termination of the father’s parental rights was in the best interests of his children. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 162 Idaho 266, 396 P.3d 695 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights. The magistrate court’s finding that the father sexually abused his oldest daughter and would be incarcerated for a majority of the childhood years of his other children was supported by substantial and competent evidence. In re Termination of the Parental Rights of Doe, 162 Idaho 280, 396 P.3d 1162 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court did not err in terminating a mother’s parental rights. The mother did not challenge the magistrate court’s finding she was not able to provide the care and control necessary for the children’s well-being and she had done nothing to protect her children from the abuse of their father. In re Termination of the Parental Rights of Doe, 162 Idaho 280, 396 P.3d 1162 (2017).

        This section was amended by two 2005 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2005 amendment, by ch. 25, corrected a citation in present subsection (6).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2005 amendment, by ch. 291, made the same correction as in ch. 25, and extensively rewrote the section, adding the subsection designations and the form in subsection (3).
    The 2013 amendment, by ch. 138, rewrote the last sentence of subsection (5), which formerly read: “Where the putative father has failed to timely commence proceedings to establish paternity under section 7-1111, Idaho Code, and by filing with the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare, notice of his commencement of proceedings to establish his paternity of the child born out of wedlock, notice under this section is not required unless such putative father is one of those persons specifically set forth in section 16-1505(1), Idaho Code.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2020 amendment, by ch. 330, substituted “section 16-1504(6), Idaho Code” for “section 16-1504(5), Idaho Code” near the beginning of the third sentence in subsection (5).

        In circumstances where the father and the mother both acknowledge who the biological father is and the father is willing to accept the rights and responsibilities of paternity, the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c20s16-2007" target="_self">§§ 16-2007 </a></cite>and 16-1505 apply; if, on the other hand, the mother does not join in the acknowledgment of paternity, then the father is required to follow the mandates of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1513" target="_self">§ 16-1513 </a></cite>and file proceedings for paternity and a notice with the bureau of vital records and health statistics.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where putative father never commenced paternity proceedings before the department of health and welfare petitioned to terminate mother’s parental rights, the magistrate judge correctly held that father was not even entitled to notice of a hearing on a petition by the department requesting an Order of Non-Establishment of Parental Rights. The magistrate’s decision is reversible only if father can show that his due process rights were violated. Doe v. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 36, 304 P.3d 1202 (2013).

        It was error to terminate a biological father’s parental rights based on his failure to file and register his notice of commencement of paternity proceedings under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t16c15s16-1513" target="_self">§ 16-1513</a></cite>, because the father and mother had filled out and had notarized a paternity affidavit requesting that he be listed as the father on the child’s birth certificate; it was, therefore unnecessary for him to file a paternity action, he was the biological father of the child and, pursuant to this section, he was entitled to have had notice of the termination hearing.

       If a petition for adoption is not filed in conjunction with a petition for termination, or the petition for termination was not filed by a children’s adoption agency licensed by the state of Idaho upon the filing of a petition for termination, the court shall direct the department of health and welfare, bureau of child support services, to submit a written financial analysis report within thirty (30) days from date of notification, detailing the amount of any unreimbursed public assistance moneys paid by the state of Idaho on behalf of the child. The financial analysis shall include recommendations regarding repayment of unreimbursed public assistance and provisions for future support for the child and the reasons therefor.

       Upon the filing of a petition, the court may direct, in all cases where written consent to termination has not been given as provided in this chapter, that an investigation be made by the department of health and welfare, division of family and community services, or a licensed children’s adoption agency, and that a report in writing of such study be submitted to the court prior to the hearing, except that where the department of health and welfare or a licensed children’s adoption agency is a petitioner, either in its own right or on behalf of a parent, a report in writing of the investigation made by such agency shall accompany the petition. The department of health and welfare or the licensed children’s adoption agency shall have thirty (30) days from notification by the court during which it shall complete and submit its investigation unless an extension of time is granted by the court upon application by the agency. The court may order additional investigation as it deems necessary. The social study shall include the circumstances of the petition, the investigation, the present condition of the child and parents, proposed plans for the child, and such other facts as may be pertinent to the parent and child relationship, and the report submitted shall include a recommendation and the reasons therefor as to whether or not the parent and child relationship should be terminated. If the parent has a disability as defined in this chapter, the parent shall have the right, as a part of the social study, to provide information regarding the manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will enable the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child. The person performing the social investigation shall advise the parent of such right and shall consider all such information in any findings or recommendations. The social study shall be conducted by, or with the assistance of, an individual with expertise in the use of such equipment and services. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any new or additional obligations on state or local governments to purchase or provide adaptive equipment or supportive services for parents with disabilities. Where the parent is a minor, if the report does not include a statement of contact with the parents of said minor, the reasons therefor shall be set forth. The purpose of the investigation is to aid the court in making disposition of the petition and shall be considered by the court prior thereto.

       <p>
        Whether neglect has occurred is a question of fact, to be determined in the first instance by the trial judge upon a constitutionally mandated standard of clear and convincing evidence; when neglect has been found upon this standard, the judge’s finding — like any finding of fact — is reviewable upon the appellate standard of substantial evidence. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Cheatwood, 108 Idaho 218, 697 P.2d 1232 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in an action to terminate parental rights, the burden of proving neglect by clear and convincing evidence has been noted explicitly and applied by the trial judge, the appellate court will not disturb the trial court’s findings unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court finds that abandonment is established by clear and convincing evidence, those findings will not be overturned on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous; clear error will not be deemed to exist where the findings are supported by substantial and competent, albeit conflicting, evidence. Crum v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 111 Idaho 407, 725 P.2d 112 (1986); State v. Doe, 149 Idaho 409, 234 P.3d 733 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        A parent-child relationship may be terminated by the court when it finds that the parent has neglected or abused the child, or that termination is found to be in the best interests of the parent and child; on appeal the supreme court will not disturb those findings, if they are supported by substantial and competent evidence.

        While the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure allows an entry of default in a termination proceeding, it does not permit the entry of judgment (a decree terminating parental rights) against the non-appearing party unless the Idaho department of health and welfare has established the grounds for termination and the court finds termination is in the best interest of the child by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, there was no substantial and competent evidence to support a termination where the Idaho department of health and welfare did not seek to admit evidence, and the decree indicated that the trial court’s decision was based upon review of the file.

        In determining whether the procedure followed in a parental rights termination proceeding satisfied the constitutional requirements of due process the criteria of Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, consideration of three factors is mandated: 1. the private interest that will be affected by the official action; 2. the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and 3. the government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.

        Counsel’s decision not to call the mother to the stand and his option to argue rehabilitation rather than lack of evidence to support a finding of abuse were tactical decisions, and strategic and tactical decisions of counsel do not sustain a charge of ineffective counsel.

       <p>
        In a proceeding to terminate a parent-child relationship, evidence showing that the father had been unable to hold steady employment because of chronic alcoholism which resulted in numerous convictions for public intoxication as well as burglary was held to be sufficient to support a judgment of termination under this section when considered in conjunction with a finding that the mother of the children was incapable of providing her children with moral guidance, training, and support. State ex rel. Child v. Clouse, 93 Idaho 893, 477 P.2d 834 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the children’s behavior and school work generally improved while they were living away from the mother, the children themselves told the judge that they felt insecure at their mother’s home and did not want to live there, and the caseworker stated that the children needed a permanent, stable living arrangement that the mother had been unable to provide, the magistrate’s finding that termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests was supported by substantial evidence and had to be sustained on appeal. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
    Where the mother failed to provide the parental care necessary for the children’s health, morals and well-being, the magistrate’s finding that the mother had neglected her daughters was supported by substantial evidence and would not be disturbed. Hofmeister v. Bauer, 110 Idaho 960, 719 P.2d 1220 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a slightly mentally retarded mother’s parental rights to her two children would be upheld in view of evidence that the children were abused, neglected, and abandoned, that because of the mother’s inability or lack of desire, there appeared to be little or no chance of improvement in conditions for the children, and that the mother, although she expressed love for her children, was barely able to provide basic care for herself, let alone her children. Brown v. State, 112 Idaho 901, 736 P.2d 1355 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated, because substantial, competent evidence supported the magistrate court’s decision that the mother had willfully failed to maintain a normal parental relationship with the child, as she failed to contact the child for over a year, even though at times she was geographically close to him, and, even when she eventually was in contact with him under the visitation stipulation, her visits were sporadic. Doe v. Doe (In re Doe), 155 Idaho 505, 314 P.3d 187 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and competent evidence did not support a finding that termination of parental rights was in the child’s best interest, where the parents were able to provide a beneficial environment that was responsive to child’s needs. That ability was especially important given that the child was in a residential treatment facility after sexually assaulting his younger sister, and there was no expert testimony that the child’s medical, physical, or emotional condition foreclosed his reentry into the parents’ home. Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Doe (In re Doe), 163 Idaho 83, 408 P.3d 81 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate court’s finding that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests based on neglect was supported by substantial, competent evidence, where the mother was unable to provide a stable and permanent home for child; there was ample evidence that the child improved under foster care, and the mother demonstrated a consistent inability to care for the child.

        This section, since the 1983 amendment, requires that at least one of the grounds for terminating parental rights be proved by clear and convincing evidence; even though this requirement was not a part of the statute until 1983, parental rights could not be terminated on a lesser standard because of due process requirements of the United States Constitution.

        Where the father was in prison when his child was born and had never seen his child or provided financial support for him, but, after learning of the child’s birth, he sent the child several Christmas gifts, tried to speak with the child’s mother and maternal grandmother, wrote to the grandmother without receiving a response, signed documents authorizing medical treatment for the child, contacted the caseworker a number of times, and wrote a letter to the magistrate court indicating that he did not want his parental rights terminated, and the mother’s parental rights were already terminated, the father’s failure to complete the “rider” program after the child was born and get out of prison early was not substantial competent evidence that supported a finding by clear and convincing evidence of abandonment; the father’s efforts to maintain a relationship with the child had to be judged in terms of the reality of his imprisonment and not trivialized.

        While it was true that defendant’s legal rights, privileges and obligations toward his child ceased if his parental rights were terminated, the district court’s directive to pay restitution in the form of child support was a condition of probation in a criminal case; thus, to determine its validity, the appellate court need only consider whether the order was reasonably related to the purpose of probation and rehabilitation.

      It is hereby found and declared: (1) that the needs of children requiring placement and of adults seeking to receive them cannot be met by restricting child placement services and supervision to the territory of a single state; (2) that the cooperation of this state with other states is necessary to improve services and protection for children in need of placement.

      It shall therefore be the policy of this state, in adopting the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, to cooperate fully with other states: (1) in furnishing public authorities in a receiving state with notice of the intention to place a child in the receiving state; (2) in placing a child in a receiving state only after receiving notification from that receiving state as to suitability of the placement; and (3) in conforming with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.

       <li id="t16c24s16-2402ol11">
        It is the policy of the legislature and the state of Idaho that services for children with serious emotional disturbance should be planned and implemented to maximize the support of the family’s ability to provide adequate safety and well-being for the child at home. If the child cannot receive adequate services within the family home to maintain individual safety and well-being, community resources shall be provided to minimize the need for institutional or other residential placement. The legislature finds that family involvement and participation in the child’s treatment planning and implementation is vital to successful intervention for children with serious emotional disturbance.
       </li>
       <li id="t16c24s16-2402ol12">
        Services to address mental health needs are one part of a broad array of services which should be available to Idaho’s children with special needs. Such services shall maximize the preservation of the family, by coordination and collaboration of services with schools and community. The department of health and welfare, the department of education, the department of juvenile corrections, school districts, counties and any other appropriate entities, shall cooperate and collaborate in planning, developing and providing services, and shall consult with counties and private providers of mental health services.
       </li>
       <li id="t16c24s16-2402ol13">
        Services shall be individually planned to meet the unique needs of each child and family. Such planning shall include the parent, guardian or surrogate parent(s) of each child. The continuum of services shall include, but not be limited to, individual and family counseling, crisis intervention services, day treatment, respite care, therapeutic foster homes, family support services, residential treatment and inpatient services. These services shall be available to meet the needs of Idaho’s children with serious emotional disturbance or mental illness and their families. Services shall be provided without requiring that parents relinquish custody of the child.

      </h3>

       <li id="t16c24s16-2411ol11">
        A peace officer may take a child into protective custody and immediately transport the child to a treatment facility for emergency mental health evaluation in the absence of a court order if and only if the officer determines that an emergency situation exists as defined in this chapter, and the officer has probable cause to believe, based on personal observation and investigation, representation of the child’s parents or the recommendation of a mental health professional, that the child is suffering from serious emotional disturbance as a result of which he is likely to cause harm to himself or others or is manifestly unable to preserve his health or safety with the supports and assistance available to him and that immediate detention and treatment is necessary to prevent harm to the child or others.
       </li>
       <li id="t16c24s16-2411ol12">
        For purposes of this section, “health care professional” means a physician, physician’s assistant or advanced practice registered nurse, any one (1) of whom then is practicing in a hospital. A health care professional may detain a child if such person determines that an emergency situation exists as defined in this chapter, and such person has probable cause to believe that the child is suffering from a serious emotional disturbance as a result of which he is likely to cause harm to himself or others or is manifestly unable to preserve his health or safety with the supports and assistance available to him and that immediate detention and treatment is necessary to prevent harm to the child or others. If the hospital does not have an appropriate facility to provide emergency mental health care, it may cause the child to be transported to an appropriate treatment facility. The health care professional shall notify the parent or legal guardian, if known, as soon as possible and shall document in the patient’s chart the efforts to contact the parent or legal guardian. If the parent or legal guardian cannot be located or contacted, the health care professional shall cause a report to be filed as soon as possible and in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours with the Idaho department of health and welfare or an appropriate law enforcement agency. The child may not be detained against the parent or legal guardian’s explicit direction unless the child is taken into protective custody pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, except that the child may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary for a peace officer to be summoned to the hospital to make a determination under subsection (1) of this section.
       </li>
       <li id="t16c24s16-2411ol13">
        If a child has been taken into protective custody by a peace officer under the provisions of this section, the officer shall immediately transport the child to a treatment facility or mental health program, such as a regional mental health center, a mobile crisis intervention program, or a therapeutic foster care facility, provided such center’s program or facility has been approved by the regional office of the department for that purpose. The department shall make a list of approved facilities available to law enforcement agencies.
       </li>
       <li id="t16c24s16-2411ol14">
        Upon taking the child into protective custody or detaining the child pursuant to this section, the officer or health care professional shall take reasonable precautions to safeguard and preserve the personal property of the child unless a parent or guardian or responsible relative is able to do so. Upon presenting a child to a treatment facility, the officer shall inform the staff in writing of the facts that caused him to detain the child and shall specifically state whether the child is otherwise subject to being held for juvenile or criminal offenses.
    (5) If the child who is being detained by a peace officer is not released to the child’s parent, guardian or custodian, the law enforcement agency shall contact the child’s parent, guardian or custodian as soon as possible, and in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours, and shall notify the child’s parent, guardian or custodian of his status, location and the reasons for the detention of the child. If the parents cannot be located or contacted, efforts to comply with this section and the reasons for failure to make contact shall be documented in the child’s record.
