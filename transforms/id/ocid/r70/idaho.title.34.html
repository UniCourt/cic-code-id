The provisions of this bill will achieve a significant consolidation of elections on four (4) election dates in each year. In addition, this election code, which applies to the various political subdivisions of the state of Idaho, will assure access to the nominating process, registration of potential electors, absentee voting opportunity and an increased visibility of the electoral process to assure public access and increased participation. At a future date, it may be warranted to further consolidate elections as events demonstrate that need. The goal of providing increased visibility for the electoral process will be well served by this consolidation of elections, by the increased public notice of filing and election deadlines, and the public education which will accompany the implementation of this act.”

      The secretary of state is the chief election officer of this state, and it is his responsibility to obtain and maintain uniformity in the application, operation and interpretation of the election laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The secretary of state is responsible for providing information regarding voter registration procedures and absentee ballot procedures to be used by absent uniformed service voters and overseas voters with respect to elections for federal office as required by section 102 of the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act (42 U.S.C. section 1973 et seq.).
     </p>
     <p>
      If a national or local emergency or other situation arises which makes substantial compliance with the provisions of the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act impossible or unreasonable, such as a natural disaster or an armed conflict involving United States armed forces, mobilization of those forces, including state national guard and reserve components of this state, the secretary of state may prescribe, by directive, such special procedures or requirements as may be necessary to facilitate absentee voting by those citizens directly affected who otherwise are eligible to vote in this state.

      The county clerk shall, upon receipt of a written request, such request to be received no later than twelve (12) days prior to the day of election, direct that the election judges permit one (1) person authorized by each political party, if the election is a partisan election, to be at the polling place for the purpose of challenging voters, and shall, if requested, permit any one (1) person authorized by a candidate, several candidates or political party, to be present to serve as a watcher to observe the conduct of the election. Such authorization shall be evidenced by a writing signed by the county chairman and secretary of the political party, if the election is a partisan election, or by the candidate or candidates, and filed with the county clerk. Where the issue before the electors is other than the election of officers, the clerk shall, upon receipt of a written request, such request to be received no later than twelve (12) days prior to the date of voting on the issue or issues, direct that the election judges permit one (1) pro and one (1) con person to be at the polling place for the purpose of challenging voters and to observe the conduct of the election. Such authorization shall be evidenced in writing signed by the requesting person and shall state which position relative to the issue or issues the person represents. Persons who are authorized to serve as challengers or watchers shall wear a visible name tag which includes their respective titles. A watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving, provided however, that the watcher does not interfere with the orderly conduct of the election. If the watchers are present at the polling place when ballots are counted they shall not absent themselves until the polls are closed. A watcher serving at a central counting station may be present at any time the station is open for the purpose of processing or preparing to process election results and until the election officers complete their duties at the station. If the county clerk does not receive the list of names of those desired to be present for the purpose of either poll watching or challenging within the time prescribed above, the clerk shall not allow the presence of such persons later seeking to serve in those capacities.

        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 70, rewrote the section, which formerly read: “The county clerk shall, upon receipt of a written request, such request to be received no later than five (5) days prior to the day of election, direct that the election judges permit one (1) person authorized by each political party to be at the polling place for the purpose of challenging voters, and shall, if requested, permit any candidate, or one (1) person authorized by a candidate, several candidates or political party, to be present to watch the receiving and counting of the votes. Such authorization shall be evidenced by a writing signed by the county chairman and secretary of the political party, or by the candidate or candidates, and filed with the county clerk. If the county clerk does not receive the list of names of those which the parties desire to be present for the purpose of either poll watching or challenging within the time prescribed above, the clerk shall not allow the presence of such persons later seeking to serve in those capacities. Persons who are authorized to serve as challengers or watchers shall wear a visible name tag which includes their respective titles. Persons permitted to be present to watch the counting of the votes shall not absent themselves until the polls are closed.”

        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 341, twice substituted “twelve (12) days” for “five (5) days” and, in the first and second sentences, inserted “if the election is a partisan election.”

The Legislature finds that it is the public policy of this state to encourage voter participation in primary and general elections. While each political party may select that party’s candidates in primary elections, it is the intent of the Legislature that every effort be made to accommodate the participation of voters who are unaffiliated with a particular political party, but who are willing to affiliate with a party for purposes of voting in primary elections. The Legislature also finds, as noted by the United States Supreme Court, that the state may not deprive a political party of its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to enter into political association with individuals of its own choosing. Consequently, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide political parties in this state with a mechanism to voluntarily and more fully exercise those rights of political association by providing certain provisions relating to primary elections.”

       All electors must register before being able to vote at any primary, general, special, school or any other election governed by the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code. Registration of a qualified person occurs when a legible, accurate and complete registration application is received in the office of the county clerk or is received at the polls pursuant to section 34-408A, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c04s34-404ol12">
       Each elector may select on the registration application an affiliation with a political party qualified to participate in elections pursuant to section 34-501, Idaho Code, or may select to be designated as “unaffiliated.” The county clerk shall record the party affiliation or “unaffiliated” designation so selected as part of the elector’s registration record. If an elector shall fail or refuse to make such a selection, the county clerk shall enter on the registration records that such elector is “unaffiliated.”
      </li>
      <li id="t34c04s34-404ol13">
       In order to provide an elector with the appropriate primary election ballot, pursuant to section 34-904A, Idaho Code, the poll book for primary elections shall include the party affiliation or designation as “unaffiliated” for each elector so registered. An “unaffiliated” elector shall declare to the poll worker which primary election ballot the elector chooses to vote in, pursuant to section 34-904A, Idaho Code, and the poll worker or other authorized election personnel shall record such declaration in the poll book. The poll book shall contain checkoff boxes to allow the poll worker or other authorized election personnel to record such “unaffiliated” elector’s selection.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c04s34-404ol14">
       In order to provide electors who are already registered to vote, and who remain registered electors, with an opportunity to select a party affiliation or to select their status as “unaffiliated,” the poll book for the 2012 primary election shall include checkoff boxes by which the poll worker or other appropriate election personnel shall record such elector’s choice of party affiliation or choice to be designated as “unaffiliated.” After the 2012 primary election, the county clerk shall record the party affiliation or “unaffiliated” designation so selected in the poll book as part of such an elector’s record within the voter registration system as provided for in section 34-437A, Idaho Code.

       After the 2012 primary election, electors who remain registered voters and who did not vote in the 2012 primary election or who have not selected party affiliation or who have not selected to be designated as “unaffiliated,” shall be designated as “unaffiliated” and the county clerk shall record that designation for each such elector within the voter registration system as provided for in section 34-437A, Idaho Code.

The Legislature finds that it is the public policy of this state to encourage voter participation in primary and general elections. While each political party may select that party’s candidates in primary elections, it is the intent of the Legislature that every effort be made to accommodate the participation of voters who are unaffiliated with a particular political party, but who are willing to affiliate with a party for purposes of voting in primary elections. The Legislature also finds, as noted by the United States Supreme Court, that the state may not deprive a political party of its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to enter into political association with individuals of its own choosing. Consequently, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide political parties in this state with a mechanism to voluntarily and more fully exercise those rights of political association by providing certain provisions relating to primary elections.”

      <li id="t34c04s34-411Aol11">
       For a primary election, including a presidential primary election, an elector may change such elector’s political party affiliation or become “unaffiliated” by filing a signed form with the county clerk no later than the last day a candidate may file for partisan political office prior to such primary election, as provided for in section 34-704 or 34-732, Idaho Code. An “unaffiliated” elector may affiliate with the party of the elector’s choice by filing a signed form up to and including election day. The application form described in section 34-1002, Idaho Code, shall also be used for this purpose.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c04s34-411Aol12">
       For a primary election, an “unaffiliated” elector may select a political party affiliation only prior to voting in the primary election. An elector may make such selection on or before election day, by declaring such political party affiliation to the poll worker or other appropriate election personnel. The poll worker or other appropriate election personnel shall then record in the poll book the elector’s choice. After the primary election, the county clerk shall record the party affiliation so recorded in the poll book as part of such elector’s record within the voter registration system as provided for in section 34-437A, Idaho Code.

      34-627. Holders of partisan elective office changing political parties.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any holder of a partisan elective office desires to change political parties, the change shall only be effective if the holder files a declaration of intent to change political parties with the election official with whom the holder of the partisan elective office has filed his declaration of candidacy for the office that the holder of the partisan elective office currently holds. After receiving the declaration of intent, the election official shall send a copy of the declaration to the affected political party central committees of both the political party, if any, that the holder of the partisan elective office desires to leave and the political party, if any, that the holder of the partisan elective office desires to join. A holder of a partisan elective office cannot change political parties between the date the holder of partisan elective office files for the primary election through three (3) months after the general election in which the partisan elective office was on the ballot. A holder of a partisan elective office only may change political parties pursuant to this section once per term. The election official shall be authorized to charge a holder of a partisan elective office desiring to change his political party a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fee to defray the election official’s expenses in administering the provisions of this section.

The provisions of this bill will achieve a significant consolidation of elections on four (4) election dates in each year. In addition, this election code, which applies to the various political subdivisions of the state of Idaho, will assure access to the nominating process, registration of potential electors, absentee voting opportunity and an increased visibility of the electoral process to assure public access and increase participation. At a future date, it may be warranted to further consolidate elections as events demonstrate that need. The goal of providing increased visibility for the electoral process will be well served by this consolidation of elections, by the increased public notice of filing and election deadlines, and the public education which will accompany the implementation of this act.”

        The words “this act”, at the end of subsection (1), were added by S.L. 1971, chapter 5, which is codified as<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t34c07s34-703" target="_self">§§ 34-703 </a></cite>to 34-707, 34-2421, and 34-2422. Because these provisions may have been inadvertently omitted from S.L. 1970, chapter 140 (House Bill 555), “this act” may have been meant to refer to that act, which is codified throughout Title 34. Section 1 of S.L. 1971, ch. 5 read:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The purpose of this bill is to correct inadvertent omissions which occurred in the engrossing process after House Bill No. 555 was amended in the House in the Second Regular Session of the Fortieth Idaho Legislature. The bill, a substantial rewrite of the election laws, was initially properly printed. The bill was passed by the House as amended and sent to be engrossed. The engrosser omitted the following material from the bill sent to the Senate. The erroneous bill passed the Senate and was signed by the Governor. The omitted material thus did not become law. The error was later discovered and the code commissioners then compiled the statutes in such a way as to facilitate adding the text which constitute section 2 through 8 of this bill.”

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 1984, ch. 173 read: “Statement of Legislative Findings. The Legislature recognizes that many factors impact decisions regarding legislative apportionment. In adoption of the provisions of this act, the Legislature was cognizant that apportionment is fundamental to good government. In all decisions implemented in this act, certain principles governed. The most important of these was achievement of one person, one vote, as mandated by the federal constitution and interpretations by federal courts. In addition, recognition of county boundaries, creation of compact and contiguous districts, preservation of historical socioeconomic relationships, and recognition of natural topographical barriers weighed heavily upon these deliberations. The Legislature has been particularly aware of the requirements of Section 5, Article III, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho. The necessary balance between principles of the United States Constitution and guarantees of the Idaho Constitution has been placed squarely before the Idaho Legislature. The resulting apportionment, contained herein, is a balance of these and other special criteria, noted in this statement as applicable.
    “In certain districts, there exist such unique conditions, that deviation from the ideal of one person, one vote, seems not only warranted, but mandated. In Legislative District No. 1 composed of Bonner and Boundary Counties, these counties are bounded on three sides by other states and a foreign nation. No other combination of counties is possible which accomplishes representation of these populations. Similarly, Kootenai County, in Districts No. 2 and No. 3, has deviations from the ideal which may exceed the most desirable, but the county is given recognition through two districts entirely within its boundaries. Any combination with other counties would only serve to dilute the representation of Kootenai County as a separate and distinct unit.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Benewah and Shoshone Counties are combined in a district without other counties based upon their traditional ties of economic and social interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Four Legislative Districts, No. 5, No. 6, No. 7 and No. 8, illustrate legislative efforts to minimize deviations when it was possible without diluting representation. A floterial district concept is utilized in this area to achieve the representation to which the population total is entitled. The size of the floterial district is limited, however, to five counties, because inclusion of the ten counties north of the southern Idaho County boundary would create a district so large and cumbersome as to be difficult to represent. The diversity of interests thrown into a single district merely for the achievement of minimal deviation would then negate the legitimate representation of these interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        “District No. 9, which is well below the ideal district size, nevertheless consists of four large and sparsely populated counties. While mathematical purity might be achieved by a combination of these and some northern counties, representation of like interests would be diluted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “District No. 22 is well above the ideal district size, but represents a combination of counties very large in size, and without responsible alternatives. Bounded as it is by two states, Owyhee County with its sparsely populated expanse, warrants special consideration. Any combination of Owyhee County with another county than Elmore, would result in unnecessary and unwarranted dilution of the representation of the other county.
       </p>
       <p>
        “District No. 23, composed of five counties of Butte, Clark, Custer, Jefferson and Lemhi, once again illustrates the problems of size and population density. These counties have natural similarities of economic and social interests. They are bounded by another state on one side and by the natural topographical limitation of a large wilderness area and imposing mountain range on the other. While their interests are similar enough to be amenable to good representation, further division or other combinations would only dilute good representation.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Use of two floterial districts in the southeastern corner of the state achieves better representation because the counties included are similar in their socioeconomic traditions. The size of the resulting districts is not excessive and the similarities of interests would make good representation a reasonable expectation. Further, floterial districts used here make it possible to represent individual counties, thereby maximizing county representation in the Legislature. Only through the use of a floterial district is Bingham County assured the representation to which its population would entitle it.
    “While the concept of one person, one vote, has been preeminent in the accomplishment of this apportionment, another important factor has also been considered, and that is achievement of access to good representation. Each case of deviation from the ideal population size has been considered in light of the special circumstances which might warrant that deviation from the first principle, and the resulting enactment herein contained is a merger of these diverse interests and principles.”

       <p>

        “(4) Neither the state, a political party, nor a candidate has the right to send a particularized political message on the ballot;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) Permitting candidates to convey or place a political message on the ballot by use of a changed name without explanation undermines ballot integrity by transforming the ballot from a means of choosing candidates to a billboard for political advertising;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) To mix names of candidates with apparent political propositions is confusing to voters and will directly affect the integrity of the ballot, cause spoiled ballots due to double votes for the same office and potentially produce a result not intended by voters;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) It is necessary for the purpose of eliminating confusion to clarify the ballot and to advise voters that the vote to be cast is for a person and not a political proposition; and
    “(8) As a result of all of the above, it is appropriate to clarify the ballot with an explanation that voters are casting a vote for a person and not a political proposition.”

Consequently, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide political parties in this state with a mechanism to voluntarily and more fully exercise those rights of political association by providing certain provisions relating to primary elections.”

        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 332, in the second paragraph, in the third sentence, substituted “on the Friday before the election” for “on the day before the election,” in the fourth sentence, added “or other electronic transmission,” and in the last sentence, substituted “ninety-six (96) hours” for “forty-eight (48) hours”; and deleted the second sentence in the third paragraph, which formerly read: “A properly executed federal postcard application (F.P.C.A.), shall be considered as a request for an absent elector’s ballot through the next two (2) regularly scheduled general elections for federal office following receipt of the application.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 319, added “— Primary elections” to the section heading, added subsections (2) through (6), added the subsection designations, and made gender neutral changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 135, deleted “Primary elections” at the end of the section heading; substituted “by notifying the county clerk within ninety-six (96) hours prior to the closing of the polls” for “on the day of election by notifying the county clerk” at the end of the fifth sentence in subsection (7); and inserted “as amended” at the end of the fifth sentence in subsection (8).
    The 2016 amendment, by ch. 137, in subsection (7), substituted “eleventh day before the election” for “sixth day before the election” in the second sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 96, substituted “(UOCAVA, 52 U.S.C. 20301 et seq., as amended)” for “(UOCAVA, 42 U.S.C. 1973 ff, et seq., as amended)” at the end of the first sentence in subsection (8).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2020 amendment, by ch. 286, deleted the former last two sentences in subsection (7), which read: “In the event a registered elector is unable to vote in person at the elector’s designated polling place on the day of election because of an emergency situation that rendered the elector physically unable, the elector may nevertheless apply for an absent elector’s ballot by notifying the county clerk within ninety-six (96) hours prior to the closing of the polls. No person may, however, be entitled to vote under an emergency situation unless the situation claimed rendered the elector physically unable to vote at the elector’s designated polling place within ninety-six (96) hours prior to the closing of the polls.” See<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t34c10s34-1002A" target="_self">§ 34-1002A</a></cite> for present comparable provisions.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2011, ch. 319 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature finds that it is the public policy of this state to encourage voter participation in primary and general elections. While each political party may select that party’s candidates in primary elections, it is the intent of the Legislature that every effort be made to accommodate the participation of voters who are unaffiliated with a particular political party, but who are willing to affiliate with a party for purposes of voting in primary elections. The Legislature also finds, as noted by the United States Supreme Court, that the state may not deprive a political party of its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to enter into political association with individuals of its own choosing. Consequently, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide political parties in this state with a mechanism to voluntarily and more fully exercise those rights of political association by providing certain provisions relating to primary elections.”

        Section 1 of S.L. 2011, ch. 319 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature finds that it is the public policy of this state to encourage voter participation in primary and general elections. While each political party may select that party’s candidates in primary elections, it is the intent of the Legislature that every effort be made to accommodate the participation of voters who are unaffiliated with a particular political party, but who are willing to affiliate with a party for purposes of voting in primary elections. The Legislature also finds, as noted by the United States Supreme Court, that the state may not deprive a political party of its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to enter into political association with individuals of its own choosing. Consequently, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide political parties in this state with a mechanism to voluntarily and more fully exercise those rights of political association by providing certain provisions relating to primary elections.”

        Where a voter places a cross in the square opposite a blank space on a ballot instead of opposite the name of any candidate, without writing a name in the blank space, his vote for that particular office is void; but where a voter makes a straight mark, instead of a cross, in the square opposite the name of a candidate for a certain office, such mark is sufficient to indicate his intention to vote for that candidate so that his vote may be counted, unless there is evidence that he used the mark to identify his ballot or for any purpose other than to express his intention.

      The board of county commissioners shall canvass the returns of the judicial nominating election at the time the returns of the primary election are canvassed, shall determine, and cause the county clerk to certify to the secretary of state, the result of said judicial nominating election. In such certificate the clerk shall set forth, following the name of each justice of the supreme court and each district judge for whom a successor is to be elected at the general election in that year, the vote received by each person who had declared himself to be, and who had been voted for as, a candidate to succeed such justice or district judge.

     <p>
      If it appears to the state board of canvassers upon the official canvass that at such judicial nominating election any candidate received a majority of all the votes cast for candidates to succeed a particular justice of the supreme court or district judge, said board shall certify to the secretary of state as duly elected to such office the name of the candidate who received such majority and such candidate whose name is so certified shall receive and the secretary of state shall issue and deliver to him a certificate of election to such office and he shall not be required to stand for election at the general election following.

      <p>
       Section 1 of S.L. 1992, ch. 176 read: “It is the finding of the legislature that the process of exercising the elective franchise should be made as accessible as possible for as many citizens as possible. The provisions of this bill will achieve a significant consolidation of elections on four (4) election dates in each year. In addition, this election code, which applies to the various political subdivisions of the state of Idaho, will assure access to the nominating process, registration of potential electors, absentee voting opportunity and an increased visibility of the electoral process to assure public access and increase participation. At a future date, it may be warranted to further consolidate elections as events demonstrate that need. The goal of providing increased visibility for the electoral process will be well served by this consolidation of elections, by the increased public notice of filing and election deadlines, and the public education which will accompany the implementation of this act.”

      If the secretary of state, county clerk, or city clerk, refuses to accept and file any petition for the recall of a public officer with the requisite number of eligible signatures, any citizen may apply within ten (10) business days after such refusal to the district court for a writ of mandamus to compel him to do so.

On a showing that the petition is not legally sufficient, the court may enjoin the secretary of state, county clerk, or city clerk, and all other officers from certifying or printing any official ballot for a recall election. All such suits shall be advanced on the court docket and heard and decided by the court as quickly as possible.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that there have been incidents of fraudulent and misleading practices in soliciting and obtaining signatures on initiative or referendum petitions, or both, that false signatures have been placed upon initiative or referendum petitions, or both, that difficulties have arisen in determining the identity of petition circulators and that substantial danger exists that such unlawful practices will or may continue in the future. In order to prevent and deter such behavior, the legislature determines that it is necessary to provide easy identity to the public of those persons who solicit or obtain signatures on initiative or referendum petitions, or both, and of those persons for whom they are soliciting and obtaining signatures and to inform the public concerning the solicitation and obtaining of such signatures. It is the purpose of the legislature in enacting this act to fulfill the foregoing statement of intent and remedy the foregoing practices.

       In the case of an initiative petition, the person or persons or organization or organizations under whose authority the measure is to be initiated shall propose a funding source for the cost of implementing the measure. The proposed funding source information shall accompany a copy of the initiative when the petition is initially filed with the secretary of state under subsection (1) of this section, and whenever the petition is circulated for signatures, but the proposed funding source information shall not formally be part of the initiative and shall have no binding effect. Upon receipt of the petition and the proposed funding source information, the secretary of state shall immediately transmit a copy of the petition and proposed funding source information to the division of financial management so that it may issue a statement of fiscal impact as provided in section 34-1812, Idaho Code.

To every sheet of petitioners’ signatures shall be attached a full and correct copy of the measure so proposed by initiative petition and a copy of the fiscal impact statement summary for the initiative, if applicable; but such petition may be filed by the secretary of state in numbered sections for convenience in handling. Every sheet of petitioners’ signatures upon referendum petitions shall be attached to a full and correct copy of the measure on which the referendum is demanded and may be filed in numbered sections in like manner as initiative petitions. Not more than twenty (20) signatures on one (1) sheet shall be counted. Each signature sheet shall contain signatures of qualified electors from only one (1) county.

        Former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t34c18s34-1805" target="_self">§ 34-1805 </a></cite>violated the Equal Protection Clause because the few voters in a sparsely populated county had a power equal to the vastly larger number of voters who resided in a populous county, and an electoral system could not be based on treating unequal counties equally and making the electoral determination dependent on the support of numbers of counties rather than numbers of people, but to the extent that Idaho wished to create a check on the will of the majority by a nondiscriminatory means, the Equal Protection Clause was no bar; thus, the court affirmed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of advocacy groups that challenged the statute.

On a showing that any petition filed is not legally sufficient, the court may enjoin the secretary of state and all other officers from certifying or printing on the official ballot for the ensuing election the ballot title and numbers of such measure. All such suits shall be advanced on the court docket and heard and decided by the court as quickly as possible. Either party may appeal to the Supreme Court within ten (10) days after a decision is rendered. The district court of the fourth judicial district of the state of Idaho in and for Ada County shall have jurisdiction in all cases of measures to be submitted to the qualified electors of the state at large.

         The attorney general shall issue a certificate of review to the secretary of state certifying that he has reviewed the measure for form and style and that the recommendations thereon, if any, have been communicated to the petitioner, and such certificate shall be issued whether or not the petitioner accepts such recommendations. The certificate of review shall be available for public inspection in the office of the secretary of state.

         In making the ballot title, the attorney general shall, to the best of his ability, give a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure and in such language that the ballot title shall not be intentionally an argument or likely to create prejudice either for or against the measure.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t34c18s34-1809ol13">
       Any person dissatisfied with the ballot title or the short title provided by the attorney general for any measure may appeal to the supreme court by petition, praying for a different title and setting forth the reason why the title prepared by the attorney general is insufficient or unfair.
    (a) No appeal shall be allowed from the decision of the attorney general on a ballot title unless made within twenty (20) days after the ballot title is filed in the office of the secretary of state; provided however, that this section shall not prevent any later judicial proceeding to determine the sufficiency of such title, nor shall it prevent any judicial decision upon the sufficiency of such title.

       Any qualified elector of the state of Idaho may, at any time after the attorney general has issued a certificate of review, bring an action in the supreme court to determine the constitutionality of any initiative.

     <p>
      (b) A copy of every such ballot title shall be served by the secretary of state upon the person offering or filing such initiative or referendum petition, or appeal. The service of the ballot title may be by mail or electronic transmission and shall be made forthwith when it is received from the attorney general by the secretary of state.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) The supreme court shall thereupon examine said measure, hear argument, and in its decision thereon certify to the secretary of state a ballot title and a short title for the measure in accord with the intent of this section. The secretary of state shall print on the official ballot the title thus certified to him.

        Where petition was filed for an initiated measure concerning the right to work whether or not a person was a member of a labor union, a short title furnished by attorney-general entitled “The Right to Work Initiative Proposed” was defective, since title did not refer to membership in a labor union.

        Where attorney general’s short title failed to capture the distinctive characteristics of the proposed initiative in that it inaccurately informed voters that the purpose of the initiative was to create a law prohibiting post-viability abortions, with exceptions, but, in fact, did not create a new law but rather deleted an exception to the existing ban on post-viability abortions, added a new exception to the ban, created new civil causes of action, new criminal liabilities and repealed existing criminal penalties against pregnant women who violated the chapter, the short title was not the product of an analysis of the initiative that distinguished the initiative from existing abortion laws and, as such, it required redrafting.

        In order to overcome the prima facie effect of an election return, it is incumbent on the challenger to prove not only illegal votes, but also for whom they were cast. Both these elements of proof are required to show that the illegal votes affected the result, and that, but for them, appellant would have been elected. Brannon v.
