      <li id="t56c01s56-101ol11">
       “Appraisal” means the method of determining the value of the property as determined by an appraisal conducted by a member of the appraisal institute (MAI), or successor organization. The appraisal must specifically identify the values of land, building, equipment, and goodwill.

      </li>
      <li id="t56c01s56-101ol19">

         “Freestanding skilled care” means a nursing facility, as defined in and licensed under chapter 13, title 39, Idaho Code, which is not owned, managed, or operated by, nor is otherwise a part of a hospital, as defined in section 39-1301(a), Idaho Code; and

      <li id="t56c01s56-101ol111">
       “Goodwill” means the amount paid by the purchaser that exceeds the net tangible assets received. The value of goodwill is derived from the economic benefits that a going concern may enjoy, as compared with a new one, from established relations in the related markets, with government departments and other noncommercial bodies and with personal relationships. These intangible assets cannot be separated from the business and sold as can plant and equipment. Under the theory that the excess payment would be made only if expected future earnings justified it, goodwill is often described as the price paid for excess future earnings. The amortization of goodwill is nonallowable, nonreimbursable expense.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall not apply to hospital-based facilities which are subject to the provisions of section 56-120, Idaho Code, or to intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities which are subject to the provisions of section 56-265, Idaho Code. The provisions of this section are applicable to all other facilities. The property rental rate includes compensation for major movable equipment but not for minor movable equipment. The property rental rate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest for financing the cost of land and depreciable assets. Prior to final audit, the director shall determine an interim rate that approximates the property rental rate. The property rental rate shall be determined as follows:

However, for freestanding skilled care facilities “change in building costs” = 1.145 from July 1, 1991, through December 31, 1991. Thereafter, change in building costs for freestanding skilled care facilities will be adjusted each calendar year to reflect the reported annual change in the building cost index for a class D building in the western region, as of September of the prior year as published by the Marshall Swift Valuation Service or the consumer price index for renter’s costs available in September of the prior year, whichever is greater.

However, beginning July 1, 1991, for freestanding skilled care facilities, “age of facility” will be a revised age which is the lesser of the age established under other provisions of this section or the age which most closely yields the rate allowable to existing facilities as of June 30, 1991, under subsection (1) of this section.

Adequate documentation shall include, but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building permits, tax assessors’ records, receipts, invoices, building contracts, and original notes of indebtedness. The director shall compute an appropriate age for facilities when documentation is provided to reflect expenditures for building expansion or remodeling prior to the effective date of this section. The computation shall decrease the age of a facility by an amount consistent with the expenditure and the square footage impacted and shall be calculated as follows:

           The director shall adjust the effective age of a facility when major repairs, replacement, remodeling or renovation initiated after April 1, 1985, would result in a change in age of at least one (1) year. Such changes shall not increase the allowable property rental rate by more than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the adjusted property base determined in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) of this section and the rental rate paid to the facility at the time of completion of such changes but before the change component has been added to said rate.

       A “grandfathered rate” for existing facilities will be determined by dividing the audited allowable annual property costs, exclusive of taxes and insurance, for assets on hand as of January 1, 1985, by the total patient days in the period July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1985. The property rental rate will be the greater of the amount determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, or the grandfathered rate. The director shall adjust the grandfathered rate of a facility to compensate the owner for the cost of major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling and renovation initiated prior to April 1, 1985, and completed after January 1, 1985, but completed no later than December 31, 1985. For facilities receiving a grandfathered rate making major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling or renovation, initiated after January 1, 1986, the director shall compare the grandfathered rate of the facility to the actual depreciation, amortization, and interest for the current audit period plus the per diem of the recognized cost of major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling or renovation, amortized over the American hospital association guideline component useful life. The greater of the two (2) numbers will be allowed as the grandfathered rate. Such changes shall not increase the allowable grandfathered rate by more than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the current grandfathered rate and the adjusted property base determined in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) of this section.
    (3) The property rental rate per day of care paid to facilities with leases signed prior to March 30, 1981, will be the sum of the annualized allowed lease costs and the other annualized property costs for assets on hand as of January 1, 1985, exclusive of taxes and insurance when paid separately, divided by total patient days in the period June 30, 1983, through July 1, 1984. Effective July 1, 1989, the director shall adjust the property rental rate of a leased skilled facility under this paragraph to compensate for the cost of major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling and renovation initiated after January 1, 1985, by adding the per diem of the recognized cost of such expenditures amortized over the American hospital association guideline component useful life. Such addition shall not increase the allowable property rental rate by more than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the current property rental rate and the adjusted property base as determined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of this section. Where such leases contain provisions that bind the lessee to accept an increased rate, reimbursement shall be at a rate per day of care which reflects the increase in the lease rate. Where such leases bind the lessee to the lease and allow the rate to be renegotiated, reimbursement shall be at a rate per day of care which reflects an annual increase in the lease rate not to exceed the increase in the consumer price index for renters costs. After the effective date of this subsection, if such a lease is terminated or if the lease allows the lessee the option to terminate other than by purchase of the facility, the property rental rate shall become the amount determined by the formula in subsection (1) of this section as of the date on which the lease is or could be terminated.

      (b) In the event of a forced sale of a facility where the seller has been receiving a grandfathered rate, the buyer will receive a rate based upon his incurred property costs, exclusive of taxes and insurance, for the twelve (12) months following the sale, divided by the facility’s total patient days for that period, or the property rental rate, whichever is higher, but not exceeding the rate that would be due the seller.

        This section is broad enough to allow an applicant for support enforcement services to request the state to pursue the applicant’s reimbursement claim in a paternity and child support action; moreover, the state’s interest in pursuing the action is derivative, and because the applicant derives a direct interest in the outcome of the litigation, the applicant is in privity with the state. Therefore, the applicant must raise any claims for reimbursement in the paternity action, otherwise any later attempt to raise the claims will be barred by res judicata. Lohman v. Flynn, 139 Idaho 312, 78 P.3d 379 (2003). Cited State Dep’t of Health & Welfare ex rel. Gage v. Engelbert, 114 Idaho 89, 753 P.2d 825 (1988).

      § 56-203B. Payment of public assistance for child constitutes debt to department by parents — Limitations — Department subrogated to rights.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any payment of public assistance money made to or for the benefit of any dependent child or children creates a debt due or owing to the department by the parent or others who are responsible for support of such children in an amount equal to the support obligation as is subsequently determined by court order pursuant to the Idaho child support guidelines which debt arises at the end of the first month for which the payment of public assistance commences. If a judgment entered by the court under the Idaho child support guidelines is more than the public assistance expended, the amount in excess of the public assistance expended shall be payable to the custodial parent or caretaker. Provided, that where there has been a district court order, the debt shall be limited to the amount provided for by said order. The department shall have the right to petition the appropriate district court for modification of a district court order on the same grounds as a party to said cause. Where a child has been placed in foster care, and a written agreement for payment of support has been entered into by the responsible parent or parents and the department, the debt shall be limited to the amount provided for in said agreement. Provided, that if a court order for support is or has been entered, the provisions of said order shall prevail over the agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department shall be subrogated to the right of said child or children or person having the care, custody and control of said child or children to prosecute or maintain any support action existing under the laws of the state of Idaho to obtain reimbursement of moneys thus expended. If a district court order enters judgment for an amount of support to be paid by an obligor parent, the department shall be subrogated to the debt created by such order, and said money judgment shall be deemed to be in favor of the department. This subrogation shall specifically be applicable to temporary spouse support orders, family maintenance orders and alimony orders up to the amount paid by the department in public assistance moneys to or for the benefit of a dependent child or children but allocated to the benefit of said children on the basis of providing necessities for the caretaker of said children.
     </p>
     <p>
      Debt under this section shall not be incurred by, nor at any time be collected from a parent or other person who would be or is eligible for or who is the recipient of public assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children for the period such person or persons are in such status and the collection of the debt from such person would not be in the fiscal interest of the state or would not be in the best interest of the child(ren) for whom such person owes support.

        The department of health and welfare was not barred by res judicata from seeking reimbursement from former wife for aid to families with dependent children paid to former husband prior to the couple’s divorce, even though the department did not assert its claim in the divorce proceedings.

       </p>
       <p>
        The statutes providing for parental reimbursement of assistance to a child do not contain the term “wilfully.” That word comes from a criminal statute,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c04s18-401" target="_blank">§ 18-401</a></cite>, which authorizes imposition of criminal penalties in certain cases of nonsupport. It may be that the state is put to more rigorous elements of proof if it seeks criminal penalties, but no such penalties are at issue here. “Wilfulness” is not a required element of proof in a civil reimbursement case.

Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend.

The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act, develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions.

        The language of regulations used by the department of health and welfare to determine allowable costs to be deducted from gross income, in establishing eligibility for assistance, does not limit the allowable deductions to those items listed; the terms “include” and “such as” are not restrictive terms which exclude other appropriate costs from also being deductible.

       There is hereby created in the dedicated fund the medical assistance account. The medical assistance account shall be an entity primarily designed to receive moneys from the families and relatives of patients receiving medical assistance under the state plan for medicaid, and to provide a source of moneys to pay for the state’s share of medical assistance expenses. Moneys in the medical assistance account may not be commingled with moneys in the cooperative welfare account [fund].

If a recipient fails to notify the department of such claim, the department may recover the amount of any public assistance obtained by the recipient while the recipient pursued such claim. In addition, if the recipient recovers funds, either by settlement or judgment, from such a third party or entity, the recipient shall reimburse the department to the extent of the funds received in settlement minus attorney’s fees and costs, the amount of the medical assistance benefits paid by the department on his behalf as a result of the occurrence giving rise to the need for medical assistance.

The department will be entitled to reimbursement of medical assistance benefits paid on behalf of the recipient arising from the incident or occurrence prior to any amount being distributed to the recipient. The department may notify such third party or entity of the department’s entitlement to receive the reimbursement prior to any amount being distributed to the recipient. Furthermore, the department may instruct the third party or entity to make such payment directly to the department prior to any amount being distributed to the recipient. Any third party or entity who distributed funds in violation of such a notice shall be liable to the department for the amount of the reimbursement.

If a settlement or judgment is received by the recipient without delineating what portion of the settlement or judgment is in payment of medical expenses, it will be presumed that the settlement or judgment applies first to the medical expenses incurred by the recipient in an amount equal to the expenditure for medical assistance benefits paid by the department as a result of the occurrence giving rise to the payment or payments to the recipient.

        Subsection (4) is unambiguous and describes the precise circumstances that occurred in this case. Following the jury’s award, but before final judgment was entered, the plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement with the manufacturer of the component part which caused the accident. The settlement agreement did not specify what portion of the settlement was in payment of the medical expenses, and, as this circumstance falls directly within the dictates of subsection (4), the statute specifically and unambiguously requires that the settlement be applied first to Medicaid payments in an amount equal to the expenditures for medical assistance benefits paid by the department. Therefore the plaintiff was required to fully reimburse the department of health and welfare for the medical benefits paid for his benefit minus the department’s pro rata share of attorney fees and costs.

       Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement levels are a combination of the cost of the drug and a dispensing fee which includes such pharmaceutical care services as counseling, obtaining a patient history, documentation and dispensing. Pharmacy reimbursement levels may be adjusted in accordance with rules promulgated by the director through negotiated rulemaking with interested parties including representatives of the pharmacy profession.

       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t56c02s56-209gol12a">
         The EAC is defined by the department as the average acquisition cost (AAC) of the drug, or when no AAC is available, reimbursement will be wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). WAC shall mean the price, paid by a wholesaler for the drugs purchased from the wholesaler’s supplier, typically the manufacturer of the drug as published by a recognized compendia of drug pricing on the last day of the calendar quarter that corresponds to the calendar quarter.
        </li>
        <li id="t56c02s56-209gol12b">
         The department shall establish pharmacy dispensing fee payments based on the results of surveys of pharmacies and dispensing rates paid to other payers. The dispensing fee structure will be tiered, with the tiers based on the annual medicaid claims volume of the enrolled Idaho retail pharmacy. All other pharmacy dispensing fees will be the lowest dispensing fee for the tiered structure.

      </li>
      <li id="t56c02s56-209gol13">

Participating pharmacies that refuse to respond to the periodic state surveys will be disenrolled as a medicaid provider.

The department shall promulgate rules clarifying the methodology used when computing and assessing a civil monetary penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) For conduct identified in subsection (6)(a) through (i) of this section, the amount of the penalties shall be up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each item or service improperly claimed, except that in the case of multiple penalties the department may reduce the penalties to not less than ten percent (10%) of the amount of each item or service improperly claimed if an amount can be readily determined. Each line item of a claim, or cost on a cost report is considered a separate claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) For failing to perform required background checks or failing to meet required timelines for completion of background checks, the amount of the penalty shall be five hundred dollars ($500) for each month worked for each staff person for whom the background check was not performed or not timely performed up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per month. A partial month is considered a full month for purposes of determining the amount of the penalty.

      (9) Exclusion. Any individual or entity convicted of a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under any state or federal program shall be excluded from program participation as a medicaid provider for a period of not less than ten (10) years. Unless otherwise provided in this section or required by federal law, the department may exclude any individual or entity for a period of not less than one (1) year for any conduct for which the secretary of the department of health and human services or designee could exclude an individual or entity.
     </p>
     <p>
      (10) Sanction of individuals or entities. The department may sanction individuals or entities by barring them from public assistance programs for intentional program violations where the federal law allows sanctioning individuals from receiving assistance. Individuals or entities who are determined to have committed an intentional program violation will be sanctioned from receiving public assistance for a period of twelve (12) months for the first violation, twenty-four (24) months for the second violation and permanently for the third violation.

      § 56-209i. Legislative findings.
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this act enhance the employability of participants in the temporary assistance for families in Idaho (TAFI) programs through substance abuse screening and, where appropriate, testing and treatment. The legislature finds that a significant number of employers use preemployment drug testing. Substance abuse adds to the difficulties such individuals have in securing employment. The legislature also finds that substance abuse in and of itself impairs personal responsibility and self-sufficiency and stands in the way of the very intent of the TAFI program to care for the health and welfare of certain qualified recipients and in so doing results in welfare costs that burden the state’s taxpayers. The legislature further finds that substance abuse adversely affects a significant portion of the workforce, which results in billions of dollars of lost productivity each year and poses a threat to the safety of the workplace and to the public safety and security. In balancing the interests of taxpayers, participants in the TAFI program and potential employers against the interests of those who will be screened and tested under this act, the legislature finds that screening, testing and treatment as provided for in this act are in the greater interests of all concerned.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t56c02s56-209nol11">
       The legislature finds that many individuals with disabilities would like to work but cannot afford to enter the workforce due to the fear of losing necessary medical services received through medicaid. Idaho hereby seeks to avail itself of the opportunity available through the federal ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999, which allows states to establish new medicaid eligibility categories for working people with disabilities whose income or resources would otherwise make them ineligible for medicaid. Eliminating barriers to health care and other needed services and supports and creating financial incentives to work will greatly improve the short and long-term financial independence and well-being of people with disabilities. Medicaid for workers with disabilities will serve to increase the productivity of Idaho residents with disabilities and thereby enhance the economic and fiscal status of this state.

        Where state department regulations provided that public assistance recipients could retain up to $500 in cash, and that any retroactive payment made to correct an underpayment would be excluded from the determination of a recipient’s income and resources in the month paid and in the next following month, such regulations were consistent with the purposes of the aid to families with dependent children program as established by federal law and as implemented in Idaho by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t56c02s56-209" target="_self">§ 56-209</a></cite>. Where the department followed its regulations and excluded a March lump-sum retroactive payment of $5800 from the recipients’ resources during March and April, the department acted properly when in May it considered the $2900 that remained from that March payment as a resource of the recipients and terminated their benefits since that amount far exceeded the $500 limitation of the state regulation.

        Where the mother was living in a house owned by her parents and was not herself eligible for a housing allowance, this did not negate the eligibility of her children, and, therefore, her family, for aid to dependent children benefits, even though this allowance was paid to the mother as the caretaker parent.

       <p>
        The language of regulations used by the department of health and welfare to determine allowable costs to be deducted from gross income, in establishing eligibility for assistance, does not limit the allowable deductions to those items listed; the terms “include” and “such as” are not restrictive terms which exclude other appropriate costs from also being deductible.

However, if there is no administration of the estate of the first deceased spouse, or if no actual notice is given to the director as required by subsection (5) of this section, no claim shall be required until the time provided for creditor claims in the estate of the survivor.

        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 179, rewrote subsection (1), which formerly read: “Except where exempted or waived in accordance with federal law medical assistance pursuant to this chapter paid on behalf of an individual who was fifty-five (55) years of age or older when the individual received such assistance may be recovered from the individual’s estate, and the estate of the spouse, if any, for such aid paid to either or both; provided, however, that claim for such medical assistance correctly paid to the individual may be established against the estate of either spouse, but there shall be no adjustment or recovery thereof until after the death of the spouse, if any, and only at a time when the individual has no surviving child who is under twenty-one (21) years of age or is blind or permanently and totally disabled as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1382c. Transfers of real or personal property, on or after the look-back dates defined in 42 U.S.C. 1396p, by recipients of such aid, or their spouses, without adequate consideration are voidable and may be set aside by an action in the district court” and made that subsection into present subsections (1) and (2); redesignated former subsection (2) as present subsection (3); deleted former subsection (3), which formerly read: “Nothing in this section authorizes the recovery of the amount of any aid from the estate or surviving spouse of a recipient to the extent that the need for aid resulted from a crime committed against the recipient”; added the subsection (a) designation at the beginning of the second sentence of subsection (6); substituted “decedent” for “individual for whom medical assistance was paid under this chapter” in present subsection (6)(a); added subsections (6)(b) to (6)(c); substituted “estate subject to recovery is income-producing property that” for “only asset of the estate” in subsection (7)(a); and in subsection (7)(c), deleted “under the lien” following “Recovery”, substituted “cause” for “entitle”, and inserted “be eligible for.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 182, in subsection (5), deleted the former last sentence, subsections (5)(a) and (5)(b), and the last paragraph, which all dealt with petitioning the court for an exempt property allowance claim under certain circumstances.

        Section 10 of S.L. 1997, ch. 205 read: “Notwithstanding the effective dates specified in section 1 through 9 of this act, nothing in this act shall take effect unless the secretary of state shall certify to the Idaho Code Commission that he has received a sufficient appropriation to provide for the development of the technology required to implement the provisions of this act. If the certification is not made by the twenty-first day after the adjournment sine die of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-fourth Idaho Legislature, this act shall be null and void.”

        Even though federal law preempted this section, where a marriage settlement agreement transmuted most of husband’s and wife’s community property and the income from that property into separate property of the husband, the department of health and welfare could recover only community property accumulated after the agreement. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Jackman, 132 Idaho 213, 970 P.2d 6 (1998), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011). Recovery from Spouse’s Estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the estate of an individual who received Medicaid assistance is inadequate to repay the full amount of the assistance received, the state can recover the balance from the estate of the surviving spouse. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. Jackman, 132 Idaho 213, 970 P.2d 6 (1998), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an attempt to recoup Medicaid benefits paid out on behalf of decedent’s husband, the Idaho department of health and welfare maintained that it was entitled to proceed against decedent’s estate; magistrate properly ruled that the department had no cause of action under this section because the decedent was entitled to retain certain assets for her own use. State, Dept. of Health & Welfare v. Estate of Elliott (In re Estate of Elliott), 141 Idaho 177, 108 P.3d 324 (2005), overruled on other grounds, City of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 277 P.3d 353 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho department of health and welfare could not recover medicaid benefits paid to a decedent until his spouse died, but its claim for reimbursement was still subject to the deadlines of<cite class="id_code">§ 15-3</cite>-803(a)(1); as the department did not present its claim within two years after the decedent’s death, the claim was untimely. State v. Estate of Kaminsky (In re Estate of Kaminsky), 141 Idaho 436, 111 P.3d 121 (2005), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action in which the Idaho department of health & welfare sought to recover Medicaid benefits paid to a decedent’s spouse, state law was not preempted by 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396p, because, based on the ambiguously inclusive nature of an “estate” as defined in 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396p(b)(4)(B) and the definition of “assets” in 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396p(h)(1), the department could recover assets from both spouses’ estates under subsection (1) of this section, including a home which was previously the community property of the spouse, although it was not her property at the time of her death. Idaho Dep’t of Health v. McCormick (In re Estate of George), 153 Idaho 468, 283 P.3d 785 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section and federal law permit the department of health and welfare to recover medical payments, paid on behalf of now deceased wife, from deceased husband’s estate, based on assets that had once been wife’s community property, but had been transmuted into husband’s separate property, for the purpose of making wife eligible for Medicaid State v. Wiggins (In re Estate of Wiggins), 155 Idaho 116, 306 P.3d 201 (2013).

        Trial court did not err in refusing to treat 35 separate counts of welfare fraud as a single crime where defendant was required to complete a new aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) application form for each welfare check, since the appropriation of different sums of money on separate occasions by fresh affirmative acts constitutes the commission of separate offenses.

     <p>
      It is hereby declared by the legislature that, in keeping with current state and national goals and best practice, increasing numbers of persons with developmental disabilities are being discharged to community facilities or private residences as an alternative to large public institutions licensed as intermediate care facilities for persons with intellectual disabilities. Such deinstitutionalization is highly desirable since it can lead to a fuller, richer and more independent life for persons with developmental disabilities. Recognizing that every individual has unique needs and differing abilities, the purpose of the following provisions is to clarify the department of health and welfare’s duties and responsibilities with respect to persons with developmental disabilities, who are or may become residents of the southwest Idaho treatment center, a public institution licensed for nine (9) or more beds as an intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities. The following provisions shall be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes.

       The legislature finds that the current federal medicaid law and regulations have not kept pace with modern health care management practices, create obstacles to quality care and impose unnecessary costs on the delivery of effective and efficient health care. The legislature believes that the state of Idaho must strive to balance efforts to contain medicaid costs, improve program quality and improve access to services. The legislature further believes that the state of Idaho could achieve improved health outcomes for medicaid participants by simplifying eligibility and developing health benefits for medicaid participants according to their health needs, including appropriate preventive and wellness services.

       A service dog shall be under the control of its handler.

       Inquiries. A place of public accommodation shall not ask about the nature or extent of a person’s disability but may make two (2) inquiries to determine whether an animal qualifies as a service dog. A place of public accommodation may ask: if the service dog is required because of a disability; and what work or task the service dog has been trained to perform. A place of public accommodation shall not require documentation, such as proof that the service dog has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service dog. A place of public accommodation may not make inquiries about a service dog when it is readily apparent that the service dog is trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability, such as: the dog is observed guiding an individual who is blind or has low vision, pulling an individual’s wheelchair, or providing assistance with stability or balance to an individual with an observable mobility disability.

       Access.

If a place of public accommodation normally charges individuals for the damage they cause, an individual with a disability may be charged for damage caused by the individual’s service dog.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t56c07s56-708ol11">
       Findings and intent. The federal achieving a better life experience (ABLE) act, public law 113-295, 26 U.S.C. 529A, provides that a state may establish a program under which certain individuals with disabilities may open accounts in order to save money to pay for qualified disability expenses, such as expenses relating to education, housing, transportation, employment training and assistive technology. These accounts may be opened by qualified Idahoans in any state having an ABLE account program, and are to be disregarded when determining an individual’s eligibility for assistance programs established by federal law, including medicaid and supplemental security income. Though Idaho has not implemented its own ABLE account program, the legislature finds that ABLE accounts promote dignified personal independence and opportunities for individuals with disabilities. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to ensure that the state provide technical assistance to Idahoans interested in opening ABLE accounts in other states, and to protect the eligibility of individuals who have such ABLE accounts when applying for state or local assistance.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c07s56-708ol12">
       Eligibility. Notwithstanding any provision of state law or local ordinance to the contrary, if an applicant for a state or local assistance program or a need-based state or local grant has an ABLE account in another state, the account, and any activity related thereto, shall be disregarded when determining the applicant’s eligibility for the assistance program or grant to the extent that the account and any activity related thereto would be disregarded in determining the applicant’s eligibility for an assistance program established by federal law.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c07s56-708ol13">
       Technical assistance. Subject to appropriation, there is hereby established a function to provide individuals with disabilities, and those assisting them, technical assistance relating to the ABLE act. Such function shall be within the Idaho state independent living council until such time as it might be assigned to another appropriate agency. Such technical assistance shall include information and assistance with respect to setting up ABLE accounts in other states, whether through or in conjunction with databases and websites operated by or under the auspices of organizations or government agencies, or otherwise, and the provision of information related to financial literacy.

It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Idaho ensure the welfare of its residents by conducting its child and family support enforcement responsibilities with all due care. Cooperation with other jurisdictions, be they sister states or foreign countries, is vital to ensure that the children and others of this state receive the support to which they are entitled and on which they depend. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act, develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”
    Section 69 of S.L. 2015 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provided: “Report — Legislative Intent. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall monitor proceedings affecting Idaho residents that are conducted pursuant to the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance and make a report of such proceedings to the Legislature upon request. If at any time it appears that such proceedings are imperiling Idaho residents or affecting Idaho residents in an unjust manner, it is the intent of the Legislature that request be made to the federal government to file a denunciation under Article 64 of the Convention on behalf of the State of Idaho.”

        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 281, in the section heading, deleted “pilot project” from the end; in subsection (1), deleted “and for the purpose of participating in a pilot project” following “protection of children and vulnerable adults,” and substituted the language beginning “checks of individuals who provide care” for “checks of providers, employees and contractors who have access to patients in long-term care settings,” and deleted the last two sentences, which read: “Long-term care facilities or providers include nursing facilities, institutional care facilities for the mentally retarded, residential or assisted living facilities, long-term care hospitals or hospitals with swing beds, and home health and hospice providers. The criminal history and background checks for long-term care providers, employees and contractors will be funded through the federal grant at no cost to the long-term care providers, employees, or contractors.”; added subsection (2)(h); rewrote subsection (3), which formerly read: “Each individual who has patient access is required to complete the criminal history and background check process. The department of health and welfare shall promulgate rules to further define those individuals and the effective date. Each applicant must sign forms provided by the department authorizing the department to obtain and release information in accordance with state and federal law. The applicant must disclose all information requested, including information on past convictions, driver’s license revocations, and known adult or child protection findings. Once this disclosure is made, the department shall make a preliminary determination as to whether the individual may have access to individuals in a long-term care setting on a provisional basis pending the final determination. Long-term care facilities or providers may not allow an individual to provide care or have patient access until the applicant is given a provisional status.”; in subsection (4), substituted “promulgated rules” for “existing rules” in the second sentence, and deleted “existing” preceding “department rules” in the third sentence; rewrote subsection (5), which formerly read: “Applicants who knowingly fail to disclose information on the forms provided or who falsify information may be subject to criminal penalties under chapter 32, title 18, Idaho Code.”; and added subsections (7) and (9), and redesignated former subsection (7) as (8).

A victim of cystic fibrosis is capable of continuing to work and lead a productive life if proper medical care is provided.

      § 56-1024. Idaho time sensitive emergency system of care — Statement of intent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Time sensitive emergencies, specifically blunt trauma injuries, strokes and heart attacks, were three (3) of the top five (5) causes of deaths in Idaho in 2011. Numerous studies throughout the United States have demonstrated that organized systems of care improve patient outcomes, thus reducing the frequency of preventable death and improving the functional status of the patient. The institute of medicine’s report “Hospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point” recommended improving the care of critical illness through regionalization by transporting critically ill patients to designated specialized care centers when appropriate. Early treatment and transfer when necessary will save the lives of Idahoans stricken with these emergency conditions. Trauma systems of care are well understood as they have existed in many other states for decades. It is the intent of this legislation to create an integrated and responsive system of care for Idaho citizens. The trauma component will serve as the initial framework in a deliberate, incremental implementation approach for a comprehensive system of care for time sensitive emergencies in Idaho. The time sensitive emergency system in Idaho is intended to be voluntary and inclusive. The system will be designed such that all facilities, and in particular critical access hospitals, have the opportunity to participate. No facility shall be excluded from receiving medically appropriate patients based solely on the facility’s decision of not seeking designation.

       The legislature finds that accidental poisoning is a serious public health problem in the state of Idaho and is a problem that disproportionately affects Idaho’s children. It further finds that a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality resulting from such accidental poisonings has occurred as a result of the services provided by the poison control center.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c10s56-1036ol12">
       The purpose of sections 56-1036 through 56-1040, Idaho Code, is to declare legislative support for the important work of the poison control center and to assure, by statute, the continued existence of the poison control center.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c10s56-1036ol13">
       The legislature finds that the poison control center has saved lives and reduced suffering associated with poisoning by providing emergency telephone assistance and treatment referral to victims of such incidents, by providing immediate treatment information to health care professionals, and by providing public education and prevention programs.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c10s56-1036ol14">
       The legislature recognizes that enhanced cooperation between the emergency medical system and poison control centers will aid in responding to emergencies resulting from exposure to poisons and that, by providing telephone assistance to individuals with possible exposure to poisons, the need for emergency room and professional office visits will be reduced. As a result, the cost of health care to those who may have been poisoned will be avoided or reduced and appropriate treatment will be assured.

       The problem of poverty will not be solved solely by government programs and income subsidies.

      <li id="t56c11s56-1102ol12">
       It is in the best interest of all Idahoans to structure incentives in a way that will result in a greater likelihood that low-income and working-poor individuals will attain self-sufficiency.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c11s56-1102ol13">
       It is in the best interest of all Idahoans to encourage low-income individuals, neighborhoods and communities to benefit from the developments achieved through the growth in assets and investments.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c11s56-1102ol14">
       Achieving self-sufficiency and assessing economic opportunity for low-income and working-poor individuals can be addressed through public policy that invests in asset accumulation and is supported by private sector philanthropy.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c11s56-1102ol15">
       Providing a structured savings situation for low-income and working-poor individuals enhances their chances of fulfilling major life goals and opportunities and incorporates them into the economic mainstream.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c11s56-1102ol16">
       The state has an opportunity to take advantage of private and public resources by making the transition to an asset-based antipoverty strategy. Those resources include, but are not limited to, the assets for independence act (42 U.S.C. section 604) and the workforce investment act (P.L. 105-220).
      </li>
      <li id="t56c11s56-1102ol17">
       Investment through an individual development account program will help lower-income households obtain the assets they need to succeed. Communities and this state will experience resultant economic and social benefits accruing from the promotion of job training and higher education, home ownership and small business development.
      </li>
      <li id="t56c11s56-1102ol18">
       It is desirable for this state to enact legislation that enables an authorized fiduciary organization sufficient flexibility to receive private, state and federal moneys for individual development accounts. The legislature should periodically review the provisions of this chapter to ensure that this state maximizes the receipt of available federal moneys for individual development accounts.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Idaho state independent living council, as hereby created and as provided for in this chapter, is not a single department of state government unto itself, nor is it a part of any of the twenty (20) departments of state government authorized by section 20, article IV, of the constitution of the state of Idaho, or of the departments prescribed in section 67-2402, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is legislative intent that the Idaho state independent living council operate and be recognized not as a state agency or department, but as a governmental entity whose creation has been authorized by the state, much in the same manner as other single purpose districts. Pursuant to this intent, and because the Idaho state independent living council is not a state department or agency, the Idaho state independent living council is exempt from the required participation in the services of the purchasing agent or employee liability coverage, as rendered by the department of administration. However, nothing shall prohibit the Idaho state independent living council from entering into contractual arrangements with the department of administration, or any other department of state government or an elected constitutional officer, for these or any other services.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is legislative intent to require compliance with the state merit system, and to affirm the participation of the Idaho state independent living council in the public employee retirement system, chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code, and the personnel system, chapter 53, title 67, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also legislative intent that the matters of location of deposit of Idaho state independent living council funds, or the instruments or documents of payment from those funds shall be construed as no more than items of convenience for the conduct of business, and in no way reflect upon the nature or status of the Idaho state independent living council as an entity of government.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section merely affirms that the Idaho state independent living council created under this chapter is not a state agency and in no way changes the character of it as it existed prior to this chapter. The functions previously performed by the state independent living council created by executive order no. 2002-05, are hereby transferred to the Idaho state independent living council pursuant to this chapter.
