        Rationally there is no difference in the duty of care as between those who have been involuntarily committed and those who have been voluntarily committed, and the statutes do not differentiate between the care that is required to be given to involuntarily committed children than those voluntarily committed.

      The director of an inpatient facility shall release any person, admitted in accordance with the procedure outlined in section 66-318, Idaho Code, whose continued care or treatment is no longer appropriate. If upon evaluation at the facility, it is determined that the patient is mentally ill and is likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled, the director of the facility shall institute appropriate judicial proceedings for continued care and treatment. In the case of persons confined pursuant to section 20-520 or 18-211, Idaho Code, upon completion of the examination, the sheriff of the county from which the defendant was committed shall be notified and the defendant shall continue to be confined at the facility for transportation back to the county.

      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1a">
       Proceedings for the appointment of a guardian of a mentally ill person may be commenced by the filing of a written petition with a court of competent jurisdiction by a friend, relative, spouse or guardian of the proposed patient, by a licensed physician, licensed clinical psychologist, prosecuting attorney, or other public official of a municipality, county or of the state of Idaho, or by the director of any facility in which such patient may be.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1b">
       The petition shall state the name and last known address of the proposed patient; the name and address of either the spouse, next of kin or friend of the proposed patient; whether a guardian of the proposed patient has been previously appointed under the laws of this or any other state and, if so, the name and address of the guardian and the circumstances of such appointment; and a precise statement showing that the proposed patient is mentally ill, that treatment is available for such illness, and that the proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1c">
       Any such petition shall be accompanied by a certificate of a licensed physician or licensed clinical psychologist stating that the physician or psychologist has personally examined the proposed patient within the last fourteen (14) days and is of the opinion: (i) that the proposed patient is mentally ill, (ii) that in the absence of treatment the immediate prognosis is for major distress of the proposed patient which will result in serious mental or physical deterioration of the proposed patient, (iii) that treatment is available which is likely to avoid serious mental or physical deterioration of the proposed patient, and (iv) that the proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment; or by a written statement by the physician or psychologist that the proposed patient has refused to submit to an examination.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1d">
       Upon receipt of a petition, the court shall within forty-eight (48) hours appoint another licensed physician or licensed clinical psychologist to make a personal examination of the proposed patient, or if the proposed patient has not been examined, the court shall appoint two (2) licensed physicians or licensed clinical psychologists to make individual personal examinations of the proposed patient and may order the proposed patient to submit to an immediate examination. Within seventy-two (72) hours, the physician or psychologist shall file with the court certificates described in subparagraph [subsection] (c) above, if necessary.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1e">
       Upon receipt of such petition and certificates, the court shall appoint a time and place for hearing not more than seven (7) days from receipt of such certificates and thereupon give written notice to the proposed patient. The notice shall include a copy of the petition and certificates and notice of the proposed patient’s right to be represented by an attorney, or if indigent, to be represented by a court-appointed attorney. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall also be given to the petitioner.

       An opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be afforded to every proposed patient, and if neither the proposed patient nor others provide counsel, the court shall appoint counsel in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code.

      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1g">
       The hearing shall be held at a facility, at the home of the proposed patient, or at any other suitable place not likely to have a harmful effect on the proposed patient’s physical or mental health.

       The proposed patient and the petitioner shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to present and cross-examine witnesses. At the hearing, any existing provision of law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between the examining physician or psychologist and the proposed patient shall not apply and the physicians or psychologists who examined the proposed patient shall be competent witnesses to testify as to the proposed patient’s condition. The proposed patient shall be required to be present at the hearing, and be free from drugs likely to impair the proposed patient’s ability to communicate with counsel or understand the proceedings, unless the right to be present or free from drugs is knowingly and voluntarily waived by the patient or unless the presence of the patient at the hearing would unduly disrupt the judicial proceedings. A record of the proceedings shall be made as for other civil hearings. The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with orderly procedure and the rules of evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1i">
       The court shall appoint a person other than the treating professional to act in the proposed patient’s best interest with authority to consent to treatment, if, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the record, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1i1">
         The proposed patient has a severe and reliably diagnosable mental illness;

      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1j">
       The appointed person shall have authority to consent to treatment, including treatment at a facility. Upon approval of the court, the appointed person may pay the costs of treatment from the patient’s money and tangible property deliverable to or received by the patient during the period of the appointed person’s authority, and may apply for any benefits to which the patient is entitled. In the exercise of his powers, the appointed person is to act as a fiduciary and shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees as described by section 15-7-302, Idaho Code. The appointment shall continue for a period of seven (7) weeks or until the court determines that the patient no longer lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, whichever is shorter.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-322ol1k">
       Upon petition of the appointed person, authority to consent may be continued for an additional seven (7) week period, if the court again enters the findings required by subparagraph [subsection] (i) above. The petition for continued authority shall be accompanied by the certificate of the treating professional meeting the requirements of subparagraph [subsection] (c) above. The petition for continued authority and physician’s certificate shall be served upon the patient and the patient’s attorney. If the proposed patient objects to the continued authority, the court shall conduct a hearing, following notice of the time and place of such hearing to the petitioner, the proposed patient and the proposed patient’s attorney.

       Proceedings for appointment of a person with authority to consent under this section may be consolidated with proceedings for the involuntary care of the proposed patient under section 66-329, Idaho Code, provided, however, that appointment of a person with authority to consent under this section shall terminate the proceedings for the involuntary care under section 66-329, Idaho Code.
    (m) No more than two (2) petitions with authority to consent shall be granted under subsection (i) of this section within any twelve (12) month period, provided that other proceedings under this chapter or the Uniform Probate Code shall be permitted.

      The court shall consider appointing persons to give consent in the following priority: the proposed patient’s spouse, next of kin, friend or if the proposed patient’s spouse, next of kin or friend are unable or unwilling, another appropriate person not associated with the facility where the person is being, or shall be treated.
     </p>

       No person shall be taken into custody or detained as an alleged emergency patient for observation, diagnosis, evaluation, care or treatment of mental illness unless and until the court has ordered such apprehension and custody under the provisions outlined in section 66-329, Idaho Code; provided, however, that a person may be taken into custody by a peace officer and placed in a facility, or the person may be detained at a hospital at which the person presented or was brought to receive medical or mental health care, if the peace officer or a physician medical staff member of such hospital or a physician’s assistant or advanced practice registered nurse practicing in such hospital has reason to believe that the person is gravely disabled due to mental illness or the person’s continued liberty poses an imminent danger to that person or others, as evidenced by a threat of substantial physical harm; provided, under no circumstances shall the proposed patient be detained in a nonmedical unit used for the detention of individuals charged with or convicted of penal offenses. For purposes of this section, the term “peace officer” shall include state probation and parole officers exercising their authority to supervise probationers and parolees. Whenever a person is taken into custody or detained under this section without court order, the evidence supporting the claim of grave disability due to mental illness or imminent danger must be presented to a duly authorized court within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the individual was placed in custody or detained.

       If the court finds the individual to be gravely disabled due to mental illness or imminently dangerous under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall issue a temporary custody order requiring the person to be held in a facility, and requiring an examination of the person by a designated examiner within twenty-four (24) hours of the entry of the order of the court. Under no circumstances shall the proposed patient be detained in a nonmedical unit used for the detention of individuals charged with or convicted of penal offenses.
      </li>

       If the designated examiner finds, in his examination under this section, that the person is mentally ill, and either is likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled due to mental illness, the prosecuting attorney shall file, within twenty-four (24) hours of the examination of the person, a petition with the court requesting the patient’s detention pending commitment proceedings pursuant to the provisions of section 66-329, Idaho Code. Upon the receipt of such a petition, the court shall order his detention to await hearing which shall be within five (5) days (including Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) of the detention order. If no petition is filed within twenty-four (24) hours of the designated examiner’s examination of the person, the person shall be released from the facility.

       Any person held in custody under the provisions of this section shall have the same protection and rights which are guaranteed to a person already committed to the department director.

        Magistrate must consider indigency and fix costs during commitment proceedings, considering an individual’s financial situation and determining his ability to pay commitment costs. If such person was unable to pay the costs, then the court is required to fix responsibility for payment. Bonner County v. Kootenai Hosp. Dist. (In re Daniel W.), 145 Idaho 677, 183 P.3d 765 (2008), overruled on other grounds, Verksa v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

        The placement of the reference to chapter 35, title 31, Idaho Code, in subsection (a) supports the conclusion that chapter 35, title 31 controls the determination of whether a given county is responsible for costs, but does not control the determination of the rate at which the county is responsible for those costs.

      <li id="t66c03s66-329ol11">
       Proceedings for the involuntary care and treatment of mentally ill persons by the department of health and welfare may be commenced by the filing of a written application with a court of competent jurisdiction by a friend, relative, spouse or guardian of the proposed patient, by a licensed physician, by a physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse practicing in a hospital, by a prosecuting attorney or other public official of a municipality, county or of the state of Idaho, or by the director of any facility in which such patient may be.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-329ol12">
       The application shall state the name and last known address of the proposed patient; the name and address of the spouse, guardian, next of kin, or friend of the proposed patient; whether the proposed patient can be cared for privately in the event commitment is not ordered; whether the proposed patient is, at the time of the application, a voluntary patient; whether the proposed patient has applied for release pursuant to section 66-320, Idaho Code; and a simple and precise statement of the facts showing that the proposed patient is mentally ill and either likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled due to mental illness.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-329ol13">
       Any such application shall be accompanied by a certificate of a designated examiner stating that he has personally examined the proposed patient within the last fourteen (14) days and is of the opinion that the proposed patient is: (i) mentally ill; (ii) likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled due to mental illness; and (iii) lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment;
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-329ol14">
       Upon receipt of an application for commitment, the court shall, within forty-eight (48) hours, appoint another designated examiner to make a personal examination of the proposed patient, or if the proposed patient has not been examined, the court shall appoint two (2) designated examiners to make individual personal examinations of the proposed patient and may order the proposed patient to submit to an immediate examination. If neither designated examiner is a physician, the court shall order a physical examination of the proposed patient. At least one (1) designated examiner shall be a psychiatrist, licensed physician or licensed psychologist. The designated examiners shall report to the court their findings within the following seventy-two (72) hours as to the mental condition of the proposed patient and his need for custody, care, or treatment by a facility. The reports shall be in the form of written certificates that shall be filed with the court. The court may terminate the proceedings and dismiss the application without taking any further action in the event the reports of the designated examiners are to the effect that the proposed patient is not mentally ill or, although mentally ill, is not likely to injure himself or others or is not gravely disabled due to mental illness. If the proceedings are terminated, the proposed patient shall be released immediately.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c03s66-329ol15">
       If the designated examiner’s certificate states a belief that the proposed patient is mentally ill and either likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled due to mental illness, the judge of such court shall issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace officer, or director of a facility to take the proposed patient to a facility in the community in which the proposed patient is residing or to the nearest facility to await the hearing, and for good cause may authorize treatment during such period subject to the provisions of section 66-346(a)(4), Idaho Code. Under no circumstances shall the proposed patient be detained in a nonmedical unit used for the detention of individuals charged with or convicted of penal offenses.
    (6) Upon receipt of such application and designated examiners’ reports, the court shall appoint a time and place for a hearing not more than seven (7) days from the receipt of such designated examiners’ reports and thereupon give written notice of such time and place of such hearing, together with a copy of the application, designated examiner’s certificates, and notice of the proposed patient’s right to be represented by an attorney or, if indigent, to be represented by a court-appointed attorney, to the applicant, to the proposed patient, to the proposed patient’s spouse, guardian, next of kin, or friend. With the consent of the proposed patient and his attorney, the hearing may be held immediately. Upon motion of the petitioner, or upon motion of the proposed patient and attorney, and for good cause shown, the court may continue the hearing up to an additional five (5) days during which time, for good cause shown, the court may authorize treatment.

     </p>
     <p>
      (7) An opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be afforded to every proposed patient, and, if neither the proposed patient nor others provide counsel, the court shall appoint counsel in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code, no later than the time the application is received by the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) If the involuntary detention was commenced under this section, the hearing shall be held at a facility, at the home of the proposed patient, or at any other suitable place not likely to have a harmful effect on the proposed patient’s physical or mental health. Venue for the hearing shall be in the county of residence of the proposed patient or in the county where the proposed patient was found immediately prior to commencement of such proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) In all proceedings under this section, any existing provision of the law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between the designated examiner and proposed patient shall not apply and any designated examiner who shall have examined the proposed patient shall be a competent witness to testify as to the proposed patient’s condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      (10) The proposed patient, the applicant, and any other persons to whom notice is required to be given shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to present and cross-examine witnesses. The proposed patient shall be required to be present at the hearing unless the court determines that the mental or physical state of the proposed patient is such that his presence at the hearing would be detrimental to the proposed patient’s health or would unduly disrupt the proceedings. A record of the proceedings shall be made as for other civil hearings. The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with orderly procedure. The court shall receive all relevant and material evidence consistent with the rules of evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      (11) If, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the record, and after consideration of reasonable alternatives including, but not limited to, holding the proceedings in abeyance for a period of up to thirty (30) days, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed patient:
     </p>
     <p>
      the court shall order the proposed patient committed to the custody of the department director for observation, care, and treatment for an indeterminate period of time not to exceed one (1) year. The department director, through his dispositioner, shall determine within twenty-four (24) hours the least restrictive available facility or outpatient treatment, consistent with the needs of each patient committed under this section for observation, care, and treatment.
    (12) The commitment order constitutes a continuing authorization for the department of health and welfare, law enforcement, or director of a facility, upon request of the director of the outpatient facility, the physician, or the department director through his dispositioner, to transport a committed patient to designated outpatient treatment for the purpose of making reasonable efforts to obtain the committed patient’s compliance with the terms and conditions of outpatient treatment. If the director of the outpatient facility, the treating physician, or the department director through his dispositioner determines any of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) The patient is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of outpatient treatment or the patient refuses outpatient treatment after reasonable efforts at compliance have been made; or
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Outpatient treatment is not effective after reasonable efforts have been made;
     </p>
     <p>
      the department director through his dispositioner shall cause the committed patient to be transported by the department of health and welfare, law enforcement, or director of a facility to the least restrictive available facility for observation, care, and treatment on an inpatient basis. Within forty-eight (48) hours of a committed patient’s transfer from outpatient treatment to a facility for inpatient treatment, the department director through his dispositioner shall notify the court that originally ordered the commitment, the committed patient’s attorney, and the committed patient’s spouse, guardian, adult next of kin, or friend of the change in disposition and provide a detailed affidavit reciting the facts and circumstances supporting the transfer from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment at a facility. The court shall conduct an ex parte review of the notice and affidavit within forty-eight (48) hours of filing and determine whether the change in disposition from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment at a facility is supported by probable cause. In no event shall the calculation of forty-eight (48) hours provided for in this subsection include holidays formally recognized and observed by the state of Idaho, nor shall the calculation include weekends. If the court determines that probable cause exists, the department director through his dispositioner shall continue with care and treatment on an inpatient basis at the least restrictive available facility. Within twenty-four (24) hours of a finding of probable cause, the court shall issue an order to show cause why the patient does not meet the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection. The order shall be served on the committed patient, the committed patient’s attorney and the committed patient’s spouse, guardian, adult next of kin, or friend. The patient shall have fifteen (15) days to present evidence that the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection have not been met. In no event shall the calculation of twenty-four (24) hours provided for in this subsection include holidays formally recognized and observed by the state of Idaho, nor shall the calculation include weekends. If the court determines that a change in disposition from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment does not meet the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, the department director through his dispositioner will continue with outpatient treatment on the same or modified terms and conditions. Nothing provided in this section shall limit the authority of any law enforcement officer to detain a patient pursuant to the emergency authority conferred by section 66-326, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (13) Nothing in this chapter or in any rule adopted pursuant thereto shall be construed to authorize the detention or involuntary admission to a hospital or other facility of an individual who:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Has epilepsy, a developmental disability, a physical disability, an intellectual disability, is impaired by chronic alcoholism or drug abuse, or aged, unless in addition to such condition, such person is mentally ill;
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Is a patient under treatment by spiritual means alone, through prayer, in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination by a duly accredited practitioner thereof and who asserts to any authority attempting to detain him that he is under such treatment and who gives the name of a practitioner so treating him to such authority; or
     </p>
     <p>
      (14) The order of commitment shall state whether the proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, the name and address of the patient’s attorney and the patient’s spouse, guardian, adult next of kin, or friend.
     </p>
     <p>
      (15) If the patient has no spouse or guardian and if the patient has property that may not be cared for pursuant to chapter 5, title 66, Idaho Code, or by the patient while confined at a facility, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the purpose of preserving the patient’s estate, pending further guardianship or conservatorship proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      (16) The commitment shall continue until terminated and shall be unaffected by the patient’s conditional release or change in disposition.

The fact that two separate statutes governed the recognition of those rights, i.e., former statute requiring automatic commitment of defendant acquitted on ground of mental disease or defect and this section governing involuntary civil commitments did not deny equal protection, but rather simply reflected differing factual settings under which those rights were equally recognized.

        It is the function of the trial court to initially determine whether the proposed patient is in need of treatment, and if that determination is made, then the patient is committed to the state board of health and welfare (for an indeterminate period or a six-month temporary observational period). After the commitment to the state board is made, it must then accept the patient for observation, care, treatment and evaluation; and once the court has made the determination that the patient needs treatment, its role is accomplished, and the patient becomes the responsibility of the state board.

Section 18-212 is limited in application to those defendants whose fitness to participate in the criminal proceedings has been drawn into question and is an alternative procedure, rather than the sole procedure to the exclusion of this section, for obtaining a commitment to a mental health facility for someone in the custody of a county sheriff.

The court shall thereupon appoint at least two (2) qualified psychiatrists to examine such person and to report within sixty (60) days, or such longer period as the court determines to be necessary for the purpose, their opinion as to his mental condition.

If the court is not so satisfied, it shall promptly order a hearing to determine whether such person may safely be discharged or released. Any such hearing shall be deemed a civil proceeding and the burden shall be upon the committed person to prove that he may safely be discharged or released. According to the determination of the court upon the hearing, the committed person shall thereupon be discharged or released on such conditions as the court determines to be necessary, or shall be recommitted to the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare, subject to discharge or release only in accordance with the procedure prescribed above for a first hearing.

      (5) A committed person may make application for his discharge or release to the court by which he was committed, and the procedure to be followed upon such application shall be the same as that prescribed above in the case of an application by the director of the department of health and welfare. However, no such application by a committed person need be considered until he has been confined for a period of not less than six (6) months from the date of the order of commitment and if the determination of the court be adverse to the application, such person shall not be permitted to file a further application until one (1) year has elapsed from the date of any preceding hearing on an application for his release or discharge.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) If a defendant escapes from custody during his confinement, the director shall immediately notify the court from which committed, the prosecuting attorney and the sheriff of the county from which committed. The court shall forthwith issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace officer, or the director of the institution from which the defendant escaped, to take the defendant into custody and immediately return him to his place of confinement.

       Legislative Intent.
      </h5>
      <p>
       Section 1 of S.L. 1987, ch. 59 read: “Section 67-513, Idaho Code, states: ‘The repeal of any law creating a criminal offense does not constitute a bar to the prosecution and punishment of an act already committed in violation of the law so repealed, unless the intention to bar such prosecution and punishment is expressly declared in the repealing act.’ Senate bill no. 1396, second regular session of the forty-sixth Idaho legislature, chapter 368, laws of 1982, abolished the insanity defense for a ‘person against whom a criminal complaint is filed on or after July, 1982.’ The absence in senate bill no. 1396 of a procedure for those previously found not guilty on the basis of mental disease or defect and involuntarily committed to a state mental health facility was NOT a revelation by ‘this state’s legislature . . . that it has little or no interest in delineating upon whom the initial burden of proof lies during a conditional release hearing for those involuntarily committed under I.C. section 18-214.’ Nor was the legislature ‘abdicating its authority in this regard.’ (State v. Chilton, #1620, Feb. 5, 1987, slip op. at 10) As the legislature of the state of Idaho clearly sets forth in section 14 of senate bill no. 1396: ‘This act . . . shall apply to those persons against whom a criminal complaint is filed on or after July 1, 1982.’ Thus, given the provisions of section 67-513, Idaho Code, section 1 of senate bill no. 1396 would not apply to those persons against whom a criminal complaint was filed before July 1, 1982, and with respect to those persons, the repeal of sections 18-207, 18-208, 18-209, 18-213, and 18-214, Idaho Code, would not apply. Thus for those individuals against whom a criminal complaint was filed before July 1, 1982, the provisions of sections 18-207, 18-208, 18-209, 18-213, and 18-214, Idaho Code, were, have been and are in full force and effect. The legislative intent was, and continues to be, that the procedures set forth in section 18-214, Idaho Code, for release of an individual previously acquitted on the basis of mental disease or defect are to apply to that limited class of individuals.”

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby declared by the legislature of the state of Idaho in enacting chapter 4, title 66, Idaho Code, that the citizens of Idaho who have developmental disabilities are entitled to be diagnosed, cared for, and treated in a manner consistent with their legal rights in a manner no more restrictive than for their protection and the protection of society, for a period no longer than reasonably necessary for diagnosis, care, treatment and protection, and to remain at liberty or be cared for privately except when necessary for their protection or the protection of society. Recognizing that every individual has unique needs and differing abilities, it is the purpose of the provisions of this chapter to promote the general welfare of all citizens by establishing a system which permits partially disabled and disabled persons to participate as fully as possible in all decisions which affect them, which assists such persons in meeting the essential requirements for their physical health and safety, protecting their rights, managing their financial resources, and developing or regaining their abilities to the maximum extent possible. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes.

       If it is determined that the respondent has a developmental disability and is unable to manage some financial resources or meet some essential requirements for physical health or safety, the court may appoint a partial guardian and/or partial conservator on behalf of the respondent. An order establishing partial guardianship or partial conservatorship shall define the powers and duties of the partial guardian or partial conservator so as to permit the respondent to meet essential requirements for physical health or safety and to manage financial resources commensurate with his ability to do so, and shall specify all legal restrictions to which he is subject. A respondent for whom a partial guardianship or partial conservatorship has been appointed under this chapter retains all legal and civil rights except those which have by court order been limited or which have been specifically granted to the partial guardian or partial conservator by the court.

If an appointment of a guardian is made by will pursuant to section 15-5-301, Idaho Code, such appointment shall be entitled to preference as the guardian under this chapter, if the person so appointed by will is capable of serving on behalf of the respondent and the court finds that it is not in the best interests of the respondent to appoint a different person as guardian.

       Subject to the limitations of the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, guardians or conservators may have any of the duties and powers as provided in sections 15-5-312(1)(a) through (d), 15-5-424 and 15-5-425, Idaho Code, and as specified in the order. A guardian shall be required to report to the court at least annually on the status of the respondent. A conservator shall be required to file with the court an inventory within ninety (90) days of appointment, an accounting at least annually, and a final accounting at the termination of the appointment of the conservator. All required inventories, accountings and reports shall be under oath or affirmation and shall comply with the Idaho supreme court rules.

       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8) of this section, a guardian appointed under this chapter shall have no authority to refuse or withhold consent for medically necessary treatment when the effect of withholding such treatment would seriously endanger the life or health and well-being of the respondent. To withhold or attempt to withhold consent for such treatment may be cause for removal of the guardian. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8) of this section, no health care provider or caregiver shall, based on such guardian’s direction or refusal to consent to care, withhold or withdraw such treatment for a respondent. If the health care provider cannot obtain valid consent for such medically necessary treatment from the guardian, the health care provider or caregiver shall provide the medically necessary treatment as authorized by section 39-4504(1)(i), Idaho Code.
    (8) A guardian appointed under this chapter may consent to withholding or withdrawing treatment other than appropriate nutrition or hydration to a respondent, and a health care provider may withhold or withdraw such treatment in reliance upon such consent, when in the treating LIP’s reasonable medical judgment any of the following circumstances apply:

     <p>
      If adult protective services or the protection and advocacy system determines that withholding of medical treatment violates the provisions of this section, they may petition the court for an ex parte order to provide or continue the medical treatment in question. If the court finds, based on affidavits or other evidence, that there is probable cause to believe that the withholding of medical treatment in a particular case violates the provisions of this section, and that the life or health of the patient is endangered thereby, the court shall issue an ex parte order to continue or to provide the treatment until such time as the court can hear evidence from the parties involved. Petitions for court orders under this section shall be expedited by the courts and heard as soon as possible. No bond shall be required of a petitioner under this section.

      (11) Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of a competent patient or surrogate decision-maker to withhold or withdraw treatment pursuant to section 39-4514, Idaho Code, unless the patient is a respondent as defined in section 66-402, Idaho Code.

     <p>
      Upon receipt of an application for admission to a residential facility, the head of such facility licensed under state law shall have the application reviewed or approved by an evaluation committee. The facility head may admit any developmentally disabled individual pending review by the evaluation committee for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. The evaluation committee shall determine whether the individual is in need of observation, diagnosis, care or treatment at the facility, whether there are other facilities or services less restrictive of personal liberty available and interview and examine the individual for whom admission is sought. The evaluation committee must carefully probe the individual’s background using all available sources including, but not limited to, parents, schools and other social agencies. If the head of the facility determines that the individual is not in need of observation, diagnosis, care or treatment at the facility, or determines that there are other facilities or services less restrictive of personal liberty available, the head of the facility shall, within three (3) days, discharge the individual.

       A declaration becomes operative when it is delivered to the principal’s physician or mental health treatment provider and remains valid until revoked. The physician or provider shall act in accordance with an operative declaration when the principal has been found to be incapable. The physician or provider shall continue to obtain the principal’s informed consent to all mental health treatment decisions if the principal is capable of providing informed consent or refusal.

       Upon being presented with a declaration, a physician or other provider shall make the declaration a part of the principal’s medical record if a physician-patient relationship has previously been established. If no physician-patient relationship has previously been established, nothing in this statute, or rules adopted pursuant thereto, may be read to require the establishment of physician-patient relationship in contradiction to the existing requirements of reasonable medical practice. When acting under authority of a declaration, a physician or provider shall comply with it to the fullest extent possible consistent with reasonable medical practice, the availability of treatments requested, and applicable law. If the physician or other provider is unwilling at any time to comply with the declaration, the physician or provider may withdraw from providing treatment consistent with the exercise of independent medical judgment by promptly notifying the principal and the agent and documenting the notification in the principal’s medical record.

       An agent who has accepted the appointment in writing may make decisions about mental health treatment on behalf of the principal only when the principal is incapable. The decisions must be consistent with desires the principal has expressed in the declaration.

       Except to the extent the right is limited by the declaration or any federal law, an agent has the same right as the principal to receive information regarding the proposed mental health treatment and to receive, review and consent to disclosure of medical records relating to that treatment. This right of access does not waive any evidentiary privilege.

       In exercising authority under the declaration, the agent has a duty to act consistently with the desires of the principal as expressed in the declaration.

     </p>
     <p>
      NOTICE TO PERSON MAKING A DECLARATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. This is an important legal document. It creates a declaration for mental health treatment. Before signing this document, you should know these important facts:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t66c06s66-613ol11">
       This document allows you to make decisions in advance about three (3) types of mental health treatment: psychotropic medication, electroconvulsive therapy, and short-term (up to seventeen (17) days) admission to a treatment facility. The instructions that you include in this declaration will be followed only if a court, two (2) physicians that include a psychiatrist, or a physician and a professional mental health clinician believe that you are incapable of making treatment decisions. Otherwise, you will be considered capable to give or withhold consent for the treatments.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c06s66-613ol12">
       You may also appoint a person as your agent to make these treatment decisions for you if you become incapable. The person you appoint has a duty to act consistent with your desires as stated in this document or, if your desires are not stated or otherwise made known to the agent, to act in a manner consistent with what the person in good faith believes to be in your best interest. For the appointment to be effective, the person you appoint must accept the appointment in writing. The person also has the right to withdraw from acting as your agent at any time.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c06s66-613ol13">
       This document will continue in effect until revoked. You have the right to revoke this document in whole or in part at any time you have not been determined to be incapable. YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS DECLARATION WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERED INCAPABLE BY A COURT, TWO (2) PHYSICIANS THAT INCLUDE A PSYCHIATRIST, OR A PHYSICIAN AND A PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician or other provider.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c06s66-613ol14">
       If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.

        The words “board of health and welfare” have been substituted for references to the “department of public welfare” throughout this chapter. The department of public welfare was replaced by the charitable institutions commission pursuant to S.L. 1946 (1st E.S.), ch. 26, § 9-A, as added by S.L. 1947, ch. 41, § 2, p. 46, which transferred the powers, duties and privileges conferred on the department of public welfare by title 64 of the Idaho Code Annotated (now title 66 of the Idaho Code) to the commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        S.L. 1951, ch. 257, § 1, p. 555 (§ 66-1007) transferred the powers and duties vested by this chapter in the charitable institutions commission to the department of public health.

        S.L. 1967, ch. 311, § 24, p. 870 provided that all references to the department of public health contained in the Idaho Code should be deemed to refer to the state board of health and S.L. 1972, ch. 347, § 16, p. 1017 (§ 39-114) provided that wherever the words “board of health” appeared in the Idaho Code they should mean the board of environmental protection and health.

      The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.

        If the court ultimately orders involuntary commitment of the proposed patient to the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare, the escape risk is one of the factors to be considered by the director in determining the facility in which the patient will be placed.
