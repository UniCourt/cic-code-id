     </h3>
     <p>
      County fair boards for the purpose of conducting county fairs may be created in the following manner: A petition signed by at least five (5) and not more than ten (10) persons, each of whom must be a qualified elector of the county may be filed with the clerk of the board of county commissioners of any county. Upon receipt of such petition the board of county commissioners shall immediately cause the clerk to give notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation printed within the county, for not less than two (2) weeks, to the effect that a petition for the creation of a county fair board has been filed with the clerk of the board of county commissioners and that a hearing on the petition will be held by the board of county commissioners on a date named in such notice not less than three (3) nor more than six (6) weeks from the date of the first publication of such notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a county has conducted a county fair for at least two (2) consecutive years immediately prior to the enactment of this act, it shall not be necessary to file a petition, but in such case the board of county commissioners may cause the clerk to publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation printed within the county, for at least two (2) weeks, to the effect that it is the intention of the board of county commissioners of such county to create a county fair board for the purpose of conducting a county fair in accordance with the provisions of this act, and that a hearing on the same will be held by the board of county commissioners on a date named in such notice not less than three (3) nor more than six (6) weeks from the date of the first publication of such notice.

        A county acted in its “governmental capacity” as an arm of the state in conducting a free county fair, organized and held pursuant to statutory provision, and, hence, it is not liable for injuries to one knocked down by a horse while attending the fair because of the county’s officers’ and agents’ negligence, in the absence of showing that the fair had any other revenue than that provided by taxation.

No levy for the purposes of this act shall exceed one hundredth percent (.01%) of the market value for assessment purposes on all taxable property in the county. When such taxes have been collected, the same shall be paid to the treasurer of the county fair board to be used for the purposes authorized by this act. Such special levy, together with any other special levy made pursuant to the provisions of section 31-823, Idaho Code, shall in no case exceed two hundredths percent (.02%) of the market value for assessment purposes on all taxable property in the county. Upon the creation and appointment of the fair board by the county commissioners, it hereby becomes a taxing unit under the provisions of the Idaho Budget Law and as such is empowered to issue tax anticipation notes or warrants as provided by law for maintaining, carrying on, conducting, payment of obligations, premiums, prizes and all other necessary expenses, incurred or to be incurred in conducting a fair. It may be the duty of the county commissioners of any county, where property for county fair purposes is located, to levy an amount sufficient to maintain and protect such fair grounds and property and to pay any deficit or indebtedness then accrued from previous fairs.

      § 22-307. Revenue for fair purposes.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Aside from the revenue derived from annual fairs or other exhibitions conducted, the necessary revenue shall be raised as follows: The board of directors shall meet the second week of November of each year, and shall make a budget of the amounts required in the conduct of the affairs of the district, for the current year. Included in the budget shall be an appropriation from the various counties forming the district. Each county’s assessment shall be determined by a formula, based upon population and assessed valuation. The board of directors shall certify to each board of county commissioners the amount of said budget, and the amount of revenue to be received from each county and shall file a copy thereof with the clerk of the board of county commissioners of each of the counties in said district, on or before the second week of December of each year. The respective boards of county commissioners of the counties comprising said district, shall meet in joint assembly with the directors of the fair district in January of each year, and shall at said meeting organize by electing a chairman and vice chairman and shall jointly consider the budget proposed by the board of directors of the district, and shall give such approval or make such recommendations as to them may seem proper and desirable; grant to the board of directors of the district such authority in connection with the proposed expenditures, as said commissioners, by a majority vote may decide, pass resolutions or adopt bylaws that may be necessary for the conduct of said fair, such action to be certified back to the respective counties by the board of directors of the fair district.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority vote shall be the vote of a majority of the commissioners present at said meeting, and said majority vote shall be binding upon the respective boards of commissioners of all the counties belonging to said district. If the county commissioners shall fail to hold such joint meeting, or shall fail to take any action, then the budget as prepared by the directors of the fair district shall be, without further action, deemed approved, and the sums of money apportioned to the respective counties in the district shall be the sums to be raised by special levy for said purpose. For the purpose of raising the aforesaid revenues, the board of county commissioners of each county in the district shall annually make a levy to raise the required sum apportioned to the respective counties, provided, however, that the said levy shall not exceed five thousandths percent (.005%) of the market value for assessment purposes on all of the taxable property in the county, the proceeds of which tax shall be paid into the treasury of the fair district and used for any purpose authorized by this act.

       Finding of jury that buyer of wheat to be used as seed was entitled to recover consequential damages from seller when seed proved not to be of the proper variety would not be set aside on ground that jury was not properly instructed on negligence per se; although such doctrine is ordinarily applied where plaintiff has suffered injury by defendant who is in violation of a statute, this section does not protect supplier of mislabeled seed and, hence, the statute and the doctrine of negligence per se were irrelevant.

Assessment of a civil penalty may be made in conjunction with any other department administrative action. No civil penalty may be assessed unless the person charged was given notice and opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the Idaho administrative procedure act. If the department is unable to collect such penalty or if any person fails to pay all or a set portion of the civil penalty as determined by the department, it may recover such amount by action in the appropriate district court. Any person against whom the department has assessed a civil penalty under the provisions of this section may, within thirty (30) days of the final action by the agency making the assessment, appeal the assessment to the district court of the county in which the violation is alleged by the department to have occurred. Moneys collected for violation of a rule or regulation shall be remitted to the agricultural inspection seed testing account.

      When the director or his authorized agents shall find that any person has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, he or his duly authorized agents may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the violation occurred, or the director may file with the attorney general such evidence as may be deemed necessary; provided, however, that the director may permit the defendant to appear before the director to introduce evidence either in person or by agent or attorney at a private hearing. If, after such hearing, or without such hearing in case the defendant or his agent or attorney fails or refuses to appear, the director is of the opinion that the evidence warrants prosecution, he shall proceed as herein provided.

The department may stop any commercial vehicle transporting fertilizers on the public highways and direct it to the nearest scales approved by the department to check weights of fertilizers being delivered. The department may also, upon presentation of proper identification, enter any distributor’s premises, including any vehicle of transport, at all reasonable times in order to have access to fertilizers for sampling and to examine and make copies of records relating to their distribution.

     <p>
      Any fertilizer that does not comply with this chapter is subject to seizure on complaint of the department to a court of competent jurisdiction in the geographic area in which the fertilizer is located. If the court finds the fertilizer to be in violation of this chapter and orders the condemnation of the fertilizer, the fertilizer shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the fertilizer and the laws of the state; provided, that in no instance shall the disposition of the fertilizer be ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of the fertilizer or for permission to process or relabel the fertilizer to bring it into compliance with this chapter.

Assessment of a civil penalty may be made in conjunction with any other department administrative action. No civil penalty may be assessed unless the person charged was given notice and opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. If the director is unable to collect the penalty or if any person fails to pay all or a set portion of the civil penalty as determined by the department, it may recover such amount by action in the appropriate district court.

        The law as enacted in 1915, ch. 71, p. 180, reen. C.L. 79:1-9, created the office of director of farm markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        S.L. 1919, ch. 8, § 51, p. 69 repealed C.L. 79:1 to 5, 7 to 9; § 38 of the same act (§ 67-3401 herein) abolished the office of director of farm markets; and § 26 (§ 67-2601 herein) vested his powers and duties in the department of agriculture. However, § 26 of S.L. 1919, ch. 8, was repealed by S.L. 1974, ch. 18, § 1 and § 2 of S.L. 1974, ch. 18 created the Department of Agriculture and provided for its organization (§§ 22-101 to 22-107). “Department of agriculture” has been substituted in the text for “director of farm markets” where the change is appropriate under the above legislation.

      After investigation and public hearing the department of agriculture may, from time to time, as far as practicable, establish and promulgate standards for open and closed receptacles for farm products and standards for the grade and other classification of farm products, by which their quantity, quality or value may be determined, and prescribe and promulgate rules and regulations governing the marks, brands and labels which may be required upon receptacles for farm products for the purpose of showing the name and address of the producer or packer, the quantity, nature and quality of the product, or any of them, and for the purpose of preventing deception in reference thereto; provided, that any standard for any farm product or receptacle therefor or any requirement for making receptacles for farm products now or hereafter established under authority of the congress of the United States, shall forthwith, as far as applicable and practicable, be established or prescribed and promulgated by the department as the official standard or requirement in this state.

It is further provided that all potatoes not meeting the requirements of grade hereinabove provided for and hereinafter set out are hereby declared to be detrimental to the potato industry of the state of Idaho and shall not be marketed, except as provided in this section. All potatoes conforming to the grades hereinabove and hereinafter set out shall be packed in containers or bags in conformity with the following prescribed rules. When potatoes are to be shipped out of state in bulk, permission shall first be obtained from the Idaho department of agriculture. All permits issued hereunder shall be issued subject to the requirement that the potatoes to be shipped must be graded and must either meet the Idaho grades or the United States department of agriculture grades for potatoes; except that potatoes shipped outside the state for processing into some changed form or product do not need to be graded. The Idaho department of agriculture may promulgate the necessary rules and forms to carry out this paragraph.

     <p>
      7. “Recognized types of sampling procedures” mean:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Official sampling: The sampler is a trained and licensed employee of the federal/state inspection service. The federal/state inspection service or the Idaho department of agriculture assumes full responsibility for employees in this position, ensuring that proper sampling methods and procedures, sample identity and security are maintained.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Supervised sampling: The sampler is not an employee of the federal/state inspection service nor the Idaho department of agriculture. Sampling methods and procedures, sample identity and security are randomly checked and supervised by the federal/state inspection service. Before a sampler can be employed as a supervised sampler, the sampler shall be trained and approved by the federal/state inspection service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Federal/state inspection service registers shall contain the names of trained and approved samplers used for this type of sampling. Worksheets and certificates or computer printouts from this type of sampling shall show supervised sampling.
     </p>
     <p>
      8. “Submitted samples” mean samples that are drawn, marked and controlled by the applicant requesting inspection and submitted to the inspection service for grading results. Work sheets and certificates or computer printouts from this type of sampling shall show “submitted sample.”
     </p>
     <p>
      9. Any handler of potatoes requesting grade or quality inspections from the federal/state inspection service using sampling methods other than official sampling shall notify all financially interested parties.
     </p>
     <p>
      10. Any processor, packer or shipper of potatoes who uses other than the official sampling as defined in this chapter, shall notify the grower of this fact. The penalties for any deviation in sampling procedures or for tampering with a sample or altering a certificate are provided in section 22-912, Idaho Code.

       Although the power to sue and be sued has not been conferred upon the commission, the commission is an independent self-governing state agency which is financed through its own taxing power and which has the traditionally nongovernmental function of carrying out advertising and promotion; so, therefore, the commission was the real party in interest in a suit for infringement of the trademark “Idaho.” Idaho Potato Comm’n v.

        This section was amended by two 1994 acts — ch. 48, § 3, effective July 1, 1994 and ch. 180, § 15, effective January 2, 1995 contingent on the adoption of S.J.R. 109 at the 1994 general election — which do not appear to conflict and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1994 amendment, by ch. 48, § 3, substituted “require” for “arrange for” near the beginning of subdivision (9); and in subdivision (10), inserted “mislabeling” following “misrepresentation,” and added “and to require the disclosure of the growing area of origin upon potato containers by all persons doing business in the state of Idaho.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1994 amendment, by ch. 180, § 15, in subdivision (5), substituted “by the state controller” for “and audit by the state auditor”.

       Any person who shall violate or aid in the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, any rules promulgated pursuant thereto, or the terms of any licensing agreement may be assessed a civil penalty by the commission or its duly authorized agent of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each offense and a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day of continuing violation of such statute or rule or licensing agreement and shall be liable for investigatory costs and attorney’s fees reasonably incurred by the commission in connection with the violation.

       Procedure. No civil penalty may be assessed unless the person charged was given notice and opportunity for a hearing pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. If the commission or its agent is unable to collect such civil penalty or if any person fails to pay all or a set portion of the civil penalty as determined by the commission or its agent, it may enforce its penalty by action in the appropriate district court. Any person against whom the commission or its agent has assessed a civil penalty pursuant to this section may, within twenty-eight (28) days of the final agency action making the assessment, appeal the assessment in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. All penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid into the general fund of the Idaho potato commission. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to preclude the commission from pursuing any other civil or criminal remedies available to it as provided by law.

      <li id="t22c19s22-1902ol11">
       The purpose of this chapter is to address the concerns about the increasing threat of invasive species by providing policy direction, planning and authority to combat invasive species infestations throughout the state and to prevent the introduction of new species that may be harmful;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c19s22-1902ol12">
       The land, water and other resources of Idaho are being severely affected by invasions of an increasing number of harmful, invasive species;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c19s22-1902ol13">
       These invasions are damaging Idaho’s environment and causing economic hardships;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c19s22-1902ol14">
       Idaho is a national leader in the control of invasive species, particularly noxious weeds and agricultural pests, and has a strong network of local, state, federal, tribal and private entities actively and cooperatively combating the threat;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c19s22-1902ol15">
       Prevention, early detection, rapid response and eradication are the most effective and least costly strategies against invasive species because they combat new invasions before they expand beyond feasible control;
      </li>
      <li id="t22c19s22-1902ol16">
       Implementing these strategies requires the state of Idaho to enhance its capacity to prioritize risks, prevent new invasions, employ early detection and rapid response techniques, apply state of the art control and management strategies, coordinate multiple public and private efforts and involve the public;
      </li>

       The multitude of public and private entities with an interest in controlling and preventing the spread of harmful invasive species in Idaho need a mechanism for cooperation and collaboration to meet the threat of invasive species.

      § 22-1912. Control and eradication costs — Deficiency warrants — Cooperation with other entities and citizens.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the director determines that there exists the threat of an infestation of an invasive species on state-owned land or water, private, forested, range or agricultural land or water, and that the infestation is of such a character as to be a menace to state, private, range, forest or agricultural land or water, the director shall cause the infestation to be controlled and eradicated, using such moneys as have been appropriated or may hereafter be made available for such purposes. Provided however, that whenever the cost of control and eradication exceeds the moneys appropriated or otherwise available for that purpose, the state board of examiners may authorize the issuance of deficiency warrants against the general fund for up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) in any one (1) year for such control and eradication. Control and eradication costs may include, but are not limited to, costs for survey, detection, inspection, enforcement, diagnosis, treatment and disposal of infected or infested materials, cleaning and disinfecting of infected premises or vessels and indemnity paid to owners for infected or infested materials destroyed by order of the director. The director, in executing the provisions of this chapter insofar as it relates to control and eradication, shall have the authority to cooperate with federal, state, county and municipal agencies and private citizens in control and eradication efforts; provided, that in the case of joint federal/state programs, state moneys shall only be used to pay the state’s share of the cost of the control and eradication efforts. Such moneys for which the state shall thus become liable shall be paid as a part of the expenses of the Idaho state department of agriculture out of appropriations that shall be made by the legislature for that purpose from the general fund of the state. In all appropriations hereafter made for expenses of the department, account shall be taken of and provision made for this item of expense.

     <p>
      The director may promulgate quarantine rules, whereby the production, movement or existence of plants, or any other article or material, or the normal activity of persons, is brought under rules, in order that the introduction or spread of a plant pest may be prevented or limited, or in order that a plant pest already introduced may be officially controlled, thereby reducing or avoiding an economic impact that would otherwise occur through damage done by the pest or through continuing cost of control measures.

       Federal quarantine. The department may enter into cooperative agreements with the U.S. department of agriculture, and other federal, state, city or county agencies to assist in the enforcement of federal quarantines. The department may establish a quarantine and promulgate a rule against a plant pest or an area not covered by a federal quarantine. The department may seize, destroy or require treatment of products moved from a federally regulated area if they were not moved in accordance with the federal quarantine rules or, if certified, they were found to be infested with the plant pest.

         Parallel state interior quarantine. The department may establish a parallel state interior quarantine against a plant pest which is of limited distribution in the state and is the subject of a federal quarantine. The quarantine regulates intrastate movement between quarantined and nonquarantined areas of the state. This quarantine action is required if the federal quarantine is to apply only to the infested portion of the state.

         Uniform state quarantine. The department may establish a uniform state quarantine with other infested states which are parallel with respect to their basic quarantine requirements. The regulated area in the uniform state quarantine shall describe the area to be regulated. The quarantine shall include a reference to regulated areas of all the infested states under the uniform state quarantine. When a plant pest of regional or national significance occurs only in limited areas of the state and no federal quarantine is established, a state interior quarantine shall be established.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature recognizes the fact that in order to produce crops that are free from plant pests, and to control such plant pests, it is frequently necessary to apply certain crop management practices over an area which may include several farms, orchards, nurseries or other crop producing entities. Such practices may include, but are not limited to, use of clean seed, destruction of infested or undesirable plants, use of chemicals and prohibiting introduction of host materials. The legislature further recognizes that it is in the public interest that the director be authorized to designate certain areas as crop management areas and to stipulate those practices which shall be followed in the management area insofar as they affect the particular crop.

      Whenever the director determines that there exists the threat of an infestation of grasshoppers, crickets or exotic plant pests on state-owned land, private, range or agricultural land, and that the infestation is of such a character as to be a menace to state, private, range or agricultural land, the director shall cause the infestation to be controlled and eradicated, using such funds as have been appropriated or may hereafter be made available for such purposes. Provided however, that whenever the cost of control and eradication exceeds the funds appropriated or otherwise available for that purpose, the state board of examiners may authorize the issuance of deficiency warrants against the general fund for up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) in any one (1) year for such control and eradication. Control and eradication costs may include, but are not limited to, costs for survey, detection, inspection, diagnosis, treatment, and disposal of infected or infested plants and plant materials, cleaning and disinfecting of infected premises and indemnity paid to owners for infected or infested plants and plant materials destroyed by order of the director. The director, in executing the provisions of this chapter insofar as it relates to control and eradication, shall have the authority to cooperate with federal, state, county and municipal agencies and private citizens in control and eradication efforts; provided, that in the case of joint federal/state programs the state funds shall only be used to pay the state’s share of the cost of the control and eradication efforts. Such moneys as the state shall thus become liable for shall be paid as a part of the expenses of the department of agriculture out of appropriations which shall be made by the legislature for that purpose from the general fund of the state. In all appropriations hereafter made for expenses of the department of agriculture, account shall be taken of and provision made for this item of expense.

       The registrant of soil amendments or plant amendments distributed for sale or other remuneration in this state shall pay to the department a tonnage fee of fifteen cents (15¢) per ton on a dry weight basis. For liquid formulations or ingredients, the tonnage fee shall be based on weight-per-gallon basis.

       Every registrant who distributes soil amendments or plant amendments in the state shall file with the department an annual statement for the reporting period setting forth the number of net tons of each soil amendment or plant amendment distributed in this state during the reporting period. The statement is due on or before thirty (30) days following the close of the filing period and, upon filing the statement, the registrant shall pay the tonnage fee at the rate stated in this section. If the tonnage report is not filed and the tonnage fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after the end of the specified filing period, a collection fee of ten percent (10%) of the amount due, or twenty-five dollars ($25.00), whichever is greater, shall be assessed against the registrant and added to the amount due.

       The registrant is ultimately responsible for paying tonnage fees. When more than one (1) person is involved in the distribution of a soil amendment or plant amendment, the last person who has the soil amendment or plant amendment registered or who has distributed a soil amendment or plant amendment to a nonregistrant, dealer or consumer is responsible for reporting the tonnage and paying the tonnage fee, unless the report and payment are made by a prior distributor of the soil amendment or plant amendment.

     <p>
      The Idaho based bee industry has a need for inspections and certification in order to transport bees into other states for pollination; there is a further need to minimize the presence of bee pests and diseases within the state. Therefore, it is declared to be public policy of the state of Idaho to provide a qualified inspection service within the department of agriculture, to issue rules setting fees for such services and to take such action to control pests and diseases of bees as the resources provided under this chapter support.

If the levy of the registration fee is changed, the levy of the registration fee will continue annually at the changed rate until again changed by another referendum. Any resident of Idaho who is registered under this chapter as an Idaho beekeeper with the Idaho department of agriculture may vote at such referendum.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any individual who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the department and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. The review may be obtained by filing in the district court within thirty (30) days following the action of the director a written petition praying that such action be set aside. A copy of such petition shall forthwith be delivered to the director and within thirty (30) days thereafter, the director shall certify and file in the district court of the area affected a transcript of any record pertaining thereto, including a transcript of evidence received at any hearing of referendum. The district court shall give notice by United States mail, to the director and to the petitioner or petitioners of the time and place at which the court will hear such petition, at which time any interested party may be heard. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall affirm, set aside or modify the action of the director, except that the finding of the director as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.

        The earlier cooperative marketing act was not prevailed over by the later track buyers act (now repealed) as each statute was general in its application to all persons and organizations falling within its scope and purpose; likewise each was special in that each dealt with a distinct and particular class of persons and organizations concerned in the marketing of farm products, the types of persons and organizations concerned in these statutes being wholly different and distinct each from the other as was also the legislative objective of each and there was no inconsistency or conflict between them that would effect a repeal or amendment of the earlier act.

It was held that a permit to run a cotton gin could not be issued to a cooperative corporation with capital stock and provision for making profit any more than to anyone else, without a showing of public necessity. The Idaho statute was cited in the dissenting opinion as an illustration of cooperative marketing acts which provide that associations formed thereunder may organize either with or without capital stock.

       The earlier cooperative marketing act is not prevailed over by the later track buyers act (now repealed) as each statute is general in its application to all persons and organizations falling within its scope and purpose, likewise each is special in that each deals with a distinct and particular class of persons and organizations concerned in the marketing of farm products, the types of persons and organizations concerned in these statutes being wholly different and distinct each from the other as is also the legislative objective of each and there is no inconsistency or conflict between them that would effect a repeal or amendment of the earlier act.

    The interest of an existing or former member in the association’s capital reserve or equity accounts is an equity interest and not a debt, and is revolvable in the manner defined in the bylaws and subject to the restrictions defined therein. The issuance of notices of allocation and/or of equity reserve balances, or any other form sufficient to place the existing or former member on notice of his equity interest in the association shall satisfy the recording, appraisal, notification and/or payment requirement hereinabove set forth or as set forth in the bylaws. Revolving of capital reserve or equity accounts shall be at the discretion of the board of directors and the bylaws may specifically so provide.

      The affairs of the association shall be managed by a board of not less than five (5) directors, elected by the members or stockholders from their own number. The bylaws may provide that the territory in which the association has members shall be divided into districts and that the directors shall be elected according to such districts. In such a case the bylaws shall specify the number of directors to be elected by each district, the manner and method of reapportioning the directors and of redistricting the territory covered by the association. The bylaws may provide that primary elections should be held in each district to elect the directors apportioned to such districts and the result of all such primary elections must be ratified by the next regular meeting of the association.

     <p>
      The bylaws may provide that one or more directors may be appointed by the department of agriculture or any other public official or commission. The director or directors so appointed need not be members or stockholders of the association, but shall have the same powers and rights as other directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      An association may provide a fair remuneration for the time actually spent by its officers and directors in its service. No director, during the term of his office, shall be a party to a contract for a profit with the association differing in any way from the business relations accorded regular members or holders of common stock of the association, or to any other kind of contract differing from terms generally current in that district.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a vacancy on the board of directors occurs, other than by expiration of term, the remaining members of the board, by a majority vote, shall fill the vacancy, unless the bylaws provide for an election of directors by district. [In] such a case the board of directors shall immediately call a special meeting of the members or stockholders in that district to fill the vacancy.

     <p>
      Any member may bring charges against an officer or director by filing them in writing with the secretary of the association, together with a petition signed by ten percent (10%) of the members, requesting the removal of the officer or director in question. The removal shall be voted upon at the next regular or special meeting of the association and, by a vote of a majority of the members, the association may remove the officer or director and fill the vacancy. The director or officer against whom such charges have been brought shall be informed in writing of the charges previous to the meeting and shall have an opportunity at the meeting to be heard in person or by counsel and to present witnesses; and the person or persons bringing the charges against him shall have the same opportunity.

      In case the bylaws provide for election of directors by districts with primary elections in each district, then the petition for removal of a director must be signed by twenty percent (20%) of the members residing in the district from which he is elected. The board of directors must call a special meeting of the members residing in that district to consider the removal of the director. By a vote of the majority of the members of that district, the director in question shall be removed from office.

     <p>
      When the board of directors of an association shall consist of five (5) or more members, in lieu of electing the whole number of directors annually, the articles of incorporation or by laws may provide that the directors be divided into either two (2) or three (3) classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, the term of office of directors of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of members after their election, that of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting after their election, and that of the third class, if any, to expire at the third annual meeting after their election. At each annual meeting after such classification the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of such meeting shall be elected to hold office until the second succeeding annual meeting, if there be two (2) classes, or until the third succeeding annual meeting, if there be three (3) classes. No classification of directors shall be effective prior to the first annual meeting of members.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol11">
       Any twenty-five (25) owners of land lying within the limits of the territory proposed to be organized into a district may file a petition with the state soil and water conservation commission asking that a soil conservation district be organized to function in the territory described in the petition. Such petition shall set forth:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol11a">
         The proposed name of said district;
        </li>
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol11b">
         That there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, for a soil conservation district to function in the territory described in the petition;
        </li>
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol11c">
         A description of the territory proposed to be organized as a district, which description shall not be required to be given by metes and bounds or by legal subdivisions, but shall be deemed sufficient if generally accurate;
        </li>
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol11d">
         A request that the state soil and water conservation commission duly define the boundaries for such district; that a referendum be held within the territory so defined on the question of the creation of a soil conservation district in such territory; and that the commission determine that such a district be created.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol12">
       Within thirty (30) days after such petition has been filed with the state soil and water conservation commission, it shall cause due notice to be given of a proposed hearing upon the question of the desirability and necessity, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, of the creation of such district, upon the question of the appropriate boundaries to be assigned to such district, upon the propriety of the petition and other proceedings taken under this chapter, and upon all questions relevant to such inquiries. All owners of land within the limits of the territory described in the petition, and of lands within any territory considered for addition to such described territory, and all other interested parties, shall have the right to attend such hearings and to be heard. If it shall appear upon the hearing that it may be desirable to include within the proposed district territory outside of the area within which due notice of the hearing has been given the hearing shall be adjourned and the due notice of further hearing shall be given throughout the entire area considered for inclusion in the district, and such further hearing held. After such hearing, if the commission shall determine upon the facts presented at such hearing and upon such other relevant facts and information as may be available, that there is need in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, for a soil conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall make and record such determination, and shall define by metes and bounds or by legal subdivisions, the boundaries of such district. In making such determination and in defining such boundaries, the commission shall give due weight and consideration to the topography of the area considered and of the state, the composition of soils therein, the distribution of erosion, the prevailing land use practices, the desirability and necessity of including within the boundaries the particular lands under consideration and the benefits such lands may receive from being included within such boundaries, the relation of the proposed area to the existing watersheds and agricultural regions, and to other soil conservation districts already organized or proposed for organization under the provisions of this chapter, and such other physical, geographical, and economic factors as are relevant, having due regard to the legislature determinations set forth in section 22-2716, Idaho Code. The territory to be included within such boundaries need not be contiguous. If the commission determines after such hearing, after due consideration of the said relevant facts, that there is no need for a soil conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall make and record such determination and shall deny the petition. After six (6) months shall have expired from the date of the denial of such petition, subsequent petitions covering the same or substantially the same territory may be filed as aforesaid and new hearings held and determinations made thereon.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol13">
       After the commission has made and recorded a determination that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, for the organization of a district in a particular territory and has defined the boundaries thereof, it shall consider the question whether the operation of a district within such boundaries with the powers conferred upon soil conservation districts in this chapter is administratively practicable and feasible. To assist the commission in the determination of such administrative practicability and feasibility, it shall be the duty of the commission, at the next election held after entry of the finding that there is need for the organization of the proposed district and the determination of the boundaries thereof, to hold a referendum, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, within the proposed district upon the proposition of the creation of the district, and to cause notice of such election to be given as provided in section 34-1406, Idaho Code. The question shall be submitted by ballots upon which the words “For creation of a soil conservation district of the lands below described and lying in the county(ies) of .... and ....” and “Against creation of a soil conservation district of the lands below described and lying in the county(ies) of .... and ....” shall appear, with a square before each proposition and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before one or the other of said propositions as the voter may favor or oppose creation of such district. The ballot shall set forth the boundaries of such proposed district as determined by the commission. All qualified electors who own lands or reside within the proposed district shall be eligible to vote in said referendum.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol14">
       The commission shall pay all expenses for the issuance of such notice and the conduct of such hearings and election and shall supervise the conduct of such hearings and election. It shall issue appropriate regulations governing the conduct of such hearings and election. No informalities in the conduct of the election or in any matter relating thereto shall invalidate the election or the result thereof if notice thereof shall have been given substantially as herein provided and the election shall have been fairly conducted.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol15">
       The commission shall publish the result of the election and shall thereafter consider and determine whether the operation of the district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable and feasible. If the commission determines that the operation of such district is not administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and deny the petition. If the commission determines that the operation of such district is administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and shall proceed with the organization of the district in the manner hereinafter provided. In making such determination the commission shall give due regard and weight to the attitudes of the owners of lands lying within the defined boundaries, the number of landowners and qualified electors eligible to vote in the election who shall have voted, the proportion of the votes cast in the election in favor of the creation of the district to the total number of votes cast, the approximate wealth and income of the landowners of the proposed district, the probable expense of carrying on erosion control and other conservation operations within such district, and such other economic and social factors as may be relevant to such determination, having due regard to the legislative determination set forth in section 22-2716, Idaho Code; provided however, the commission shall not have authority to determine that the operation of the proposed district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable and feasible unless at least a majority of the votes cast in the election upon the proposition of creation of the district shall have been cast in favor of the creation of such district.
    (6) If the commission determines that the operation of the proposed district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable and feasible, it shall appoint two (2) supervisors to act, with the three (3) supervisors elected as provided hereinafter, as the governing body of the district. Such district shall be a governmental subdivision of this state and a public body corporate and politic, upon the taking of the following proceedings:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol15a">
         The two (2) appointed supervisors shall present to the secretary of state an application signed by them which shall set forth (and such application need contain no detail other than the mere recitals): (i) that a petition for the creation of the district was filed with the state soil and water conservation commission pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and that the proceedings specified in this chapter were taken pursuant to such petition; that the application is being filed in order to complete the organization of the district as a governmental subdivision and a public body, corporate and politic, under this chapter; and that the commission has appointed them as supervisors; (ii) the name and official residence of each of the supervisors, together with a certified copy of the appointments evidencing their right to office; (iii) the term of office of each of the supervisors; (iv) the name which is proposed for the district; and (v) the location of the principal office of the supervisors of the district. The application shall be subscribed and sworn to by each of the said supervisors before an officer authorized by the laws of this state to take and certify oaths, who shall certify upon the application that he personally knows the supervisors and knows them to be the officers as affirmed in the application, and that each has subscribed thereto in the officer’s presence.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol15b">
         The application shall be accompanied by a statement by the state soil and water conservation commission, which shall certify (and such statement need contain no detail other than the mere recitals) that a petition was filed, notice issued and hearing held as aforesaid; that the commission did duly determine that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, for a soil conservation district to function in the proposed territory and did define the boundaries thereof; that notice was given and an election held on the question of the creation of such district, and that the result of the election showed a sixty percent (60%) majority of the votes cast in the election to be in favor of the creation of the district; that thereafter the commission did duly determine that the operation of the proposed district is administratively practicable and feasible. The said statement shall set forth the boundaries of the district as they have been defined by the commission.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol15c">
         The secretary of state shall examine the application and statement and, if he finds that the name proposed for the district is not identical with that of any other soil conservation district of this state or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion or uncertainty, he shall receive and file them and shall record them in an appropriate book of record in his office.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c27s22-2719ol15d">
         If the secretary of state finds that the name proposed for the district is identical with that of any other soil conservation district of this state, or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty, he shall certify such fact to the state soil and water conservation commission which shall thereupon submit to the secretary of state a new name for the said district, which shall not be subject to such defects. Upon receipt of such new name free of such defects, the secretary of state shall record the application and statement with the name so modified, in an appropriate book of record in his office. When the application and statement have been made, filed and recorded, as herein provided, the district shall constitute a governmental subdivision of this state and a public body corporate and politic. The secretary of state shall make and issue to the said supervisors a certificate under the seal of the state, of the due organization of the said district, and shall record such certificate with the application and statement. The boundaries of such district shall include the territory as determined by the state soil and water conservation commission as aforesaid, but in no event shall they include any area included within the boundaries of another soil conservation district organized under the provisions of this chapter except as provided in section 22-2720, Idaho Code.
    (7) After six (6) months shall have expired from the date of entry of a determination by the state soil and water conservation commission that operation of a proposed district is not administratively practicable and feasible, and denial of a petition pursuant to such determination, subsequent petitions may be filed as aforesaid, and action taken thereon in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Where more than one (1) petition is filed covering parts of the same territory, the state soil and water conservation commission may consolidate all of any such petitions.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) Petitions for including additional territory within an existing district may be filed with the state soil and water conservation commission and the proceedings herein provided for in the case of petitions to organize a district shall be observed in the case of petitions for such inclusion. The commission shall prescribe the form for such petitions, which shall be as nearly as may be in the form prescribed in this chapter for petitions to organize a district. Where the total number of landowners in the area proposed for inclusion is less than twenty-five (25), the petition may be filed when signed by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the owners of such area, and in such case no election need be held. In elections upon petitions for such inclusion, all owners of land and qualified electors lying within the proposed additional area shall be eligible to vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) Incorporated cities, not already included within a district, may be included by presentation of a request of the district approved by the governing body along with a request of the city approved by the mayor and council, to the state soil and water conservation commission. The commission shall consider and act on such joint request at the earliest convenience. If the joint request is denied, the commission shall so notify the district and city in writing and state the reasons for such denial. After six (6) months shall have expired from the date of denial of such joint request, a subsequent joint request may again be made. If the joint request is approved, the commission shall then cause the necessary papers to be filed with the secretary of state. This shall include an amended legal description of the boundaries of the total district.

       Petitions for consolidating two (2) or more existing districts or for deleting territory from one (1) or more existing districts and adding the deleted territory to one (1) or more existing districts or incorporating the deleted territory into a new district or districts may be filed with the state soil and water conservation commission on such forms as may be prescribed by the state soil and water conservation commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2720ol12">
       The petitions provided for in subsection (1) of this section shall be signed by twenty-five (25) landowners in the area proposed to be consolidated or the area proposed to be deleted plus the district or districts to which it is to be added or the territory which is to be included in a new district or districts, as the case may be. Provided however, if two-thirds (2/3) of the landowners of all such territory total less than twenty-five (25), then such lesser number of signatures will suffice for the petition.

       Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such a petition, the state soil and water conservation commission shall cause due notice of hearing on the matter to be given in all of the areas concerned.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2720ol14">
       At the close of the hearing, the state soil and water conservation commission shall make and record the following determinations:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t22c27s22-2720ol14a">
         Whether or not, in the opinion of the commission, the proposal set forth by the petition would serve the public health, safety and welfare.

       If either or both of the determinations made under subsection (4) of this section are in the negative, the matter is closed. Provided however, after six (6) months have expired from the date of such determination, a new petition may be filed involving substantially the same proposals.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c27s22-2720ol16">
       If both of the determinations made under subsection (4) of this section are in the affirmative and if the proposal involves the consolidation of two (2) or more existing districts or if the proposal involves the deletion of territory from one (1) or more districts and the addition of that territory to another existing district or districts, then the commission shall proceed to effect the change as per the commission’s determinations hereinbefore referred to. The state soil and water conservation commission shall effect the change by filing with the secretary of state a sworn statement of a member of the commission stating:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t22c27s22-2720ol16a">
         The name of the district or districts which are consolidated, if any;

         A description of the boundaries of the consolidated district or of the territory remaining in the district or districts deleted from and the district or districts added to, according to the commission’s determination.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      From and after the time of filing of such statement with the secretary of state, the changes will be effective. If the name of a district formed by the consolidation of two (2) or more existing districts differs from that of either of the consolidated districts, the secretary of state shall issue and record a new certificate of organization of said district.
    (7) Within ten (10) days after the filing of a statement providing for the formation of a consolidated district as prescribed in subsection (6) of this section, the supervisors of each district involved in the consolidation shall meet and, from their number, shall designate a chairman of the consolidated district. Incumbent supervisors of districts involved in a consolidation may serve until any such supervisor’s term expires. Any vacancy on the governing body of a district formed by consolidation shall not be filled until only five (5) supervisors, or seven (7) upon written request pursuant to section 22-2721, Idaho Code, remain on the governing body of such district. Thereafter, vacancies shall be filled consistent with procedures prescribed in section 22-2721, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) A district formed by the consolidation of two (2) or more districts shall receive a sum not to exceed eight thousand five hundred dollars ($8,500) for each district involved in the formation of the consolidated district for a period of three (3) years after the formation of such district. The maximum allocation of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per district set forth in section 22-2727, Idaho Code, shall not apply to a district formed by consolidation for a period of three (3) years following the formation of such district. Upon expiration of the three (3) year time period, a district formed by consolidation shall be treated as one (1) district and shall be subject to all provisions of section 22-2727, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) The office of any district supervisor is hereby declared to be vacant when, after the deletion of territory, such district supervisor is no longer a landowner within the district deleted from.
     </p>
     <p>
      (10) If both of the determinations made under subsection (4) of this section are in the affirmative and if the proposal involves the addition of territory deleted from one (1) or more existing districts to other territory thus forming a new district, a referendum shall be held and other procedures followed as in cases involving the original formation of a district where no existing district is involved. In such a case, due notice shall be given in the area which may comprise the new district.
     </p>
     <p>
      (11) If a new district is formed under the procedure prescribed in subsection (10) of this section, part of the area which is composed of an old district, the state soil and water conservation commission shall cause to be filed with the secretary of state a sworn statement of a member of the commission stating:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) The name of the district or districts deleted from; and
     </p>

Provided however, that any hobbyist beekeeper who desires to support the efforts of the commission, as set forth in section 22-2807, Idaho Code, and desires to be included in registration lists distributed as authorized under section 22-2815, Idaho Code, may register with the commission for that purpose by remitting an annual registration fee of ten dollars ($10.00).
      </li>
      <li id="t22c28s22-2809ol12">
       The tax may be decreased to not less than three cents (3¢) per hive or colony per year or it may be increased to not more than ten cents (10¢) per hive or colony per year, if approved by a majority of the beekeepers voting in a referendum held for the purpose of determining whether such levy of the tax shall or shall not be changed. If the levy of the tax is changed, the levy of the tax will continue annually at the changed rate until again changed by another referendum. Any resident of Idaho who is a registered Idaho beekeeper with the department of agriculture, and is not exempt from taxation as provided in subsection (1) of this section, may vote at such referendum. Any referendum held for the purpose of changing the levy of such tax shall be held at the annual meeting of the Idaho honey industry association or any successor organization to this group.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c28s22-2809ol13">
       Notice of the tax provided for in this section shall be mailed no later than June 1 and the tax shall be due and payable on or before July 1 of each year, and it shall be collected by the Idaho department of agriculture and shall forthwith be paid over by the Idaho department of agriculture to the Idaho honey fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c28s22-2809ol14">
       Said tax shall be a lien upon all apicultural products, equipment, bees and property of the person owning or controlling such bees and shall be prior to all other liens or encumbrances except liens which are declared prior by operation of the statutes of this state.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c28s22-2809ol15">
       Hives brought into the state for indoor winter storage prior to moving to another state for pollination or honey production are exempt from paying fees and taxes as provided for in this section. Provided however, registration shall be required and a minimum of the following information shall be supplied: location of the storage, approximate dates the hive or hives will be brought into and leave the state, name, address and telephone number of the owner of the bees, and name, address and telephone number of an in-state contact who will have knowledge of the hive or hives being stored in the state.

     <p>
      The production of beans is one of the major agricultural activities of the state of Idaho. Idaho beans are equal, if not superior, to beans grown elsewhere in the United States. However, because the bean industry in this state has failed to adequately advertise, develop and improve the superior quality of Idaho beans on a nationwide scale, this state does not enjoy its fair share of the national bean market. In the interests of the welfare and general prosperity of the people of this state, to avoid further unnecessary losses in the national bean market, and to carry on research into the growth, production and marketing of beans in Idaho, in order that the health-giving qualities and food value of our beans may become well-known throughout the United States, it is the purpose of this act to provide for and promote national advertising of Idaho beans, and to further provide for comprehensive studies and research analyses into the future production, growing, and marketing of Idaho beans.

      § 22-2921. Tax levy.
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby levied and imposed a tax of twelve cents (12¢) per hundredweight on beans covered by this act, which tax shall be due on or before the time when such beans are first handled in the primary channels of trade and shall be paid at such time or times as the commission may by rule or regulation prescribe, but not later than the 15th day of the month next succeeding the three (3) month period in which such beans were handled in the primary channels of trade. The commission shall designate the quarters (three (3) month periods) for the purpose of collection of this tax.
     </p>
     <p>
      The person first introducing beans into primary channels of trade shall be responsible for payment of the tax. If such person is the dealer or shipper handling beans grown by another he may charge against or recover from the grower of such beans eight cents (8¢) of the cost thereof, but he shall remain liable for and pay four cents (4¢) of the cost thereof. However, if such person is the dealer or handler and is only cleaning the beans for the grower, he shall charge against or recover from the grower the entire tax of twelve cents (12¢) per hundredweight.

      It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination, that economic waste is being fostered in the hop industry of the state of Idaho by the lack of proper advertising and dissemination of information necessary for the development and promotion of the sale of hops grown in the state of Idaho and by the lack of facilities and funds for research on marketing of and markets for hops and for research to improve the quality of hops, to develop and improve control of measures for diseases and pests which attack hops, to improve hop growing culture and to disseminate information to the growers; that hop producing areas in other states are promulgating advertising and promotion campaigns for their products throughout the United States and foreign countries to the extent that hops of this state must be advertised to be able to retain their place on the markets of the United States and foreign countries; and that it is in the interest of the public welfare and general prosperity of the state of Idaho that this avoidable and unnecessary loss of markets to other producing areas be eliminated by the advertising of hops grown in the state of Idaho and that the growers have at their disposal all available information on the best and most advanced methods of growing, harvesting and marketing hops. The purpose of this act is to promote the general welfare of our people by increasing the production of and expanding the market for hops grown in the state of Idaho.

       There is hereby levied an initial assessment of twenty (20) cents per bale on each bale of hops handled in the primary channels of trade.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c31s22-3107ol12">
       In addition to such initial assessment, there is hereby levied an additional assessment of not exceeding four dollars and eighty cents ($4.80) per bale on each bale of hops handled in the primary channels of trade. The amount of such additional assessment, if any, shall be determined by resolution of the commission after February first but before July first of each year and shall be submitted to the growers by referendum. The term “production” for the purposes of this subsection means the number of pounds of hops produced by a grower during the calendar year immediately next preceding each annual registration of growers as herein provided. Each grower, whether an individual, a partnership, a corporation, an association or other business unit, shall have one (1) vote at such referendum. No grower shall vote at any such referendum during any year unless such grower has, after January first but prior to January fifteenth of such year, registered with the commission on forms to be supplied by the commission giving such grower’s name, mailing address and production, except that for the calendar year in which this subsection takes effect, the period for the registration of growers shall be the fifteen (15) days immediately succeeding the effective date of this subsection. The qualifications of any grower to vote or the amount of such grower’s production as shown by such grower’s registration may be challenged by any other grower qualified to vote or any member of the commission. All such challenges shall be presented to the commission in writing within ten (10) days after the close of registration and shall be heard and determined by the commission prior to canvassing the returns of any such referendum. After the adoption of a resolution by the commission fixing the amount of the additional assessment to be submitted to a referendum of the growers, the commission shall cause to be mailed by United States registered mail to each grower so registered, at the address appearing on such grower’s registration, a ballot setting forth the name of such grower, the grower’s production, a copy of the resolution so adopted, and the words, “For additional assessment as provided in the foregoing resolution” followed by a circle and the words “Against the additional assessment as provided in the foregoing resolution” followed by a circle and such ballot shall provide a space at the bottom thereof for the grower’s signature. A grower desiring to vote upon the amount of the additional assessment shall mark the ballot received to express the grower’s vote, shall sign the ballot and shall return the ballot to the commission within twenty (20) days after the date on which the ballot was mailed to the grower by the commission. Any ballot which is not returned within such time limit, or which is not voted, or which is not signed, or which is marked both for and against the question submitted, shall be deemed not to have been voted and shall not be counted for any purpose. The commission shall meet and canvass all ballots cast at any such referendum within ten (10) days after the date by which all ballots are herein required to be returned to the commission. Upon the canvass, if the commission finds that two-thirds (2/3) or more of the growers voting at such referendum have voted in favor of the amount of such additional assessment and that growers representing two-thirds (2/3) or more of the production of all growers voting at such referendum have voted in favor of the amount of such additional assessment, then the amount of such additional assessment shall have been approved, but if the commission finds otherwise, then the amount of such additional assessment shall have failed. The commission shall record the results of each canvass in its official records and shall retain all election records, grower registrations and ballots for one (1) year after the date of such canvass when it may cause the same to be destroyed. If the canvass shows that the amount of such additional assessment shall have been approved, the commission shall immediately adopt a resolution levying the amount thereof. Such additional assessment when so levied shall apply only to the bales of hops grown during the calendar year in which the referendum approving the same was held, but shall so apply regardless of the calendar year in which such bales of hops are first handled in the primary channels of trade. If the canvass shows that the amount of such additional assessment shall have failed, the commission shall not levy the amount thereof, but the commission may re-submit the same or another amount for such additional assessment to the growers by referendum as herein provided as often as the commission deems necessary.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c31s22-3107ol13">
       All assessments levied under this act shall be due on or before the time when such hops are first handled in the primary channels of trade and shall be paid at such time or times as the commission may by rule or regulation prescribe, but not later than the last day of the month next succeeding the month in which such hops were first handled in the primary channels of trade.

       From and after the first day of July, 2012, there is hereby levied and imposed a tax not to exceed five cents (5¢) per bushel on all wheat grown in the state of Idaho or given to Idaho growers under a crop reduction program, and sold or contracted through commercial channels, and each and every crop grown or wheat given to growers under a crop reduction program thereafter. The tax shall be due on wheat given to growers under a crop reduction program and sold or contracted through commercial channels, regardless of any deduction of the tax on this same wheat prior to it being given to the grower. The tax shall be due on or before the time when such wheat is first sold or contracted in the commercial channels and shall be paid at such time or times as the commission may, by rule, prescribe, as hereinafter provided, but not later than the 15th day of the month next succeeding the three (3) month period in which such wheat is sold or contracted in commercial channels. The commission shall designate the quarters (three (3) month periods) for the purpose of collection of this tax.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c33s22-3315ol12">
       The tax shall be levied and assessed to the grower at the time of delivery for sale and shall be deducted by the first purchaser from the price paid to the grower at the time of sale or in case of a lienholder who may possess such wheat under his lien, the tax shall be deducted by the lienholder from the proceeds of the claim secured by such lien at the time the wheat is pledged or mortgaged. The tax shall be deducted as provided in this section whether the wheat is stored in this or any other state. The commission may, however, permit any federal corporation, such as the commodity credit corporation, to waive its responsibility for the collection of the tax, provided the amount of the tax is one dollar ($1.00) or less.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c33s22-3315ol13">
       It shall be within the discretion of the commission to establish the amount of the tax to be levied. The amount of the tax to be levied shall not exceed five cents (5¢) per bushel for any fiscal year. The decision whether to adjust the amount of the tax to be levied and the time for which the adjusted levy shall be in effect shall require the vote of a majority of the commission members.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c33s22-3315ol14">
       The tax constitutes a lien prior to all other liens and encumbrances upon such wheat except liens which are declared prior by operation of a statute of this state.

      <li id="t22c33s22-3315ol15">
       Any person or firm who makes payment to the commission at a date later than that prescribed in this section may be subject to a late payment penalty as set forth by the commission by rule. Such penalty shall not exceed the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum on the amount due. In addition to the above penalty, the commission shall be entitled to recover all costs, fees, and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in the collection of the tax and penalty provided for in this section.

       In negligence action by farmer against pesticide contractor, district court did not err when it instructed the jury that a violation of the standard of conduct defined in subsections (1) and (2) of this section constituted negligence per se. Obendorf v. Terra Hug Spray Co. Inc., 145 Idaho 892, 188 P.3d 834 (2008).

       From and after July 1, 1997, there is hereby levied and imposed an assessment of an amount not to be less than one percent (1%) nor to exceed two percent (2%) of the net receipts at the first point of sale, to be deducted by the first purchaser from the price paid to the grower on dry peas or lentils grown in Idaho, or chickpeas or garbanzos grown north of the Salmon River, sold after July 1, 1997, dockage free weight, and sold or contracted through commercial channels, and each and every crop grown thereafter. The assessment provided in this subsection shall be paid at such time or times as the commission may by rule prescribe.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c35s22-3515ol12">
       The assessment shall be levied and assessed to the grower at the time of delivery for sale and shall be deducted by the first purchaser from the price paid to the grower at the time of sale or in case of a lienholder who may possess such peas or lentils under his lien, the assessment shall be deducted by the lienholder from the proceeds of the claims secured by such lien at the time the peas or lentils are pledged or mortgaged. The assessment shall be deducted as provided in this section whether the peas or lentils are stored in this or any other state. The commission may, however, permit any federal corporation, such as the commodity credit corporation, to waive its responsibility for the collection of the assessment, provided the amount of the assessment is one dollar ($1.00) or less.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c35s22-3515ol13">
       It shall be within the discretion of the commission to establish the amount of the tax to be levied as provided in subsection (1) of this section. The decision whether to adjust the amount of the tax to be levied and the time for which the adjusted levy shall be in effect shall require the vote of a majority of the commission members.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c35s22-3515ol14">
       The assessment shall be levied on peas and lentils grown and delivered on seed or grower contracts. The assessment shall be levied and assessed to the grower at the time of settlement and shall be deducted by the seed company, corporation, cooperative, partnership, or person from the price paid to the grower at the time of settlement for fulfillment of conditions as set forth in grower contracts.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c35s22-3515ol15">
       The assessment shall not be levied on peas and lentils retained and used by the grower for his own seed and feed.

     <ol>
      <li id="t22c38s22-3806ol11">
       The commission is hereby empowered to levy an assessment not to exceed eight cents (8¢) per pound on each pound of essential oil handled in the primary channels of trade.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c38s22-3806ol12">
       This assessment may be increased to not exceed a total assessment of ten cents (10¢) per pound as determined by a two-thirds (2/3) affirmative vote of the growers voting or a majority of the acreage voting in a referendum to be conducted by mail by the commission. The amount of any increased assessment, if any, shall be determined by resolution of the commission after February 1st or before July 1st of each year. The term “acreage” for the purposes of this subsection, means the number of acres of mint produced by a grower during the calendar year immediately next preceding each annual registration of growers as herein provided. Each grower, whether an individual, a partnership, a corporation, an association or other business unit, shall have one (1) vote at such referendum. No grower shall vote at any such referendum during any year unless such grower has, after January 1st but prior to January 15th of such year, registered with the commission on forms to be supplied by the commission giving such grower’s name, mailing address and acreage, except that for the calendar year in which this subsection takes effect, the periods for the registration of growers shall be the fifteen (15) days immediately succeeding the effective date of this subsection. The qualification of any grower to vote or the amount of such grower’s acreage as shown by such grower’s registration may be challenged by any other grower qualified to vote or any member of the commission. All such challenges shall be presented to the commission in writing within ten (10) days after the close of registration and shall be heard and determined by the commission prior to canvassing the returns of any such referendum. After the adoption of a resolution by the commission fixing the amount of the additional assessment to be submitted to a referendum of the growers, the commission shall cause to be mailed by United States registered mail to each grower so registered, at the address appearing on such grower’s registration, a ballot setting forth the name of such grower, the grower’s acreage, a copy of the resolution so adopted, and the words, “For additional assessment as provided in the foregoing resolution,” followed by a circle and the words “Against the additional assessment as provided in the foregoing resolution,” followed by a circle and such ballot shall provide a space at the bottom thereof for the grower’s signature. A grower desiring to vote upon the amount of the additional assessment shall mark the ballot received to express the grower’s vote, shall sign the ballot and shall return the ballot to the commission within twenty (20) days after the date on which the ballot was mailed to the grower by the commission. Any ballot which is not returned within such time limit, or which is not voted, or which is not signed, or which is marked both for and against the question submitted, shall be deemed not to have been voted and shall not be counted for any purpose. The commission shall meet and canvass all ballots cast at any such referendum within ten (10) days after the date by which all ballots are herein required to be returned to the commission. Upon the canvass, if the commission finds that two-thirds (2/3) or more of the growers voting at such referendum have voted in favor of the amount of such additional assessment or that growers representing a majority or more of the production of all growers voting at such referendum have voted in favor of the amount of such additional assessment, then the amount of such additional assessment shall have been approved, but if the commission finds otherwise, then the amount of such additional assessment shall have failed. The commission shall record the results of each canvass in its official records and shall retain all election records, grower registrations and the ballots for one (1) year after the date of such canvass when it may cause the same to be destroyed. If the canvass shows that the amount of such additional assessment shall have been approved, the commission shall immediately adopt a resolution levying the amount thereof. Such additional assessment when so levied shall apply only to the pounds of mint grown during the calendar year in which the referendum approving the same was held, but shall so apply regardless of the calendar year in which such essential oils are first handled in the primary channels of trade. If the canvass shows that the amount of such additional assessment shall have failed, the commission shall not levy the amount thereof, but the commission may resubmit the same or another amount for such additional assessment to the growers by referendum as herein provided as often as the commission deems necessary.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c38s22-3806ol13">
       All assessments levied under this act shall be due on or before the time when such essential oils are first handled in the primary channels of trade and shall be paid not later than the last day of the month next succeeding the month in which such essential oils were first handled in the primary channels of trade.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c38s22-3806ol14">
       The assessment constitutes a lien prior to all other liens and encumbrances upon such essential oils except liens which are declared prior by operation of a statute of this state, but payment of the assessment by either grower or dealer who first handled such essential oils shall not subject such grower or dealer to liability for a lien prior to the lien herein imposed unless actual notice of such prior lien has been made upon such grower or dealer.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c38s22-3806ol15">
       The commission by order may cancel an assessment which has been delinquent for five (5) years or more if it determines that: (a) the amount of the assessment is less than one dollar ($1.00), and that further collection effort or expense does not justify the collection thereof, or the assessment is wholly uncollectible.

Each application shall be accompanied with a license fee of two hundred dollars ($200) and by good and sufficient surety bond in the penal sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) executed by the applicant [and] as principal and by a surety company authorized to do business in the state of Idaho as surety and conditioned upon the applicant’s full and complete compliance with the provisions of this act and all of the rules and orders of the commission. The commission shall investigate each applicant thoroughly and if the commission is satisfied that the applicant is of good character and reputation and is financially responsible, a license shall be issued for the period ending on the next succeeding first Monday of January, otherwise the application shall be denied. The commission may revoke a license after thirty (30) days’ written notice of its intention so to do, and after providing the licensee with an opportunity for an appropriate contested case in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, if the licensee shall willfully fail to fully and completely comply with the provisions of this act and all of the rules and orders of the commission.

     <p>
      It is to the interest of all the people that the abundant natural resources of Idaho be protected, fully developed and uniformly distributed. Among the agricultural industries of the state of Idaho that contribute to the economic welfare of the state is the barley industry. Because of a surplus of barley grown in this state, and because a surplus during recurrent years has become excessive and difficult to market in the available markets, it is necessary, in order to provide a profitable enterprise for the barley growers of the state and to promote employment of labor and to assist the barley growers and those in the various industries dependent upon the barley growers, that additional markets be found and developed. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health and welfare of the citizens of our state by providing means for the protection, promotion, study, research, analysis and development of markets concerning the growing and marketing of Idaho barley.

     <p>
      It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination, that it is to the best interests of all the people of the state of Idaho that the abundant and natural resources of Idaho be protected, fully developed and uniformly distributed; that economic waste threatens the alfalfa seed and clover seed industries in the state of Idaho by the lack of facilities and funds for research to develop and improve control measures for diseases and pests which attack alfalfa seed and clover seed pollinators, to improve alfalfa seed and clover seed growing culture and to disseminate information to the growers, and by lack of proper advertising and dissemination of information necessary for the development and promotion of alfalfa seed and clover seed grown in the state of Idaho; and that it is in the interests of the people, welfare and general prosperity of the state of Idaho that this avoidable economic waste be eliminated by the growers having at their disposal all available information on the best and most advanced methods of culture, growing, harvesting and marketing of alfalfa seed and clover seed. The purpose of this act is to promote the general welfare of our people by improving the culture and production of and expanding the market for alfalfa seed and clover seed grown in the state of Idaho.

     <p>
      The legislature finds that agricultural activities conducted on farmland in urbanizing areas are often subjected to nuisance lawsuits, and that such suits encourage and even force the premature removal of the lands from agricultural uses, and in some cases prohibit investments in agricultural improvements. It is the intent of the legislature to reduce the loss to the state of its agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance. The legislature also finds that the right to farm is a natural right and is recognized as a permitted use throughout the state of Idaho.

       In a nuisance action brought by citizens claiming that the neighboring feedlot operation was a nuisance because of recent expansions of the operation, the Idaho Right to Farm Act did not protect the expanding agricultural operation from being declared a nuisance because this act applies to the encroachment of “urbanizing areas” and to situations where there have been changes in “surrounding nonagricultural activities” and not to situations in which the expanding agricultural operation is surrounded by an area that has remained substantially unchanged.

      It is in the best interests of the state of Idaho that its abundant natural resources be efficiently used and effectively managed for the benefit of its citizens. The oilseed industry is rapidly developing and significantly contributing to the economic welfare of Idaho. The products provided are an important and nutritious part of the human diet. Domestic demand exceeds what is produced in the United States. Moreover, the world market for oilseeds continues to expand. Idaho farmers are in an excellent position to take advantage of this demand. The university of Idaho leads the nation in research on canola and rapeseed. The research effort is critical to the competitiveness of Idaho growers and must be expanded and enhanced. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health and welfare of the citizens of the state by implementing a program of research, promotion, and consumer and industry information designed to strengthen the position in the marketplace of the Idaho oilseed industry, to expand existing markets, and to develop new markets for oilseed and their products.

       From and after the first day of July 1996, there is hereby levied and imposed a tax of ten cents (10¢) per hundred weight on all oilseed sold or contracted in this state through commercial channels. The tax shall be due on or before the time when the oilseed is first sold or contracted in the commercial channels in this state and shall be paid at the times the commission may by rule prescribe, but not later than the 15th day of the month next succeeding the three (3) month period in which the oilseed is sold or contracted in commercial channels. The commission shall designate the quarters (three (3) month periods) for the purpose of collection of this tax.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c47s22-4716ol12">
       The tax shall be levied and assessed to the seller at the time of delivery for sale and shall be deducted by the first purchaser from the price paid to the seller at the time of sale, or in case of a lienholder who may possess the oilseed under his lien, the tax shall be deducted by the lienholder from the proceeds of the claim secured by the lien at the time the oilseed is pledged or mortgaged. The tax shall be deducted as provided in this section whether the oilseed is stored in this state or elsewhere. The commission may, however, permit any federal corporation, such as the commodity credit corporation, to waive its responsibility for the collection of the tax, provided the amount of the tax is one dollar ($1.00) or less.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c47s22-4716ol13">
       The tax constitutes a lien prior to all other liens and encumbrances upon the oilseed, except liens which are declared prior by operation of a statute of this state.

      <li id="t22c47s22-4716ol14">
       Any person or firm who pays taxes to the commission at a date later than that prescribed in this section may be subject to assessment of a late payment penalty as set forth by rule of the commission. The penalty shall not exceed the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum on the amount due. In addition to the penalty, the commission may recover all costs and fees, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred in collecting the tax and penalty provided for in this section.

       Exclusivity of State Regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the legislature has authorized both the counties and the state to regulate confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and because these authorities overlap, it is unlikely that a court would conclude the state has completely occupied the field of CAFO regulation or that state law provides an exclusive regulatory program that preempts all local regulation.<cite class="OAG">OAG 08-01</cite>.

       The legislature recognizes the importance of protecting state natural resources including surface water and ground water. It is the intent of the legislature to protect the quality of these natural resources while maintaining an ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially responsible beef cattle industry in the state. The beef cattle industry produces manure and process wastewater which, when properly used, supplies valuable nutrients and organic matter to soils and is protective of the environment, but may, when improperly stored and managed, create adverse impacts on natural resources, including waters of the state. This chapter is intended to ensure that manure and process wastewater associated with beef cattle operations are handled in a manner which protects the natural resources of the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c49s22-4902ol12">
       Successful implementation of this chapter is dependent upon the department receiving adequate funding from the legislature. Moreover, the legislature recognizes that it is important for the state to obtain a delegated national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) program from the United States environmental protection agency under the clean water act. The department’s authority to enforce this chapter should be consistent and coordinated with the department of environmental quality’s authorities pursuant to title 39, Idaho Code, to protect state ground and surface waters, and to obtain approval from the United States environmental protection agency to implement and administer an Idaho NPDES program governing the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States as defined in the federal clean water act.

    The 2016 amendment, by ch. 129, added the last sentence in subsection (1); and rewrote subsections (2) and (3), which formerly read: “(2) In order to carry out its duties under this chapter, the department shall be the responsible state department to prevent any ground water contamination from beef cattle animal feeding operations as provided under section 39-120, Idaho Code. (3) The director shall have the authority to exercise any other authorities delegated by the director of the department of environmental quality regarding the protection of ground water, surface water and other natural resources associated with confined animal feeding operations, and this shall be the authority for the director of the department of environmental quality to so delegate.” Compiler’s Notes.

       Local Regulation.

      <p>
       Where a dairymen’s association and a cattle association filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of Gooding County, Idaho, Ordinance No. 90, which regulated water quality at confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), the supreme court held that Ordinance 90 did not violate Idaho Const., Art. XII, § 2. While<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.42.html#t42c01s42-101" target="_blank">§ 42-101 </a></cite>provided that control over the appropriation of water was vested in the state, regulation of water quality by local government was not preempted under subsections (1) and (3) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c01s67-6529D" target="_blank">§ 67-6529D</a></cite>; because of Idaho’s diverse geographical setting, water regulation at CAFOs does not call for a uniform regulatory scheme.

The compliance conference shall provide an opportunity for the recipient of a notice of noncompliance to explain the circumstances of the alleged violation and, where appropriate, to present a proposal for remedying damage caused by the alleged violation and assuring future compliance. If the recipient and the director agree on a plan to remedy damage caused by the alleged noncompliance and to assure future compliance, they may enter into a compliance order formalizing their agreement. The compliance order may include a schedule to correct deficiencies and a provision providing for payment of any agreed civil penalty.

       Civil enforcement. The director may initiate a civil enforcement action through the attorney general. Civil enforcement actions shall be commenced and prosecuted in the district court in and for the county in which the alleged violation occurred, and may be brought against any person who is alleged to have violated any provision of this act or any permit or order which has become effective pursuant to this act. Such action may be brought to compel compliance with any provision of this act or with any permit or order promulgated hereunder and for any relief or remedies authorized in this act.

    (4) Civil penalty. Any person determined in a civil enforcement action to have violated any provision of this act or any permit or order promulgated pursuant to this act shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per violation or one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day of a continuing violation. The method of recovery of said penalty shall be by a civil enforcement action in the district court in and for the county where the violation occurred. Moneys collected for violations of this section or rules promulgated thereunder shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the state school building fund. The imposition or computation of monetary penalties shall take into account the seriousness of the violation, good faith efforts to comply with the law, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, the economic benefit, if any, of the violation and such other matters as justice requires.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every person applying for a license shall execute and file with the department a good and sufficient bond issued by an insurer authorized to transact such insurance in this state. The bond shall be in favor of the seed indemnity fund to secure the faithful performance of the applicant’s obligations under this chapter, and of such additional unpaid obligations assumed under agreements with producers of seed crops transferred to or deposited with the applicant. Said bond shall be in such form and amount, shall have such surety or sureties, and shall contain such terms and conditions as the department may prescribe to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Whenever the department determines that a previously approved bond is insufficient, it may require an additional bond or bonds conforming with the requirements of this chapter. Unless the additional bond is given within the time fixed by a written demand therefor, the license may be suspended or revoked.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the discretion of the director, any person required to submit a bond to the department may give to the department an irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit payable to the seed indemnity fund in lieu of the bond required herein. A certificate of deposit shall be submitted with an audited or reviewed financial statement prepared in accordance with the rules of the department by an independent Idaho certified public accountant or Idaho licensed public accountant. The principal amount of the letter of credit or certificate of deposit shall be the same as that required for a surety bond pursuant to this chapter. The letter of credit or certificate of deposit shall remain on file with the department until it is released, canceled or discharged by the director or until the director is notified ninety (90) days in advance, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, that the letter of credit or certificate of deposit is renewed, canceled or amended. Failure to notify the director may result in the suspension or revocation of the seed buyer license. The provisions of this chapter that apply to a bond apply to each letter of credit or certificate of deposit given in lieu of such bond. Under the provisions of this chapter, an irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit shall not be accepted unless it is issued by a national bank or federal thrift institution in Idaho or by a state-chartered bank or thrift institution authorized to conduct business in Idaho and insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a seed buyer is also licensed pursuant to either chapter 2 or 5, title 69, Idaho Code, that seed buyer may obtain a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit as surety for both chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, and chapter 2 or 5, title 69, Idaho Code. The bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall be made out in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and the seed indemnity fund. In the event a seed buyer fails as defined in section 22-5102(6), Idaho Code, and a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and seed indemnity fund, the proceeds of the bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit will be allocated based on the dollar amount of the verified claims approved pursuant to chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, and chapter 2, title 69, Idaho Code.

The director may bring suit on behalf of the seed indemnity fund and in the name of any claimant paid from the fund in district court of Ada county to recover from the seed buyer and its surety the amount of the payment made from the seed indemnity fund, together with costs and attorney’s fees incurred in maintaining the suit. In the event the department initiates an action against a seed buyer or surety, the department’s claim is deemed to accrue and relate back to the time that each producer who received a seed indemnity fund payment incurred a loss with the seed buyer. Any recovery for reimbursement of the fund shall bear interest at the statutory rate from the date of failure.

      The legislative intent of this act is to authorize the Idaho state department of agriculture to administer and enforce this act, the produce safety rule, not to exceed the standards required by federal law. The Idaho state department of agriculture shall create a program capable of fulfilling a thorough and competent preventive food safety system through a collaborative and cooperative effort that will demonstrate movement toward the goal of improved produce safety. Such program shall ensure that fresh fruit and vegetables meet standards to provide the safest food to consumers and improve access to wholesome nutritious fresh produce across the state, the nation and the world.
