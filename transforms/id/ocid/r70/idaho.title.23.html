     <p>
      This act is passed in the exercise of the police power of the state. It is not designed to abridge the personal privilege of a responsible adult to consume alcoholic liquor as a beverage, except in cases of the abuse of that privilege to the detriment of others. The public interest requires that traffic in alcoholic liquor be regulated and controlled by the state, through the medium of a state liquor division vested with exclusive authority to import and sell such liquor, with certain exceptions, which are subject to its regulation.

        This section was amended by two 1980 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
    The 1980 amendment by ch. 68, in the first sentence of subsection (a), deleted the word “a” preceding “liquor” and substituted “stores” for “store.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1980 amendment by ch. 301, in the first sentence of subsection (a) made the same changes as were made by ch. 68; added the words “or distributing station” where they appear in the second and third sentences of subsection (a) and in subsection (b); in the second sentence of subsection (a), inserted the language “within a city . . . station” and the language following “proposed liquor store;” in the third sentence of subsection (a) inserted the language “, notice of the right . . . will be held,”; and substituted the present fourth sentence of subsection (a) for one which read; “Within one (1) week after the last legal notice has been published, the dispensary shall hold a public hearing to give eligible voters who live in precincts located within a one thousand (1000) feet radius of the proposed site a chance to register a protest.”

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person who is eighteen (18) years of age or older who shall sell, give, or furnish, or cause to be sold, given, or furnished, alcohol beverage, including any distilled spirits, beer or wine, to a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof may be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed one (1) year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. A second or subsequent violation of this section by the same defendant shall constitute a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof the defendant shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than two thousand dollars ($2,000) per violation, or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed one (1) year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19-4705, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to such fines shall be deposited in the substance abuse treatment fund, as created in section 23-408, Idaho Code. Upon conviction of any person for a violation of the provisions of this section, the court shall notify the director of the Idaho state police. The director shall review the circumstances of the conviction, and if the dispensing took place at a licensed establishment or other retailer or distributor, the director may take administrative action he considers appropriate against the licensee or business including suspension of the license for not to exceed six (6) months, a fine, or both such suspension and fine.

    The 1999 amendments, by ch. 59, § 3, and ch. 397, § 1, in the catchline, substituted “Dispensing” for “Disposal”; in the first sentence, substituted “alcohol beverage, including any distilled spirits, beer or wine”, for “alcoholic or intoxicating liquor”; deleted “, except for medicinal purposes,” preceding “shall be guilty of a misdemeanor”; and added the present last two sentences.
       </p>

        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 141, in the third sentence, substituted “substance abuse” for “alcoholism” and “section 23-408” for “section 23-404.”

       Punishment of persons 18 to 21 years of age for possession of alcohol, including suspension of driver’s license, is not violative of either equal protection or due process rights, since the state has a legitimate interest in the prevention of underage drinking; suspension of a driver’s license is a form of deterrence, and the fact that the suspension is applicable to adults between eighteen and twenty-one does not render it unconstitutional, since they are still subject to restrictions on drinking.

    Where there was sufficient evidence in the record to sustain a conviction of the defendant of the offense of illegal possession of liquor without admission of the exhibit, the officers testifying they saw unstamped liquor in defendant’s possession, such testimony was sufficient to sustain the conviction of the crime and it was error to grant the motion to instruct the jury to acquit the defendant.

       <p>
        The sale of alcoholic beverages in Idaho by a licensed vendor of such beverages to an actually, apparently and obviously intoxicated person known to be a minor can be a contributing actual and proximate cause of damage resulting to a third person from the subsequent negligent operation of an automobile by such intoxicated minor, thereby giving rise to a cause of action against such vendor; and the question of whether such vendor could reasonably have foreseen or anticipated that such sale to such minor might result in injury to others and whether such vendor’s conduct in so acting fell below that of a person of ordinary prudence acting under the same circumstances and conditions is one of fact to be resolved by the jury.

       <p>
        The question of whether a nuisance exists may be answered in the affirmative by evidence of one sale, or by evidence of no sale, where the circumstances are such that a reasonable man must conclude that an unlawful business is being carried on. State ex rel. Good v. Boyle, 67 Idaho 512, 186 P.2d 859 (1947); State ex rel. Good v. Holmes, 67 Idaho 525, 186 P.2d 867 (1947); State ex rel. Good v.

    The test, in order to constitute a nuisance under this section, is not the number of sales made nor the length of time liquor is kept on the premises, but whether the place is maintained for the keeping and sale of liquor within the meaning of the statute. State ex rel. Good v. Boyle, 67 Idaho 512, 186 P.2d 859 (1947); State ex rel. Good v. Holmes, 67 Idaho 525, 186 P.2d 867 (1947); State ex rel. Good v. Evans, 67 Idaho 526, 186 P.2d 868 (1947); State ex rel. Good v. Hansen, 67 Idaho 528, 186 P.2d 869 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suit to abate liquor nuisance, an internal revenue retail liquor dealer special tax stamp or receipt was not admissible in evidence, since it could not be ascertained from the face of the document that it was actually issued to the defendant. State ex rel. Good v. Boyle, 67 Idaho 512, 186 P.2d 859 (1947).

     <p>
      The director of the Idaho state police and any prosecuting attorney of any county, for the purposes contemplated by this act, have power to issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, certify to official acts, take depositions within and without the state of Idaho, as now provided by law, compel the production of pertinent books, payrolls, accounts, papers, records, documents and testimony. If a person in attendance before such director or prosecuting attorney refuses, without reasonable cause, to be examined or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or to produce a book or paper or other evidence when ordered so to do by the director or prosecuting attorney, said director or prosecuting attorney may apply to the judge of the district court of the county where such person is in attendance, upon affidavit for an order returnable not less than two (2) or more than five (5) days, directing such person to show cause before such judge, or any other judge of such district, why he should not be punished for contempt; upon the hearing of such order, if the judge shall determine that such person has refused, without reasonable cause or legal excuse, to be examined or to answer a legal or pertinent question, or to produce a book or paper which he was ordered to bring or produce, he may forthwith punish the offender as for contempt of court.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any books or papers or documents in any investigation or inquiry by or upon any hearing before any officer so authorized upon the ground that the testimony or evidence, books, papers or documents required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture; but no person shall be prosecuted, punished or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any act, transaction, matter or thing concerning which he shall, under oath, have, by order of the said officer, testified to or produced documentary evidence of; provided, however, that no person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury testified by him.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subpoenas shall be served and witness fees and mileage paid as allowed in civil cases in the district courts of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors and investigators employed by the Idaho state police for the enforcement of this act shall have all the authority given by statute to peace officers of the state of Idaho, including authority to serve and execute warrants of arrest and warrants of search and seizure.

        A cause of action did lie against a licensed vendor of spirits for negligently continuing to serve alcoholic beverages to an obviously intoxicated adult which arose prior to the enacting of this section but shall apply prospectively, that is, only to this case and other causes of action arising subsequent to September 20, 1985. Bergman v. Henry, 115 Idaho 259, 766 P.2d 729 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order granting partial summary judgment holding that comparative negligence did not apply to a claim brought under this section was reversed where the Dram Shop Act addressed proximate cause, not duty or breach of duty. Dep’t of Labor v. Sunset Marts, Inc., 140 Idaho 207, 91 P.3d 1111 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In claim by parents of minor passenger injured in single vehicle accident against store that sold alcohol to obviously intoxicated driver, parents’ argument that their son was not legally a “person” was rejected. Paragraph (4)(b) by its terms applies to all persons who are passengers, regardless of their ages. McLean v. Maverik Country Stores, Inc., 142 Idaho 810, 135 P.3d 756 (2006).

        The disparate treatment of intoxicated persons under this provision is not unconstitutional in that it is rationally related to the legitimate governmental purposes of limiting dram shop and social host liability and discouraging irresponsible consumption of alcohol. Coghlan v. Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, 133 Idaho 388, 987 P.2d 300 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The city ordinance which provided that no license issued by the city to sell beer or wine should be renewed if the applicant had been convicted of driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, drugs or any other intoxicating substances within five (5) years prior to the date of the making of the application for license was constitutional, because if a retail seller of alcohol has been unable or unwilling to recognize when he himself was too intoxicated to be driving a motor vehicle, the city could reasonably conclude that he would not use sufficient care to refrain from selling beer and wine to intoxicated customers. Sanchez v. City of Caldwell, 135 Idaho 465, 20 P.3d 1 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (4)(b) does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the United States or Idaho Constitutions, because there are conceivable facts that would support the legislative classification under the rational basis test. McLean v. Maverik Country Stores, Inc., 142 Idaho 810, 135 P.3d 756 (2006).

       <p>
        Although the legislature has generally espoused the comparative negligence approach for negligence actions, because it is not precluded from limiting or rejecting the application of that approach in actions arising out of particular circumstances its enactment of a statutory bar to an action by an intoxicated person against the provider of alcohol was within its constitutional powers. Coghlan v. Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, 133 Idaho 388, 987 P.2d 300 (1999).

       <p>
        Since the claimed cause of action, alcohol provider liability for injury suffered by the intoxicated person to whom the alcohol was provided, did not exist at common law at the time the state constitution was adopted, the right to have a jury determine the merits of such a case is not protected by the constitution. Coghlan v. Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, 133 Idaho 388, 987 P.2d 300 (1999).

        It is clear from the language used in this section that the convention center exception to the restrictions to liquor licenses mandated by this section makes the absence of another qualifying convention center within the same city a condition precedent to its operation and effect.

        This section bars the issuance of a special convention center retail alcoholic beverage license if there exists within the city a facility meeting the statutory criteria of a convention center that has already been issued a retail license, even though that center holds a regular license rather than a special one.

        The department of law enforcement [now state police] did not act beyond its jurisdiction in revoking a retail alcoholic beverage license that had been improperly issued to a second convention center under this section even though the convention center itself had committed no unlawful acts or omissions.

       <p>
        While selective enforcement is a necessary prerequisite to a prima facie case of discriminatory enforcement, it is in and of itself insufficient; to prevail on such a claim, it is clear that the plaintiff also must show a deliberate and intentional plan of discrimination based upon some unjustifiable or arbitrary classification. Thus, where there had been neither a showing nor allegation of discriminatory intent by the department of law enforcement [now state police] in enforcing the liquor license law against the plaintiff convention center, the plaintiff’s claim of discriminatory enforcement had to fail.

     <p>
      Upon receipt of an application for a license under this act, accompanied by the necessary license fee, the director, within ninety (90) days thereafter, shall cause to be made a thorough investigation of all matters pertaining thereto.

If issued to a partnership, the names of the persons constituting such partnership shall be set forth in the application. If issued to a corporation or association, the names of the principal officers and the governing board shall be set forth in the application. Such license shall be signed by the licensee and prominently displayed in the place of business at all times.

All licenses shall expire at 1:00 o’clock a.m. on the first day of the renewal month which shall be determined by the director by administrative rule and shall be subject to annual renewal upon proper application. The director will determine the renewal month by county based on the number of current licenses within each county, distributing renewals throughout the licensing year. The director may adjust the renewal month to accommodate population increases. Each licensee will be issued a temporary license to operate until their renewal month has been determined. Thereafter, renewals will occur annually on their renewal month. Renewal applications for liquor by the drink licenses accompanied by the required fee must be filed with the director on or before the first day of the designated renewal month. Any licensee holding a valid license who fails to file an application for renewal of his current license on or before the first day of the designated renewal month shall have a grace period of an additional thirty-one (31) days in which to file an application for renewal of the license. The licensee shall not be permitted to sell and dispense liquor by the drink at retail during the thirty-one (31) day extended time period unless and until the license is renewed. In any city of less than sixteen thousand (16,000) population, as established in the last preceding census or any subsequent special census conducted by the United States bureau of the census, no person shall be granted more than one (1) license in any city for any one (1) year; and no partnership, association or corporation in such city of less than sixteen thousand (16,000) population holding a license under the provisions of this chapter shall have as a member, officer or stockholder any person who has any financial interest of any kind in, or is a member of, another partnership or association or an officer of another corporation holding a license in the same city for the same year; provided that this section shall not prevent any person, firm or corporation, owning two (2) or more buildings on connected property in a city from making application for and receiving licenses permitting the sale of liquor by the drink in such building.

       <p>
        The 1991 amendment by ch. 28, § 1 in subsection (1) in the second and third sentences added “in the application” following “be set forth”; in subsection (2) at the end of the second sentence substituted “issue a license to the transferee” for “note his approval thereof upon such license”; added the present subsection (3) and renumbered former subsection (3) as present subsection (4) and in the last sentence of such subsection (4) substituted “subsection (5)” for “subsection (4)” preceding “(a), (b)”; renumbered former subsections (4) and (5) as present subsections (5) and (6) and in present subsection (6) deleted “section 23-908” following “transfers as outlined in”, substituted “(5)” for “(4)” preceding “(a), (b),” and substituted “of this section” for “, Idaho Code”; and deleted a former subsection (6) which read, “The controlling interest in the stock ownership of a corporate licensee shall not be, directly or indirectly, sold, transferred, or hypothecated unless the licensee be a corporation, the stock of which is listed on a stock exchange in Idaho, or in the city of New York, state of New York, or which is required by law to file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission. Provided, however, that in the event of the transfer of more than twenty-five per cent (25%) of the authorized and issued stock of the corporation, it shall create a rebuttable presumption that such transfer constituted a transfer of the controlling interest of such corporation.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1991 amendment by ch. 283, § 1, in subsection (1) in the first sentence added “the provisions of” following “Every license issued under”, substituted “chapter” for “act” preceding “shall set”; in the fifth sentence substituted “chapter” for “act” following “provisions of this”; in the eighth sentence added all the clause at the beginning of the sentence preceding “no person shall”, added “in such city of less than sixteen thousand (16,000) population” following “no partnership, association or corporation”, added “the provisions of” following “holding a license under” and substituted “chapter” for “act” preceding “shall have as a member”; and in subsection (3) changed “subsections” to “subsection” following “except as provided by.”

        Persons may freely contract for the transfer of liquor licenses, subject, of course, to the approval of the department of law enforcement [now state police], and such contracts may be specifically enforced as the conveyance of a unique property; thus by carefully drawn and executed agreements, a lessor may ensure that a liquor license will not be transferred away from the leased premises, regardless of whether the liquor license was originally issued in the lessor’s name.

       <p>
        Liquor license was simply the grant or permission under governmental authority to the licensee to engage in the business of selling liquor, and requiring the holder to pay a transfer fee did not amount to a governmental taking without just compensation.

      All liquor sold by any licensee shall be purchased from the division through its regular retail stores and distributing stations at the posted price thereof. The division is hereby authorized and directed to make such sales pursuant to section 23-309, Idaho Code, upon a special permit issued to such licensee in such form as shall be prescribed by the director of the division.

      It shall be unlawful for any licensee to sell, or keep for sale, or have on his premises for any purpose whatsoever, any liquor except that purchased as herein authorized and provided, and any licensee found in possession of, selling or keeping for sale any liquor not purchased as herein authorized shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five (5) years, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Any license issued to such person shall be immediately and permanently revoked. The amount of liquor to be sold to licensees hereunder in any city or village shall be determined by the director or other executive officer of the division, but such sales shall be regulated so as to maintain adequate stocks of merchandise for sale to persons other than said licensees.

        Where there was nothing in the record to show that the defendant’s physical appearance, standing alone, could sustain a conclusion that he was of age, but where there was testimony by both the defendant and other witnesses that he purchased beer, it was permissible for the jury to take into account the common knowledge of the legal age for the purchase and consumption of alcohol.

     <p>
      Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit the issuance of a license to the owner, operator, or lessee of a premises previously licensed as a golf course under the provisions of section 23-903, Idaho Code, following termination of the golf course use and conversion of the premises to another use or uses, provided that the golf course was licensed as a golf course under the provisions of section 23-903, Idaho Code, for a minimum of twenty (20) years prior to such termination. The provisions of section 23-910, Idaho Code, shall be applicable to licenses issued pursuant to this section.

Licenses issued under the provisions of this section are not transferable away from the premises. Upon termination of the golf course use, no part of the premises shall be eligible for the issuance of an additional license pursuant to section 23-955, Idaho Code, due to a split in ownership which occurs after such termination. The eligibility to obtain a license pursuant to this section following termination of the golf course use shall, in the event of a later split in ownership of the premises, be allocated to one (1) of the parcels resulting from such split, either by contract between the parties to the split or by grant or reservation in the deed of conveyance. In the event the contract between the parties or the deed of conveyance fails to specify which parcel retains eligibility under this section, eligibility shall be deemed to be retained by the parcel upon which is, or was, located the greater share of physical improvements at or within which alcohol was served prior to the split in ownership. Upon any further split of the parcel retaining eligibility to obtain a license pursuant to this section, the same restrictions shall apply to the new split in ownership and any future splits of the parcel retaining such eligibility, such that there shall never be more than one (1) license issued pursuant to this section for the land constituting the original golf course premises. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the issuance of a license to the owner, operator or lessee of any split-off parcel to the extent such parcel qualifies for a license under any other provision of this chapter.

       Where charge made by the commissioner [now director] did not show a violation of any of the provisions of the law regulating the business of the brewer, it did not state any grounds for the contemplated revocation or suspension of such brewery license; therefore a court of equity would interfere by injunction to protect the litigant where it was made to appear that irreparable injury would result from further pursuit of the administrative process and the district court, being granted jurisdiction in all cases by the constitution both in law and in equity, had jurisdiction of the suit by the brewery seeking to enjoin the commissioner (now director) from suspending or revoking its license on the grounds of an advertising plan it had been using.

       Before any brewer shall manufacture or any dealer or wholesaler import or sell beer within the state of Idaho, such brewer shall apply to the director for a license. The application form shall be prescribed and furnished by the director and require that the applicant show that such brewer possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications of a licensee. To determine qualification for a license, the director shall cause an investigation that shall include a fingerprint-based criminal history check of the Idaho central criminal history database and the federal bureau of investigation criminal history database. Each person listed as an applicant on an initial application shall submit a full set of fingerprints and the fee to cover the cost of the criminal history background check with the application. The application shall also be accompanied by the required licensee fee; provided, that where the applicant is or will be within more than one (1) of the foregoing classifications, the applicant shall apply for each classification but shall pay only one (1) license fee, which shall be for the classification requiring the highest fee. If the director is satisfied that the applicant possesses the qualifications and none of the disqualifications for the license, the director shall issue a license for each classification applied for, subject to the restrictions and upon the conditions in this act specified, which license or licenses shall be at all times prominently displayed in the place of business of the licensee.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c10s23-1003ol1b">
       Each wholesaler shall, in addition to the application, file with the director a notice in writing signed by the dealer or brewer and the wholesaler stating the geographic territory within which the wholesaler will distribute beer to retailers. The territory will be agreed upon between the dealer or brewer and the wholesaler and may not be changed or modified without the consent of both the dealer or brewer and the wholesaler. Provided however, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit a brewer or dealer from permitting more than one (1) distributor for the same geographic territory.

       In the event that a wholesaler sells beer to a retailer who is located outside the geographical territory designated by that wholesaler on the notice provided for in subsection (b) of this section, the dealer or wholesaler who has designated the geographical territory in which the sale occurred may apply to a district court of this state for the issuance of an injunction enjoining sales of beer by the wholesaler outside of its designated geographical territory. The procedure for issuance of an injunction pursuant to this act shall be subject to the Idaho rules of civil procedure. Upon proof to the court that a wholesaler has made a sale of beer outside of its designated geographical territory, the court shall issue an injunction directed to the wholesaler prohibiting sales of beer outside of its designated geographical territory.

      § 23-1006. Records and returns of licensees — Investigations and examinations.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every licensed dealer, brewer and wholesaler shall have, and notify the director of, a place of business within the state of Idaho where such licensee will and shall keep a record of his or its imports into, and sales of beer within, the state, including the date, quantity, from whom purchased for import, the carrier or other person or means by whom or which transported for import, and the name and address of the vendee, and shall so keep such record of each such sale or import for a period of four (4) years thereafter. Such licensee shall, on or before the 15th day of each month, make a return to the director of the amount of beer sold in, and imported by him into, the state of Idaho for the preceding month, which shall be upon forms furnished by the director. The director may require such additional information to be included in such returns as shall assist him in determining whether or not such licensee is complying with, or violating, this act and whether or not all taxes and license fees provided for by this act are being fully paid. The director shall have the right at any time to make an examination of each dealer’s, brewer’s and wholesaler’s books, records and premises, make an inventory and otherwise check the accuracy of such returns, and investigate for any violation of this act, and file, and retain in his office for not less than two (2) years, a report thereof. An application for, and acceptance of a license by, a dealer, brewer, wholesaler or retailer shall constitute consent to, and be authority for, entry by the director, or his authorized agents, upon any premises related to the licensee’s business, or wherein are, or should be, kept, any of the licensee’s books, records, supplies or other property related to said business, and to make the inventory, check and investigations aforesaid with relation to said licensee or any other licensee.

        Restriction of licenses for sale of beer in residential district of town by county commissioners to two did not constitute a prohibition of sale of beer, but constituted a reasonable restriction, which did not conflict with statutory law on sale of beer. Gartland v. Talbott, 72 Idaho 125, 237 P.2d 1067 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restriction on sale of liquor by license is a proper exercise of police power by county, since no one has an inherent constitutional right to license for sale of liquor. Gartland v. Talbott, 72 Idaho 125, 237 P.2d 1067 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        A county may not prohibit sale of liquor by license, if state law provides for sale of liquor by license, but the county may prescribe certain restrictions on sale of liquor, if those restrictions do not conflict with state act regulating sale of liquor by license. Gartland v. Talbott, 72 Idaho 125, 237 P.2d 1067 (1951).

       <p>
        Unlike the rather broad “local option” afforded local government in the case of liquor, the right to sell beer may not be denied by local government arbitrarily, and, in fact, local government may only place “reasonable” restrictions on the sale of beer.

        Where the record indicated that a landowner possessed all the qualifications, and none of the disqualifications, set by statute and ordinance as prerequisites for the issuance of a license to operate a beer tavern, the city council had no discretion to deny him a license; its duty to issue the license was merely ministerial.

Thereafter, renewals will occur annually on their renewal month. Renewal applications for licenses accompanied by the required fee must be filed with the director on or before the first day of the designated renewal month. Any licensee holding a valid license who fails to file an application for renewal of the current license on or before the first day of the designated renewal month shall have a grace period of an additional thirty-one (31) days in which to file an application for renewal of the license. The licensee shall not be permitted to sell beer at retail during the thirty-one (31) day extended time period unless and until the license is renewed.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 1987 amendment, by ch. 110, in subsection (2) substituted “subsections” for “subsection” following “as provided in”, deleted “above” following “in subsections (1)”, added “and (4) herein” preceding “shall have a” and added a subsection (4) identical to that added by chapter 351.

       <p>
        The 1987 amendment, by ch. 351, in subsection (1) substituted “six (6)” for “seven (7)” following “o’clock A.M. and” and added a subsection (4) identical to that added by chapter 110.

       <p>
        A city ordinance banning all beer sales on Sunday was valid and did not conflict with this section; the manifest intention of the 1978 amendment to this section was to permit a purchaser of beer for on-premises consumption a reasonable amount of time to finish his beer after closing and the amendment had nothing to do with the right of cities to regulate the Sunday sale of packaged beer for off-premises consumption.

       <p>
        County regulation providing that no beer shall be sold from Saturday midnight to 7:00 a.m. of following Monday, and on certain designated holidays, which regulation extended hours when beer should not be sold as provided by statute, is not in conflict with the general law, and is a valid regulation in territory embraced in county, exclusive of municipalities, but regulation is of no effect within limits of incorporated municipalities located in the county. Clyde Hess Distrib. Co. v. Bonneville County, 69 Idaho 505, 210 P.2d 798 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature by providing that sale of beer was prohibited between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. did not intend to occupy whole field of hours for sale of beer, hence regulation by county as to hours of sale is not necessarily inconsistent with the general law. Clyde Hess Distrib. Co. v. Bonneville County, 69 Idaho 505, 210 P.2d 798 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of county commissioner prohibiting sale of beer from Saturday midnight to 7:00 a.m. on following Monday, and also prohibiting sale of beer on certain designated holidays, is not void on the ground that it is inconsistent with the general law insofar as it extended hours during which beer may not be sold. Clyde Hess Distrib. Co. v. Bonneville County, 69 Idaho 505, 210 P.2d 798 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restrictions imposed by the county on the sale of beer which merely add limitations to statutory provisions, and which are not unreasonable or discriminatory, and reasonably tend to promote some object within the police power of county, and are not so restrictive as to operate prohibitively, will be upheld as being within the police power and not in conflict with the general law. Taggart v. Latah County, 78 Idaho 99, 298 P.2d 979 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        County ordinance, which prohibited licensed beer establishments located in unincorporated territory in the county from selling beer between the hours of midnight and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays was valid, though this section prohibited sales on weekdays between 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., since the ordinance was reasonable and did not arbitrarily interfere with the operation of the establishments involved so as to be prohibitive. Taggart v. Latah County, 78 Idaho 99, 298 P.2d 979 (1956).

        A county may not arbitrarily prohibit sale of beer to applicant for license to sell beer, as it is duty of the county to grant a license to a duly qualified applicant upon such terms and conditions as the county may require. Barth v. De Coursey, 69 Idaho 469, 207 P.2d 1165 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Resolution of Canyon County that it will not issue a license to sell beer outside corporate limits of cities and villages in the county amounts to prohibition of licenses for the balance of the county and is inconsistent with, and contrary to, the state law legalizing sale of beer. Barth v. De Coursey, 69 Idaho 469, 207 P.2d 1165 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where county commissioners refused to grant a qualified applicant a license to sell beer solely on the ground that resolution prohibited sale of beer outside corporate limits of cities and towns, the resolution was unreasonable, prohibitory, and contrary to the state law, so court will issue writ of mandate to compel the commission to issue the license.

        Where statutes authorize counties and municipalities to regulate place of business where beer is sold, authorize counties to issue licenses upon such terms as it may require, provide for issuance of municipal licenses to retailers after they have first obtained a county license, and provide that both county and municipality may levy and collect license fees, the legislature by virtue of such statutes has not gone beyond its recognized power and has not attempted to empower a county to make police regulations enforceable within a municipality.

       <p>
        County regulation providing that no beer shall be sold from Saturday midnight to 7:00 a.m. of following Monday, and on certain designated holidays, which regulation extended hours when beer should not be sold as provided by statute, is not in conflict with the general law and is a valid regulation in territory embraced in county, exclusive of municipalities; but regulation is of no effect within limits of incorporated municipalities located in the county. Clyde Hess Distrib. Co. v. Bonneville County, 69 Idaho 505, 210 P.2d 798 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature by providing that sale of beer was prohibited between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. did not intend to occupy whole field of hours for sale of beer; hence, regulation by county as to hours of sale is not necessarily inconsistent with the general law.

The procedure for giving notice of such determination and for proceedings to contest determination as provided for in sections 23-1037 through 23-1045, Idaho Code, shall govern insofar as they may be applicable.

        The term “this act” in the first sentence in the first paragraph refers to S.L. 1961, Chapter 299, which is codified as<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t23c10s23-1010" target="_self">§§ 23-1010</a></cite>, 23-1013, 23-1027 to 23-1031, 23-1034 to 23-1037, and 23-1042 to 23-1046.

      Use of said alternative method of payment of taxes imposed on beer as provided for in sections 23-1047 through 23-1055[, Idaho Code], shall not be authorized until the state tax commission shall adopt and promulgate a regulation permitting use of such method.

Upon thirty (30) days written notice mailed to each brewer and dealer licensed in this state and to each brewer and foreign distributor holding a certificate of approval issued by this state the state tax commission may at any time rescind any such regulation and from and after the effective date of rescission only the method for payment of taxes on beer by use of tax stamps as provided for in section 23-1008[, Idaho Code], as amended, shall be used.

    (f) All petitions presented to the county clerk found to apparently contain the necessary number of signatures, after the cursory examination provided for in subsection (e) of this section, shall be filed with the county clerk and become public records of the county not to be returned. The county clerk shall examine each signature purported to be that of a registered elector and compare each such signature with the registration documents available to him. The county clerk shall summarily reject all signatures which are not the signatures of registered electors; and such rejected signatures shall not be counted. Each rejected signature shall be drawn through with ink and initialed by the clerk or his deputy. The county clerk may take not to exceed twenty (20) days after filing of the petition to complete his examination. The county clerk shall certify each signature found to comply with all of the requirements of this act by an appropriate mark following each signature. The county clerk shall total the number of certified signatures and certify the number thereof to the board of county commissioners.

The petition must be perfected within sixty (60) days of the date that the clerk finds the petition defective for lack of certified signatures. If the petition is not perfected within the sixty (60) day period, the clerk shall declare the petition null and void ab initio in its entirety.
       </p>
       <p>
        (h) In the event the county clerk shall certify to the board of county commissioners that a petition contains the required number of signatures of registered, qualified electors, said governing body shall forthwith make an order calling an election to be held, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, within said county in the manner provided by law for holding elections for county officers.

       <p>
        In addition to the other requirements of law, the notice of election shall notify the electors of the issue to be voted upon at said election. The county recorder must furnish the ballots to be used in such election, which ballots must contain the following words:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Sale of table wine at retail, Yes,”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Sale of table wine at retail, No.”

       <p>
        “Sale of dessert wine at retail, No.”
       </p>
       <p>
        and the elector in order to vote must mark an “X” opposite one (1) of the questions in the space provided therefor. Upon a canvass of the votes cast, the county recorder shall certify the result thereof to the director. If a majority of the votes cast are affirmative on the issue or issues presented, licenses shall be issued in said county as in this chapter provided. If a majority of the votes cast are in the negative on the issue or issues presented, then no license shall be issued in said county unless thereafter authorized by a subsequent election in said county which may be called in the manner provided for herein.
       </p>
       <p>
        No resolution or election prohibiting the sale of table wine and/or dessert wine within the boundaries of any county of this state shall have an effective date prior to the end of the then current calendar year if at the time of the adoption thereof there shall be any outstanding valid retail wine licenses in good standing for premises within such county.
    The signer of any petition under this chapter may remove his own name from the petition by crossing out, obliterating, or otherwise defacing his own signature at any time prior to the time when the petition is filed. The signer of any such petition may have his name removed from the petition at any time after the petition has been filed, but prior to the time when an election has been ordered, by presenting or submitting to the county clerk a signed, acknowledged statement that the signer desires to have his name removed from the petition. The statement shall contain sufficient information to clearly identify the signer. The county clerk shall immediately strike the signer’s name from the petition, and adjust the total of certified signatures on the petition accordingly. The statement shall be attached to, and become a part of, the petition.

       Before any person shall manufacture, import into this state, bottle or broker for resale within this state, possess for resale, store and handle wine as a bonded wine warehouse, or distribute or sell wine within the state of Idaho, he shall apply to the director for a license. The application form shall be prescribed and furnished by the director and require that the applicant therein show that he possesses all of the qualifications and none of the disqualifications of a licensee. A person may apply for and receive a license as both a distributor and importer, if otherwise qualified therefor, and shall pay the license fee required pursuant to this chapter for each license. A winery licensed under this chapter shall also be considered as holding, for the purposes of selling a product processed and bottled by or for that winery, a current retail wine license and wine by the drink license for the licensed premises and for use at functions and events identified in section 23-1338, Idaho Code, and a current wine distributor’s and importer’s license, without further application or fee. If the director is satisfied that the applicant possesses the qualifications and none of the disqualifications for such license, he shall issue a license for each classification applied for, subject to the restrictions of and upon the conditions specified in this chapter. The license or licenses issued shall be at all times prominently displayed in the place of business of the licensee. If the director determines that the applicant is not properly qualified, he shall refuse to issue a license and shall forthwith so notify the applicant and shall return to the applicant with such notification, three-fourths (¾) of the license fee remitted with the application. A separate retail wine by the drink license, and wine distributor’s license shall be required for each premises. Provided, however, nothing herein shall prohibit a distributor or retailer or wine by the drink licensee from possessing licenses for more than one (1) premises.

        The 1984 amendment, by ch. 105, § 1, in the first sentence substituted “four (4) years” for “eighteen (18) months”; in the second sentence deleted “(15th)” following “fifteenth”; and in the fourth sentence deleted “and it shall be his duty not less than once in each calendar year,” following “at any time”.

       <p>
        The 2020 amendment, by ch. 10, inserted “bonded wine warehouses” in the section heading; inserted “bonded wine warehouse” in subsection (1); added present subsection (3); redesignated former subsection (3) as present subsection (4); and inserted “bonded wine warehouse’s” near the middle of subsection (4).

      The state tax commission, whenever it deems it necessary to insure compliance with this act, may require any person subject to this act to place with it such security as it may determine. The amount of the necessary security shall be fixed by the state tax commission but, except as provided hereafter, shall not be greater than three (3) times the estimated average monthly amount payable by such persons pursuant to this act. In the case of persons habitually delinquent in their obligations under this act, the amount of the security shall not be greater than five (5) times the estimated average monthly amount payable by such persons pursuant to this act. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the state tax commission at any time, subject to the limitations set forth herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state tax commission may sell the security at public auction or, in the case of security in the form of bearer bonds issued by the United States or the state of Idaho which have a prevailing market price, at a private sale at a price not lower than the prevailing market price if it becomes necessary to make such sale in order to recover any tax, interest or penalties due on any amount required to be collected. Notice of the sale must be given to the person who deposited the security at least ten (10) days before the sale. Such notice may be given personally or by mail addressed to the person at the address furnished to the state tax commission and as it appears in the records of the state tax commission. Upon such sale, any surplus above the amounts due shall be returned to the person who placed the security.

      <li id="t23c13s23-1331ol11">
       The director may suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a retail wine license, wine by the drink license, wine distributor’s license, wine importer’s license, winery license, bonded wine warehouse license, wine direct shipper’s permit or vintner’s license issued pursuant to the terms of this chapter for any violation of or failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or rules and regulations promulgated by the director or the state tax commission pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter. Manufacturing or bottling functions of a winery shall not be subject to suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of a license, except for violations of law directly related to the manufacturing or bottling activities of the winery. Procedures for the suspension, revocation or refusal to grant or renew licenses issued under this chapter shall be in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c13s23-1331ol12">
       When the director determines to suspend such license, the affected licensee may petition the director prior to the effective date of the suspension requesting that a monetary payment be allowed in lieu of the license suspension. If the director determines such payment to be consistent with the purpose of the laws of the state of Idaho and is in the public interest, he shall establish a monetary payment in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000). The licensee may reject the payment amount determined by the director, and instead be subject to the suspension provisions of subsection (1) of this section. Upon payment of the amount established, the director shall cancel the suspension period. The director shall cause any payment to be paid to the treasurer of the state of Idaho for credit to the state’s general account in the state operating fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c13s23-1331ol13">
       The suspension of a license for the sale of liquor or beer shall automatically result in the suspension of any license for the sale of wine held by the same licensee and issued for the same premises or location. Such additional suspension shall be equal in length to and run concurrently with the period of the original suspension.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c13s23-1331ol14">
       When a proceeding to revoke or suspend a license has been or is about to be instituted during the time a renewal application of such license is pending before the director, the director shall renew the license notwithstanding the pending proceedings, but such renewed license may be revoked or suspended without hearing if and when the previous license is, for any reason, revoked or suspended.

     <p>
      Retailers holding valid licenses for the retail sale of liquor by the drink pursuant to chapter 9, title 23, Idaho Code, may sell wine for consumption on or off the licensed premises. Persons holding a valid wine by the drink license may sell wine for consumption on the premises only. Retailers who do not possess a valid license for the retail sale of liquor by the drink, or retailers who do not have a valid wine by the drink license, shall not permit consumption of wine on the licensed premises and may sell the wine only in its original unbroken container. Provided however, that wineries whose business does not include the sale of wine by the drink may provide free single-serving samples of two (2) ounces or less to customers for the purpose of sales promotion upon the winery premises or upon the premises of a retail wine outlet which retails exclusively the wine product of that winery and which is wholly owned and operated thereby. Wine sold for consumption or dispensed on the licensed premises may be sold, consumed or dispensed only during hours that beer can be sold, consumed or dispensed pursuant to the laws of this state. Wine sold by the retailer for consumption off the premises of the retailer may be sold only during the hours that beer may be sold pursuant to the laws of this state.

     <p>
      In the event that wine has been sold or donated to a person or association which desires to dispense or sell such wine and to donate the proceeds from the sale or dispensing thereof for benevolent, charitable or public purposes, the director may issue a permit authorizing such sale or dispensing of wine by such person or association if the director is satisfied that said proceeds, after deducting reasonable expenses incurred in conjunction with the sale or dispensing thereof, will be donated for such benevolent, charitable or public purpose. The director shall prescribe the form of the application for such permit, which application may require disclosure of names of sponsors; donors, quantities and types of wine products donated; the retailer, if any, designated by such person or association to receive, store or dispense donated wine; the dates and hours during which the permit is to be effective, not to exceed three (3) consecutive days; and such other information as the director may require. The director shall collect a twenty dollar ($20.00) fee for the event for which the permit is to be effective. The director may require that the applicant submit a report to the director after the benevolent, charitable or public purpose event showing the disposition of funds from the event. Should the director determine that the applicant or its representatives is violating, or has in the past violated, any law pertaining to the dispensing or sale of wine by a licensed retailer relating to hours of sale, or relating to dispensing wine to underaged persons, or has failed in the past to submit such information as may have been requested by the director, such permit may be summarily suspended by the director, prior to hearing, or may be denied pending a hearing. A licensed retailer may, on behalf of the permittee, receive or store wine to be used at the event, and may dispense such wine to attendees of the benevolent, charitable or public purpose event for which the permit has been issued.
