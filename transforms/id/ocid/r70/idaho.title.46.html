Any commissioned officer who has served as an officer in the national guard of Idaho for a period of twenty (20) years, upon his request, may be advanced one (1) grade, and placed upon the retired list.

     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to encourage compliance with the federal military selective service act and to protect the eligibility of the citizens of this state who are subject to the provisions of the federal statute to receive federal financial assistance for postsecondary education and for employment with the executive branch of the federal government. The federal selective service registration awareness and compliance act requires persons subject to the provisions of the federal military selective service act to be in compliance with the requirements of that federal statute as a condition of eligibility for enrollment at a state-supported institution of postsecondary education, or for state-supported scholarships, programs of financial assistance funded by state revenue including federal funds, gifts or grants accepted by the state, or for employment by the state or any political subdivision.

      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that the military selective service act at 50 U.S.C. sec. 451 [sec. 3801] et seq. requires all male citizens and every other male person residing in the United States, except for lawfully admitted nonimmigrant aliens, upon reaching their eighteenth birthday to register with the United States selective service system. The legislature further finds that federal statutes limit eligibility for federal student financial assistance and eligibility for employment within the executive branch of the federal government to persons who are in compliance with the requirements of the federal military selective service act.

      It is the sense of the legislature that the defense of the country and the general welfare of its people is the joint responsibility of the government of the United States and the several states thereof including the state of Idaho and its cities, villages and counties. In fulfilling this obligation and to promote volunteer organizations and to afford them effectual encouragement, it is necessary for the state of Idaho to provide the national guard with armories for training personnel and housing equipment. The state of Idaho desires to avail itself of the provisions of existing federal statutes, and any statutes that may be enacted hereafter relating to the construction of armories and to provide, in addition to military use, that such armories shall be available for use in event of emergencies or disasters and for community use. To permit cities and villages, cities or villages and counties, and counties to participate with the state of Idaho in the acquisition of armories and sites for armories, and to accomplish the purposes of this act, it is hereby found and declared necessary to authorize cities and villages, cities or villages and counties, and counties to levy taxes, to donate funds and property to the state of Idaho, and to enter into such agreements as may be necessary for the purpose of complying with the statutes of the United States relating to the construction of armories.

        Although<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t46c10s46-1009" target="_self">§ 46-1009 </a></cite>requires the counties to prepare a disaster emergency plan, there is no comparable statute explicitly requiring the cities to participate. Thus, unlike counties, cities are not required to plan for disaster emergencies. Once a disaster emergency occurs within the city’s limits, however, the city government has the responsibility to handle the situation.<cite class="OAG">OAG 89-9</cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plans voluntarily entered into among the various political subdivisions are valid under the Idaho Disaster Preparedness Act of 1975. Because the cities voluntarily ratify the disaster emergency plans, Idaho Const., Art. XII, § 2 is not violated.<cite class="OAG">OAG 89-9</cite>.

        Fire fighting is precisely the type of activity that this section was intended to cover, and, as such, the statute provides immunity to those state agencies involved in disaster relief efforts. This includes the Idaho National Guard. The fact that the statute does not refer to the National Guard specifically is of no consequence; the statute does not name any specific agencies or organizations but lists only broad categories such as the “state,” “any political subdivision thereof,” “other agencies” and their “agents, employees or representatives.” Baca v.

      <li id="t46c10s46-1021ol13">
       “Flood fringe” is that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered by floodwaters during the regulatory flood.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c10s46-1021ol14">
       “Floodplain” is the land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters, or is surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the occurrence of the regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood fringe.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c10s46-1021ol15">
       “Floodplain management” is the analysis and integration of the entire range of measures that can be used to prevent, reduce or mitigate flood damage in a given location, and that can protect and preserve the natural, environmental, historical, and cultural values of the floodplain.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c10s46-1021ol16">
       “Floodproofing” means the modifications of structures, their sites, building contents and water and sanitary facilities, to keep water out or reduce the effects of water entry.

      <li id="t46c10s46-1021ol19">
       “Freeboard” represents a factor of safety usually expressed in terms of a certain amount of feet above a calculated flood level. Freeboard shall compensate for the many unknown factors that contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated.

    (13) “Regulatory flood” is a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Idaho and which may be expected to occur on a particular stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based upon a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the watershed or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In inland areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once in every one hundred (100) years; this means that in any given year there is a one percent (1%) chance that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to the availability of adequate mapping and data to properly identify the floodplains, if any, within its jurisdiction, each local government is encouraged to adopt a floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance which identifies these floodplains and which requires, at a minimum, that any development in a floodplain must be constructed at a flood protection elevation and/or have adequate floodproofing. The local government may regulate all mapped and unmapped floodplains within its jurisdiction. Nothing in this act shall prohibit a local government from adopting more restrictive standards than those contained in this chapter. Floodplain zoning ordinances shall not regulate the operation, cleaning, maintenance or repair of any ditch, canal, lateral, drain, diversion structure or other irrigation or drainage works that is performed or authorized by the owner thereof pursuant to lawful rights and obligations. If not otherwise exempt from approval, a flood control district’s conduct of a “flood fight,” as defined in section 42-3103, Idaho Code, shall not require prior local government approval provided all such approvals are obtained within a reasonable time after the imminent flooding event has ended.

        Subject matter jurisdiction is established if a nexus exists between an offense, either military or nonmilitary, and the state military force, regardless of duty status. Courts-martial convened by the governor or his designated representative have primary jurisdiction of military offenses as defined in article 1(a)(18) of this code. A proper civilian court has primary jurisdiction of a nonmilitary offense when an act or omission violates both this code and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In such a case, a court-martial may be initiated only after the civilian authority has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicitation, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense.
    ARTICLE 3. JURISDICTION TO TRY CERTAIN PERSONNEL
   
    (a) Subject to article 43, a person who is in a status in which the person is subject to this chapter and who committed an offense against this chapter while formerly in a status in which the person was subject to this chapter is not relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter for that offense by reason of a termination of that person’s former status.
   
    (b) Each person discharged from the state military forces who is later charged with having fraudulently obtained his discharge is, subject to article 43, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge and is, after apprehension, subject to this chapter while in the custody of the state military forces for that trial. Upon conviction of that charge, he is subject to trial by court-martial for all offenses under this chapter committed before the fraudulent discharge.
   
    (c) No person who has deserted from the state military forces may be relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter by virtue of a separation from any later period of service.
   
    (d) A member of the state military forces who is subject to this chapter is not, by virtue of the termination of a period of active duty for training or inactive-duty training, relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter for an offense against this chapter committed during such period of active duty or inactive-duty training.

A court-martial so convened has jurisdiction to try the dismissed officer on those charges, and he shall be considered to have waived the right to plead any statute of limitations applicable to any offense with which he is charged. The court-martial may, as part of its sentence, adjudge the affirmance of the dismissal, but if the court-martial acquits the accused or if the sentence adjudged, as finally approved or affirmed, the adjutant general shall substitute for the dismissal ordered by the governor or his designated representative a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue.

The reappointment of such a former officer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy and shall affect the promotion status of other officers only insofar as the governor or his designated representative may direct.

    (a) This code has applicability at all times and in all places subject to the personal jurisdiction as provided in article 2 of this code, or, if not in a duty status, that there is a nexus between the act or omission constituting the offense and the efficient functioning of the state military forces; however, this grant of military jurisdiction shall neither preclude nor limit civilian jurisdiction over an offense, which is limited only by the prohibition of double jeopardy.
   
    (b) Courts-martial and courts of inquiry may be convened and held in units of the state military forces while those units are serving outside the state with the same jurisdiction and powers as to persons subject to this code as if the proceedings were held inside the state, and offenses committed outside the state may be tried and punished either inside or outside the state.

        Whenever complaint is made to any commanding officer that willful damage has been done to the property of any person or that the person’s property has been wrongfully taken by members of the state military forces, that officer may, under such regulations prescribed, convene a board to investigate the complaint. The board shall consist of from one (1) to three (3) commissioned officers and, for the purpose of that investigation, it has power to summon witnesses and examine them upon oath, to receive depositions or other documentary evidence, and to assess the damages sustained against the responsible parties. The assessment of damages made by the board is subject to the approval of the commanding officer, and in the amount approved by that officer shall be charged against the pay of the offenders. The order of the commanding officer directing charges herein authorized is conclusive on any disbursing officer for payment to the injured parties of the damages so assessed and approved.
    (b) If the offenders cannot be ascertained, but the organization or detachment to which they belong is known, charges totaling the amount of damages assessed and approved may be made in such proportion as may be considered just upon the individual members thereof who are shown to have been present at the scene at the time the damages complained of were inflicted, as determined by the approved findings of the board.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Arrest of members of the Idaho military not in federal service by members of the Idaho military while acting in their military capacity is prohibited, except in the following circumstances:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t46c11s46-1103ol11">
       If any member fails or refuses to report to his appointed place of duty, his commanding officer in the rank of major or above is authorized to arrest or cause to be arrested such member and have him brought before the commanding officer at his unit or organization headquarters, whether such headquarters be located within or without the borders of the state. After such an arrest, the commanding officer is authorized to transport, or cause to be transported, such member to his appointed place of duty, whether within or without the borders of the state. Furthermore, if a commander, in the rank of major or above, finds that probable cause exists to believe that a minor offense has been committed by a member of his command, he may cause the member to be arrested and brought before him for the purpose of processing nonjudicial punishment under article 15 of the model state code of military justice as provided in section 46-1102, Idaho Code. If military personnel are not available for the purpose of making the arrest or if the officer ordering the arrest deems it advisable, he may issue a warrant to any sheriff or peace officer authorized to serve warrants of arrest, and such sheriff or peace officer shall serve such warrants of arrest immediately, whenever practicable, and make return thereof to the commanding officer issuing the warrant. Upon receipt of the notification of arrest, the commanding officer shall direct that the arrestee be retrieved and brought before him within a reasonable time. Warrants issued under this subsection shall be the equivalent of a misdemeanor warrant issued by a court of the state of Idaho.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c11s46-1103ol12">
       If any member of the Idaho military has had charges preferred against him under this chapter, and the convening authority to whom the charges have been forwarded has found that probable cause exists that the offense was committed by the accused and that the incarceration of the accused pending court-martial is required because of special circumstances found to exist which warrant such incarceration, then the convening authority is authorized to arrest such member or cause him to be arrested and have him confined pending trial. If military personnel are not available for the purpose of making the arrest, or if the convening authority deems it advisable, he may issue a warrant to any sheriff or peace officer authorized to serve such warrant in the same manner as other warrants of arrest, and said sheriff or peace officer shall effect the arrest and hold the accused in the county jail of the county in which the arrest is effected. Upon receipt of the notification of arrest, in accordance with the provisions of section 46-1102, Idaho Code, the commanding officer may direct that the arrestee be retrieved and brought before him within a reasonable time. Warrants issued under this subsection shall be the equivalent of a felony warrant issued by a court of the state of Idaho.
