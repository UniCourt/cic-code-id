      Consent, or refusal to consent, for the furnishing of health care, treatment or procedures shall be valid in all respects if the person giving or refusing the consent is sufficiently aware of pertinent facts respecting the need for, the nature of, and the significant risks ordinarily attendant upon such a person receiving such care, as to permit the giving or withholding of such consent to be a reasonably informed decision.

        There was insufficient evidence that a dentist failed to adequately inform a patient about a “silver crown” procedure. There was no evidence that a dentist in good standing, under the circumstances, would have apprised the patient of the obscure semantic distinction between a “crown” and an “amalgam buildup” or “amalgam crown.” Peckham v.

        To establish a claim based on the doctrine of informed consent, a patient must prove three basic elements: nondisclosure, causation and injury. In order to show causation, the patient must prove that, if he had been informed of the material risks, he would not have consented to the procedure, and that he had been injured as a result of submitting to the medical procedure.

        A valid consent must be preceded by the physician disclosing those pertinent facts to the patient so that he or she is sufficiently aware of the need for, the nature of, and the significant risks ordinarily involved in the treatment to be provided, in order that the giving or withholding of consent be a reasonably informed decision. The requisite pertinent facts to be disclosed to the patient are those which would be given by a like physician of good standing practicing in the same community. Sherwood v.

        Where a written consent is signed, this section states that the advice and level of informed awareness are only “presumed sufficient.” To challenge this, the plaintiff need not establish by convincing proof that the consent was secured maliciously or by fraud. Rook v. Trout, 113 Idaho 652, 747 P.2d 61 (1987), overruled on other grounds, Sherwood v. Carter, 119 Idaho 246, 805 P.2d 452 (1991).

        The “convincing proof” requirement of this section applies only to challenges regarding whether the patient consented to the furnishing of medical care, not to challenges to the sufficiency of the advice and disclosures and the level of informed awareness. Rook v. Trout, 113 Idaho 652, 747 P.2d 61 (1987), overruled on other grounds, Sherwood v. Carter, 119 Idaho 246, 805 P.2d 452 (1991).

        Where the record totally lacked any allegations that had a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position been adequately informed, that person would not have consented to the surgery, the court properly granted summary judgment to doctors in patient’s malpractice action.

      Obtaining sufficient consent for health care is the duty of the attending health care provider upon whose order or at whose direction the contemplated health care, treatment or procedure is rendered; provided however, a licensed hospital and any employee of a health care provider, acting with the approval of such an attending or other individual health care provider, may perform the ministerial act of documenting such consent by securing the completion and execution of a form or statement in which the giving of consent for such care is documented by or on behalf of the person. In performing such a ministerial act, the hospital or health care provider employee shall not be deemed to have engaged in the practice of medicine or dentistry.

       The legislature recognizes the established common law and the fundamental right of competent persons to control the decisions relating to the rendering of their medical care, including the decision to have life-sustaining procedures withheld or withdrawn. The legislature further finds that modern medical technology has made possible the artificial prolongation of human life beyond natural limits. The legislature further finds that persons are sometimes unable to express their desire to withhold or withdraw such artificial life prolongation procedures which provide nothing medically necessary or beneficial to the person because of the person’s inability to communicate with the health care provider.

       In recognition of the dignity and privacy which persons have a right to expect, the legislature hereby declares that the laws of this state shall recognize the right of a competent person to have his or her wishes for medical treatment and for the withdrawal of artificial life-sustaining procedures carried out even though that person is no longer able to communicate with the health care provider.

       It is the intent of the legislature to establish an effective means for such communication. It is not the intent of the legislature that the procedures described in sections 39-4509 through 39-4515, Idaho Code, are the only effective means of such communication, and nothing in sections 39-4509 through 39-4515, Idaho Code, shall impair or supersede any legal right or legal responsibility which a person may have to effect the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures in any lawful manner, provided that this sentence shall not be construed to authorize any violation of section 39-4514(3), Idaho Code.

The authority given my agent shall supersede any other agreement that I may have made with my health care providers to restrict access to or disclosure of my individually identifiable health information. The authority given my agent has no expiration date and shall expire only in the event that I revoke the authority in writing and deliver it to my health care provider.
    6. SIGNING DOCUMENTS, WAIVERS AND RELEASES. Where necessary to implement the health care decisions that my agent is authorized by this Directive to make, my agent has the power and authority to execute on my behalf all of the following: (a) Documents titled, or purporting to be, a “Refusal to Permit Treatment” and/or a “Leaving Hospital Against Medical Advice”; and (b) Any necessary waiver or release from liability required by a hospital or physician.

        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 273, rewrote subsection (5), which formerly read: “(5) Presumed consent to resuscitation. There is a presumption in favor of consent to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) unless: (a) A completed durable power of attorney for health care or living will for that person is in effect, pursuant to section 39-4510, Idaho Code, in which the person has stated that he or she does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and any terms set forth in the durable power of attorney for health care or living will upon which such statement is conditioned have been met; or (b) The person’s surrogate decision maker has communicated the person’s wishes not to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and any terms on which the wishes not to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation are conditioned have been met; or (c) The person has a physician orders for scope of treatment (POST) form that meets the requirements of section 39-4512A, Idaho Code, stating that the person does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and any terms on which the statement is conditioned have been met and/or has a proper POST identification device pursuant to section 39-4502(15), Idaho Code”.

        Chapters 240 and 270 of S.L. 1978 each purported to enact a new chapter 46 in title 39. Accordingly, chapter 270 was codified as chapter 46 of title 39, while chapter 270 was codified as chapter 48 of title 39 through the use of brackets. Chapter 47 of title 39 was added by S.L. 1978, chapter 155. The redesignation of the sections enacted by S.L. 1978, chapter 240 was made permanent by S.L. 1979, chapter 313.

     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of the legislature of the state of Idaho to authorize and mandate the department of health and welfare to develop and coordinate services for developmentally disabled persons through adult and child development programs and through contracts with rehabilitation facilities. The complexities of developmental disabilities require the services of many state departments as well as those of the community. It is the intent of this chapter that the department of health and welfare will cooperate with recognized agencies, organizations and departments in implementing this chapter. Services should be planned and provided as a part of a continuum. A pattern of facilities, services and eligibility should be established which is sufficiently complete to meet the needs of each developmentally disabled person regardless of age or degree of disability, with consideration of the family.

      Except as provided in section 39-4802, Idaho Code, any child in Idaho of school age may attend grades preschool and kindergarten through twelve (12) of any public, private or parochial school operating in this state if otherwise eligible, provided that upon admission, the parent or guardian shall provide an immunization record to the school authorities regarding the child’s immunity to certain childhood diseases. This record, signed by a physician or his representative or another licensed health care professional, shall verify that such child has received, or is in the process of receiving immunizations as specified by the state board of health and welfare, or can effectively demonstrate, through verification in a form approved by the department of health and welfare, immunity gained through prior contraction of the disease.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immunizations required and the manner and frequency of their administration shall be as prescribed by the state board of health and welfare and shall conform to recognized standard medical practices in the state. The state board of health and welfare, in cooperation with the state board of education and the Idaho school boards association, shall promulgate appropriate rules for the enforcement of the required immunization program and specify reporting requirements of schools, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

        Chapters 240 and 270 of S.L. 1978 each purported to enact a new chapter 46 in title 39. Accordingly, chapter 270 was codified as chapter 46 of title 39, while chapter 270 was codified as chapter 48 of title 39 through the use of brackets. Chapter 47 of title 39 was added by S.L. 1978, chapter 155. The redesignation of the sections enacted by S.L. 1978, chapter 240 was made permanent by S.L. 1979, chapter 313.

      It is the intent of the legislature to provide to all of Idaho residents a quality health care system for a reasonable cost and to prevent the deterioration of such system by the duplication of services or the introduction of new categories of services that are not necessary to their health. It is further the intent of the legislature to promote cooperation among health care providers in health planning activities and to provide access to necessary care for all who require it. It is hereby declared that it is in the public interest of the state, to provide for the relief from penalties of state and federal law, cooperative planning in health care that is likely to benefit the residents of the state.

     <p>
      The policy of the state of Idaho is hereby declared to be a recognition of the increasing number of persons in the state who, having fulfilled the valuable role of homemaker, find themselves displaced because of death or disability of spouse, or divorce or other loss of family income. As a consequence, displaced homemakers have an insufficient income; high rate of unemployment due to age, lack of paid work experience and discrimination; and limited opportunities to collect funds of assistance from social security, unemployment compensation, medicaid or other health insurance benefits, or pension plans of the spouse. This chapter seeks to coordinate efforts by state and local public agencies in cooperation with private agencies and organizations to assist displaced homemakers to continue as productive citizens, even though their role has necessarily changed.

        Two 1980 acts, chapters 121 and 333, purported to create a new chapter 49 in Title 39. Chapter 121 was compiled as Title 39, ch. 49 (§§ 39-4901 to 39-4914) and has since been repealed and replaced by current<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t39c49s39-4901" target="_self">§§ 39-4901 </a></cite>to 39-4904. Chapter 333 was codified by the compiler as chapter 50 of Title 39 through the use of brackets. Sections 39-5002 and 39-5003 were amended and redesignated in 1999 and 1982, respectively, to unique code numbers. The remaining sections enacted by S.L. 1980, ch. 333 were permanently redesignated by S.L. 2005, chapter 25.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c51s39-5100ol11">
       Families are the major providers of support, care, information, training, and other services to their family members with developmental disabilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c51s39-5100ol12">
       Families with individuals who have developmental disabilities may experience extraordinary financial outlays, physical and emotional challenges, and daily stress.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c51s39-5100ol13">
       Failure to provide the necessary services and supports to families with a member with developmental disabilities can result in admission of the individual to institutional care.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c51s39-5100ol14">
       Flexible and coordinated support and assistance to families avoids duplication of services, uses existing resources more efficiently, and prevents gaps in services to families.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c51s39-5100ol15">
       A family’s ability to make informed decisions regarding in-home or out-of-home living arrangements for a member who has a developmental disability is critical to the quality and cost-effective care of their family member.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c51s39-5100ol16">
       Family support and in-home assistance promotes and enhances the family’s capacity to provide care.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c51s39-5100ol17">
       Family support and in-home assistance stimulates the formation of community supports to use public dollars more efficiently.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Therefore, it is in the interest of the state of Idaho to provide in-home assistance for families for supports that enable family members with developmental disabilities to reside at home.

     <p>
      The legislature finds that domestic violence is an issue of growing concern. Research findings show that domestic violence constitutes a significant percentage of homicides, aggravated assaults, and assaults and batteries in the United States. Domestic violence is a disruptive influence on personal and community life and is often interrelated with a number of other family problems and stresses. Refuge for victims of domestic violence is essential to provide protection to victims from further abuse and physical harm. Refuge provides temporary safety and resources to victims who may not have access to such things if they remain in abusive situations.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of the legislature in the adoption of this chapter to provide funding for projects in the several areas of the state for the purpose of aiding victims of domestic violence and other crimes.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is understood that the intention of the provisions of this chapter is not to supersede the authority or responsibilities of agencies of state government responsible for providing services to persons pursuant to the child protective act, crime victims compensation act or adult protective provisions in the Idaho Code.

        Two 1982 acts, chapters 181 and 286, purported to create a new chapter 52 in Title 39. Chapter 181 was compiled as Title 39, chapter 52 (§§ 39-5201 to 39-5213) while chapter 286 was designated by the compiler as Title 39, chapter 53 through the use of brackets. The redesignation of the sections enacted by S.L. 1982, chapter 286 was made permanent by S.L. 1991, chapter 329.

        Section 1 of S.L. 1991, ch. 329 read, “The intent of this legislation is to ensure that the adult population (eighteen (18) years of age and older) in the state of Idaho is protected from abuse, neglect and exploitation through the joint efforts of the Idaho department of health and welfare and law enforcement services. A secondary purpose is to ensure that these protective services are provided in the least restrictive environment to assure maximum independence of the individuals served. Nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize or obligate the department to act or intervene in situations more appropriately addressed in the domestic violence act.”

        Two 1982 acts, chapters 181 and 286, purported to create a new chapter 52 in Title 39. Chapter 181 was compiled as Title 39, chapter 52 (§§ 39-5201 to 39-5213) while chapter 286 was designated by the compiler as Title 39, chapter 53 through the use of brackets. The redesignation of the sections enacted by S.L. 1982, chapter 286 was made permanent by S.L. 1991, chapter 329.

Further, the commission shall honor a vulnerable adult’s freedom of choice and right to self-determination. When it becomes necessary for the commission to assist a vulnerable adult, actions shall be tempered by the requirements of due process and must place the fewest possible restrictions on personal freedom.

        Two 1982 acts, chapters 181 and 286, purported to create a new chapter 52 in Title 39. Chapter 181 was compiled as Title 39, chapter 52 (§§ 39-5201 to 39-5213) while chapter 286 was designated by the compiler as Title 39, chapter 53 through the use of brackets. The redesignation of the sections enacted by S.L. 1982, chapter 286 was made permanent by S.L. 1991, chapter 329.

        This section was amended by two 1998 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together. However, the two acts added and redesignated subsections differently. The compiler initially resolved the differences which were permanently resolved by the amendment of this section by S.L. 2000, chapter 274.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 308, § 4, in subsection (1), at the end of the first sentence, deleted “of health and welfare” following “under this chapter to the department”, added present subsections (2) and (3), redesignated former subsection 2 as present subsection (4), and in present subsection (4), deleted “provision of” following “testimony or,” and inserted “provided in good faith,” and added subsection (5).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 396, § 1, added the present second sentence in subsection (1); designated the second sentence of former subsection (1) as the first sentence of present subsection (2), and added the second sentence of subsection (2), and its subdivisions, and redesignated former subsection (2) as present subsection (3).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 56, deleted “ombudsman for the elderly” preceding “osteopath, optometrist” in the first sentence of subsection (1).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 43, substituted “providers” for “contractors” near the end of subsection (3) and near the beginning of subsection (4).

Alternatively, the interview may occur in the local office of the commission or provider, or by telephone conversation, or by any other means available to the commission or provider.

      <li id="t39c55s39-5501ol11">
       Public health officials have concluded that secondhand tobacco smoke causes disease, including lung cancer and heart disease, in nonsmoking adults, as well as causes serious conditions in children such as asthma, respiratory infections, middle ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome. In addition, public health officials have concluded that secondhand smoke can exacerbate adult asthma and allergies and cause eye, throat and nasal irritation. The conclusions of public health officials concerning secondhand tobacco smoke are sufficient to warrant measures that regulate smoking in public places in order to protect the public health and the health of employees who work at public places.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose and intent of this chapter is to authorize personal assistance services for medicaid eligible participants in the participant’s home and community. It is further the purpose of this chapter to help maintain these eligible participants in their own homes in order to provide for the greatest degree of independence and self-reliance possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Personal assistance services are an integral component of the long-term care service delivery system and they are to be designed to provide a range of services for persons who are elderly, for persons with disabilities and for children who meet medical necessity criteria for personal care services (PCS). These services are to help individuals compensate for functional limitations and are to be delivered over a sustained period of time to persons who lost or never acquired some degree of functional capacity. Services will be viewed as enhancing the quality of life, individual choice, consumer control, independence and community integration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Personal assistance services related to functional need shall be provided in order to maintain the independence, privacy, and dignity of the individual in the least restrictive, most cost-effective setting.
     </p>
     <p>
      The participant and, at the option of the participant, the family of the participant, if available, shall be involved in the development of the individual service plan based on the participant’s needs identified through an assessment conducted by the department.

      § 39-5701. Legislative findings and intent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The prevention of youth access to tobacco products and electronic smoking devices within the state of Idaho is hereby declared to be a state goal to promote the general health and welfare of Idaho’s young people.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Idaho, and nicotine is a highly addictive, potentially harmful substance. Both present an urgent public health challenge. New and emerging tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery devices like electronic cigarettes are linked to an increase in youth use of tobacco and nicotine products, are connected to the use of traditional tobacco products like cigarettes, and are associated with increased addiction in youth users. Therefore, it is this state’s policy to prevent the illegal sale, theft, and easy access of tobacco products and electronic smoking devices to minors, to prohibit the possession, distribution, and use of tobacco products and electronic smoking devices by minors, and to otherwise discourage and prevent the possession, use, and trafficking in tobacco products and electronic smoking devices by minors.

        The legislature passed the prevention of minors’ access to tobacco act in an effort to prevent minors from accessing tobacco products, in part by regulating who is authorized to sell tobacco. This section is concerned with the introduction of any tobacco products into Idaho by anyone not first obtaining a tobacco permit; the act is a non-discriminatory statute regulating the off-reservation conduct of a Native American.

       </h3>
       <p>
        Sale or distribution of tobacco products or electronic smoking devices, or any violation of this chapter, without a permit is considered by the state of Idaho as an effort to subvert the state’s public purpose to prevent minor’s access to tobacco products or electronic smoking devices.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t39c57s39-5709ol11">
         The sale or distribution of tobacco products or electronic smoking devices without a permit shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) months in the county jail, a fine of three hundred dollars ($300), or by both such fine and imprisonment. If the sale or distribution of tobacco products or electronic smoking devices was to a minor, the fine shall be no less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to an employee of the business engaged in the sale of tobacco products or electronic smoking devices if the sale occurred during the course of such employment and the seller does not have an ownership interest in the business.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c57s39-5709ol12">
         In addition to the penalties set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the court may impose an additional fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day beginning the day following the date of citation as long as the illegal tobacco products or electronic smoking devices sales or distribution continues. The first seven (7) days of additional fines may be suspended, provided that the business or seller is able to prove that the business or seller has applied for the permit within seven (7) days of the citation.

      <li id="t39c58s39-5802ol11">
       The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby finds that adverse public health and environmental impacts can result from the improper land disposal of hazardous waste and that the need for establishing safe sites with adequate capacity for the disposal of hazardous waste is a matter of statewide concern, and the provisions of this chapter are therefore enacted to provide an effective method of establishing such sites.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5802ol12">
       It is the intent of the legislature of the state of Idaho that generators of hazardous waste be encouraged to use on-site and off-site alternative treatment methods to reduce the amount of hazardous waste that must be discharged into the environment and to reduce associated hazards to the health and welfare of the citizens of this state. Alternative management technologies which detoxify, stabilize and reduce the amount of hazardous waste that must be buried are available. For such purpose, the provisions of this chapter are enacted to allow the development of safe alternative methods for the treatment of hazardous waste and to provide a means for the designation of hazardous waste disposal sites when such methods are unable to obviate the need for hazardous waste disposal on land. Whereas the state of Idaho may be responsible for the perpetual care of hazardous waste land disposal facilities, alternative technologies such as incineration, resource recovery, or physical, chemical or biological degradation should be implemented to the maximum extent possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5802ol13">
       It is the intent of the legislature that the site license process not duplicate the existing hazardous waste management act permitting process as set forth in section 39-4409, Idaho Code. The site license is a preliminary, general review which is not based on the type of specific, detailed technical information required for the hazardous waste management act permit.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5820ol11">
       Before construction of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, but in no case later than nine (9) months after approval of a site license for a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, any owner or user of real property adversely affected by approval may bring an action in a district court of competent jurisdiction against the owner of the proposed facility. If the court determines that the planned construction and operation of the hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility will result in the devaluation of the plaintiff’s property or will otherwise interfere with the plaintiff’s rights in the property, it shall order the owner to compensate the plaintiff in an amount equal to the value of the plaintiff’s loss.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5820ol12">
       The remedy provided in subsection (1) of this section shall be in addition to other remedies provided by law for owners or users aggrieved by the proposed construction and operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5820ol13">
       Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an owner or user of property aggrieved by the construction and operation of a facility from seeking damages that result from a subsequent modification of the design or operation of a facility but such damages are limited to the incremental damage that results from the modification. Any action for such damages under this section shall be brought within nine (9) months after the siting license for modification of the design or operation of the facility is approved.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5820ol14">
       For the purpose of assessing damages, the value of the rights affected is fixed at the date the siting license is approved and the actual value of the right at that date is the basis for the determination of the amount of damage suffered, and no improvements to the property subsequent to the date of approval of the plans shall be included in the assessment of damages. Similarly, for any subsequent modification of a facility, value is fixed at the date of approval of the siting license.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5820ol15">
       The owner or operator of a proposed facility may, at any time before an award of damages, abandon the construction or operation of the facility or any modification and cause the action to be dismissed. As a condition of dismissal, however, the owner or operator shall compensate the plaintiff for any actual damage sustained as a result of construction or operation of the facility before abandonment together with court costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c58s39-5820ol16">
       Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a court from enjoining any activity at a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility that is outside of, or not in compliance with, the terms and conditions of an approved hazardous waste operations permit pursuant to section 39-4409, Idaho Code.

        Section 1 of S.L. 1985, ch. 31 read: “The legislature hereby declares that the children of the state of Idaho are its single greatest resource and that these children require the utmost protection to guard their future and the future of the state. The legislature recognizes that child abuse and neglect is a threat to the family unit and imposes major expenses on society. The legislature further declares that there is a need to assist private and public agencies in identifying and establishing community-based educational and service programs for the prevention of child abuse and neglect. It is the intent of the legislature that an increase in prevention programs will help break the cycle of child abuse and will help reduce the breakdown in families and thus reduce the need for state intervention and state expenses. It is further the intent of the legislature that prevention of child abuse and child neglect programs are partnerships between communities, citizens, and the state.”

     </h3>
     <p>
      Under this chapter, rural and underserved communities in Idaho would be able to apply for the placement of a foreign trained physician after demonstrating that they are unable to recruit an American physician, and all other recruitment/placement possibilities have proven to be inaccessible.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c61s39-6102ol11">
       The “Idaho Conrad J-1 Visa Waiver Program” authorizes the Idaho department of health and welfare to recommend up to thirty (30) foreign trained physicians per federal fiscal year to locate in communities that are federally designated as having a health workforce shortage. No more than ten (10) of thirty (30) recommendations may be for physician specialists other than pediatrics, internal medicine, family medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, psychiatry or general surgery. Applications for specialists must demonstrate a need for the type of specialty held by the petitioning physician. Final approval of J-1 visa waiver requests are made by the United States bureau of citizenship and immigration services.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c61s39-6102ol12">
       Provided health care organizations located in federally designated shortage areas do not utilize the full annual allocation of J-1 visa waivers, the department will accept no more than ten (10) waiver applications six (6) months after the beginning of each federal fiscal year for petitioning J-1 visa waiver physicians to work in areas without a federal shortage area designation. The practice and petitioning physician must serve patients who reside in federally designated areas of underservice. The maximum number of flex waiver applications available to specialists is limited to no more than five (5) per federal fiscal year.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c61s39-6102ol13">
       The “National Interest Waiver Program” allows the Idaho department of health and welfare to testify that it is in the public’s interest that a waiver be granted to a foreign trained physician who commits to locating in a community that is federally determined as having a health workforce shortage. Final approval of the national interest waiver request is made by the United States bureau of citizenship and immigration services.

      <li id="t39c61s39-6107ol11">
       Option of last resort. The J-1 visa waiver and national interest waiver programs are considered a final source for recruiting qualified physicians. These programs are not a substitute for broad recruiting efforts for graduates from United States medical schools, but an option of last resort. Any application that qualifies for consideration under any other interested government agency or federal program, such as the one administered by the department of health and human services, must be submitted under that program in lieu of the J-1 visa waiver program. The option of last resort principle does not apply to national interest waiver petitioning physicians for whom a J-1 visa waiver request was issued by the state of Idaho; in which case, physician retention is the objective if it is determined to be in the public interest.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c61s39-6107ol12">
       Waiver request applications will only be considered for health care facilities that can provide evidence of sustained active recruitment over a period of at least six (6) months for the physician vacancy in the practice location. The six (6) month vacancy requirement does not apply to a national interest waiver petitioning physician for whom a J-1 visa waiver request was issued by the state of Idaho.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c61s39-6107ol13">
       The J-1 visa waiver program and national interest waiver program will be used to assist health care facilities that can document the provision of health care services to all residents of the federally determined area of underservice. When a federal designation is for an underserved population, the health care facility must document the provision of care to, and assure access by, the underserved population.

       Notification of waiver status and commencement of employment must be submitted to the department upon receipt of written notification of approval from the immigration agency. This notification must include the date the medical service obligation commences, and a copy of the notification of approval from the immigration agency.

       The waiver physician and the applicant must, on commencement of practice and annually thereafter or more frequently as determined by the department, and upon expiration of the physician’s service obligation to the underserved area, verify the physician’s practice site address and field of practice. Further, documentation that the population the physician was to serve was indeed served must be submitted. This will include the facility’s payer mix, the number of patients seen by the physician, and the payer mix of those patients. When submitting the final report, the physician must indicate whether he intends to remain in the shortage area to practice.

       Sites receiving waiver approval must agree to report to the department on the status of the physician’s activities at the beginning of the physician’s employment and every year thereafter during the three (3) to five (5) year medical service obligation period. Failure to provide these reports within thirty (30) days of the annual anniversary date of approval of the J-1 visa or national interest waiver in an accurate manner or failure to demonstrate good faith in utilizing a physician’s services in accordance with these policies will jeopardize future eligibility for placements and will be cause for reporting and referral to the United States department of state and immigration agency.

      § 39-6302. Statement of purpose.
     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this chapter, the legislature adopts by reference the declaration of policy in section 39-5201, Idaho Code. Additionally, the legislature finds that a significant number of homicides, aggravated assaults, and assaults and batteries occur within the home between adult members of families. Furthermore, research shows that domestic violence is a crime which can be deterred, prevented or reduced by legal intervention. Domestic violence can also be deterred, prevented or reduced by vigorous prosecution by law enforcement agencies and prosecutors and by appropriate attention and concern by the courts whenever reasonable cause exists for arrest and prosecution.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this act is to address domestic violence as a serious crime against society and to assure the victims of domestic violence the protection from abuse which the law and those who enforce the law can provide.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature to expand the ability of the courts to assist victims by providing a legal means for victims of domestic violence to seek protection orders to prevent such further incidents of abuse. It is the intent of the legislature that the official response to cases of domestic violence shall stress the enforcement of the laws to protect the victim and shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior in the home is criminal behavior and will not be tolerated. It is the intent of the legislature to presume the validity of protection orders issued by courts in all states, the District of Columbia, United States territories and all federally recognized Indian tribes within the United States, and to afford full faith and credit to those orders. The provisions of this chapter are to be construed liberally to promote these purposes.

        Ninety-day protection order was properly entered under this chapter, because the testimony of the petitioner and the petitioner’s then spouse suggested that the spouse could act unpredictably, and in a potentially dangerous manner, and that the spouse constituted a threat to the bodily safety of both the petitioner and the petitioner’s child.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to issue a civil protection order on a child’s behalf against a father: (1) the father’s claims of a right to discipline the child and protect the father from the child did not bar the order, as the father had no parental duty to exercise the discipline used, nor did the father act in self-defense or use reasonable force, and (2) an immediate and present danger of domestic violence warranted the issuance of the order, as the child’s concussion and cervical strain were physical injuries sustained in a recent domestic violence incident.

    (5) An ex parte temporary protection order shall be effective for a fixed period not to exceed fourteen (14) days, but may be reissued. A full hearing, as provided in this chapter, shall be set for not later than fourteen (14) days from the issuance of the temporary order. The respondent shall be served with a copy of the ex parte order along with a copy of the petition and notice of the date set for the hearing. If the ex parte temporary protection order substantially affects the respondent’s rights to enter the domicile or the respondent’s right to custody or visitation of the respondent’s children and the ends of justice so require, the respondent may move the court for an order shortening the time period within which the hearing required under the provisions of section 39-6306, Idaho Code, must be held. Motions seeking an order shortening the time period must be served upon the petitioner at least two (2) days prior to the hearing on the motion. History.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2018, ch. 227 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to allow a victim of domestic violence to retain the use of an existing wireless telephone number and access to the contacts and other information that may be contained in an existing wireless telephone. For many victims of domestic violence, a wireless telephone is a lifeline to the community resources, the life-saving services and the support networks victims need in order to leave a batterer and an abusive environment. Many victims require access to a wireless telephone to obtain counseling services and legal assistance, such as securing a protection order. For these victims, a wireless telephone serves as a critical tool for making appointments and communicating with advocates. This can be a problem if the domestic violence victim is not the account holder for the wireless telephone, as only an account holder has the authority to release the telephone number or numbers contained in the account.”

      The legislature finds that the waters of Big Payette Lake and its watershed are threatened with deterioration due to expanding residential development, greater public use and growing land use activities, that these pressures may endanger the drinkability, economic potential, fisheries, natural beauty, recreational use, swimability and wildlife values of the lake; that the state holds all such public lakes in trust for the use of all its citizens; that to preserve and protect such public lakes and to increase and enhance the use and enjoyment of such lakes is in the best interest of all the citizens of the state; that natural lakes form an important basis of the state’s economy and that the increasing demand upon the lake waters of this state require coordinated state and local action to protect, preserve and improve the water qualify [quality] of the lakes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature declares that it is necessary to embark upon a program of water quality protection for the lake so that future generations of Idahoans may use and enjoy it. This act creates a program to protect, preserve and, where necessary, improve the water quality of the lake while accommodating private, public and commercial activities to the extent prudent and practicable. The program as set forth in this act shall require a working partnership of federal, state and local agencies.

       That it is the policy of the state of Idaho to provide for the protection of the public health, welfare, safety, and environment; and to foster the remediation, transfer, reuse, or redevelopment of sites or groups of sites based on the risk to human health and the environment where releases or threatened release of hazardous substances or petroleum exists. The minimization of risk to public health and the environment on a commercial and industrial site offers significant potential economic benefit to local communities and is vital to their use and reuse as sources of employment, housing, recreation and open-space areas.

      <li id="t39c72s39-7202ol12">
       That establishing a voluntary program for the remediation of hazardous substance or petroleum contaminated sites will encourage innovation and cooperation between the state, local communities, and interested persons and will promote the economic revitalization of property. It is intended that this program will provide for an expedited remediation process by eliminating the need for many adversarial enforcement actions and delays in remediation plan approvals.

          That the coordination and timeliness of response to federal law on the part of all public officials within the state is critical to compliance with federal regulations, the ability of each affected agency to carry out their statutory responsibilities and the avoidance of excessive construction and public expenditures.

        Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish a program of solid waste management which complies with 40 CFR 258 and facilitates the incorporation of flexible standards in facility design and operation. The legislature hereby establishes the solid waste disposal standards and procedures outlined herein and a facility approval process for the state of Idaho, the political subdivisions thereof, and any private solid waste disposal site owner in order to facilitate the development and operation of solid waste disposal sites, to effect timely and responsible completion of statutory duties and to ensure protection of human health and the environment, to protect the air, land and waters of the state of Idaho.

      <p>
       The legislature intends that the state of Idaho enact and carry out a solid waste program that will enable the state to achieve approved state status with respect to solid waste disposal facility regulation from the federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature finds that subtitle D of RCRA, and in particular the code of federal regulations, title 40, part 257 and 258, establish complex, detailed and costly provisions for the disposal of solid waste. By the provisions of this chapter, the legislature desires to avoid duplicative or conflicting state and federal regulatory systems and allow local MSWLF unit owners the maximum flexibility possible under 40 CFR 257 and 258, to meet the substantive goals of protection of human health and the environment with consideration for actual site and climatic conditions. At any time that 40 CFR 257 or 40 CFR 258 is amended, any additional flexibility or extension otherwise prohibited by this chapter shall be allowed as applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board may not promulgate any rule pursuant to this act that would impose conditions or requirements more stringent or broader in scope than the referenced RCRA regulations of the United States environmental protection agency or the provisions of this chapter. Until regulations are adopted, agency conclusions in appendix B through appendix H, inclusive, per the “Federal Register” of October 9, 1991, shall be used for technical guidance for relevant provisions of this chapter.

After obtaining site certification, an applicant shall produce design plans and specifications which comply with the design standards set forth in sections 39-7409 and 39-7410, Idaho Code. The responsibility for complying with said standards shall rest solely with the applicant of the site.
       </li>
       <li id="t39c74s39-7411ol12">
        An applicant may notify the director of its intent to initiate a MSWLF site design and meet with the director to discuss standards, schedule, design process to be used and particular concerns of the director.

        The applicant shall submit findings and a tentative design plan, including preliminary schematic design of environmental monitoring systems to the director as a result of the preliminary design investigation. The submittal initiates a twenty-eight (28) day period for department review and comment. Concurrent with the submittal to the director, the applicant shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation, as determined by the criteria in section 31-819, Idaho Code, in the county wherein the MSWLF would be located notifying the public that a preliminary design plan has been submitted to the director and is available for public review. The date of publication initiates a twenty-eight (28) day period for department review and public comment. Written public comments concerning the proposed design plan shall be compiled by the director. The compiled public comments received by the director and those generated by the director shall be transmitted to the owner, and the applicant if other than the owner, no more than thirty-five (35) days after the date of publication of the notice or seven (7) days after the end of the public comment period, whichever is later.

        When a response is received from the director, the applicant may submit the facility design, ground water monitoring program, and specifications, in a final design report which addresses standards established by this chapter, applicable federal regulations and other relevant provisions of state law. Said submittal shall include a site-specific analysis of hydrogeologic conditions, location restrictions and other factors relevant to long-term site integrity, and shall address comments from the public and the director related to objective standards in the final design report. Said submittal shall be prepared by a qualified professional in a manner consistent with sound professional practices. The submittal of this final design report initiates a fifty-six (56) day period for the director’s review.
       </li>

        Concurrent with submittal to the director, the applicant shall release the final design report, including all supporting reports, plans and documentation, to the extent practicable, for public comment by placing it for inspection at every public library within the county where the proposed MSWLF would be located. Copies of the submittal shall be made available for possession, at the cost of duplication, at a public location in the county seat of the county where the proposed MSWLF unit would be located. The applicant shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation, as determined by the criteria in section 31-819, Idaho Code, in the county wherein the MSWLF would be located notifying the public that a final design report has been submitted to the director and is available for public review. Public comments shall be submitted, in writing, to the director within twenty-eight (28) days of the date of publication.
    (7) No more than fifty-six (56) days after publication of notice of submittal, or twenty-eight (28) days after the close of an advertised public comment period, whichever is later, the director shall enter a decision either approving or disapproving the final design. The decision shall be in writing and shall make one (1) of the following findings:

        Upon entering a decision of disapproval, an automatic twenty-one (21) day stay of proceedings shall occur unless waived by the applicant. During the twenty-one (21) day stay, the director and the applicant may meet and confer to attempt to reconcile differences. At any point during that twenty-one (21) day period the director and applicant can reach an accord and approval can be granted, with construction authorized at that point. The applicant can tender a written waiver of this twenty-one (21) day reconciliation period which would initiate the requirement provided for in subsection (9) of this section. At any time in the review process or post-decision reconciliation process the applicant and director may mutually agree to extend the timeframes contained herein and may resort to mediation, arbitration, or binding arbitration to resolve differences as they mutually see fit.

       <li id="t39c74s39-7411ol19">
        If differences are not reconciled in the period set forth in subsection (8) of this section, the director shall notify the owner that the design remains disapproved. Said notice of disapproval shall incorporate the rationale for disapproval contained in the original decision of disapproval, deleting any issues resolved in the post-decision reconciliation period.
       </li>
       <li id="t39c74s39-7411ol110">
        Following final action by the director the applicant may file a petition with the district court, with concurrent notice to the director, in the county where the proposed MSWLF would be located for expedited appellate review of the director’s decision. The petition shall set forth the specific basis for the appeal and shall identify the legal and factual basis for contesting the disapproval by the director. The director shall submit a copy of the entire record upon which its disapproval has been based no more than fourteen (14) days after the date the applicant’s petition for review has been filed. Only information which has been available during the design review process may be used in the judicial review process.

        Upon the record, the applicable law, the memoranda of the respective parties, and such independent technical assistance as the court may find it necessary and appropriate to retain, the court shall evaluate the applicant’s petition and the decision by the director and shall render a decision no more than twenty-one (21) days after the completed record, and accompanying memorandum, if one is filed, are submitted to the court by the director. The court shall sustain the director’s disapproval action if it affirmatively finds that the record contains substantial evidence that the design does not comply with standards as specified pursuant to section 39-7412(7)(b) or (c), Idaho Code. If the court finds the disapproval is not supported by substantial evidence in the record, it shall reverse the director’s action and remand the matter to the director with appropriate instructions.
    (13) The procedure set forth in subsections (10) through (12) of this section are effective until January 1, 1994. On and after January 1, 1994, the applicant is entitled to judicial review pursuant to chapter 67, title 52 [chapter 52, title 67], Idaho Code. Upon waiver or expiration of the twenty-one (21) day reconciliation period, the director and the applicant shall stipulate to accelerated judicial review pursuant to court approval where the ordinary review period provided in chapter 67, title 52 [chapter 52, title 67], Idaho Code, may reasonably result in substantial increased costs to the applicant, potential violations of federal or state environmental laws or threats to the public health and environment.

      <p>
       Failure of the director to respond to an applicant’s request for approval in the manner provided herein shall constitute approval of the request. Construction shall not be initiated on a MSWLF unit until approval has been granted, except that construction prior to approval may be initiated prior to July 1, 1993, for a MSWLF unit which meets the design standard of section 39-7409(2)(a), Idaho Code.

      § 39-7701. Legislative findings.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that access to high quality health care services is a concern of all persons. However, access to such services is severely limited for some residents of the state, particularly those who reside in remote, rural areas or in the urban areas. Physicians and other health care professionals have traditionally worked to assure broad access to health care services and many are willing to volunteer their services to address the health care needs of Idahoans who may otherwise not be able to obtain such services. The public policy of this state is to encourage and facilitate voluntary provision of health care services.

      <li id="t39c78s39-7801ol1a">
       Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the state of Idaho (“state”) and to the citizens of the state. The surgeon general has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c78s39-7801ol1b">
       Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the state. Under certain health-care programs, the state may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c78s39-7801ol1c">
       Under these programs, the state pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c78s39-7801ol1d">
       It is the policy of the state that financial burdens imposed on the state by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the state to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the state or are found culpable by the courts.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c78s39-7801ol1e">
       On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the “Master Settlement Agreement,” with the state. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described therein, to pay substantial sums to the state (tied in part to their volume of sales); to fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c78s39-7801ol1f">
       It would be contrary to the policy of the state if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the state to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.

       All swine facilities regulated by section 39-104A, Idaho Code, and this chapter shall provide financial assurances demonstrating financial capability to meet requirements for closure of the facilities and remediation. Requirements for financial assurances shall be determined by the agency as set forth in rule. Financial assurances may include any mechanism or combination of mechanisms meeting the requirements established by agency rule including, but not limited to, surety bonds, trust funds, irrevocable letters of credit, insurance and corporate guarantees. The mechanism(s) used to demonstrate financial capability must be legally valid, binding and enforceable under applicable law and must ensure that the funds necessary to meet the costs of closure and remediation will be available whenever the funds are needed. The director may retain financial assurances for up to five (5) years after closure of a facility to ensure proper closure and remediation, as defined by rule.

        Legislative Findings and Intent
       </h5>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
    “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and
    “(e) Require each school district to annually set aside an adequate amount of moneys for the exclusive purpose of school building maintenance in order to arrest deterioration in school facilities that have lead to unsafe conditions and to provide a sliding scale of state match subsidies for this amount based upon the school district’s relative ability to pay.”

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c80s39-8008ol11">
       The administrator shall have authority under this section to enter all public school facilities covered by this chapter at reasonable times to inspect, on an annual basis, such facilities for compliance with the Idaho uniform school building safety code; provided however, that inspections shall take into account the age of the school facilities and the appropriate codes that would have been in effect at the time of the construction of such facilities; provided further, that regardless of the codes in effect at the time of construction, imminent safety hazards found in public school facilities shall be identified and the provisions of this chapter relating to such imminent safety hazards shall apply.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c80s39-8008ol12">
       If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes does not constitute an imminent safety hazard or serious safety hazard, he shall notify in writing the school district superintendent, principal, board member, or other person in charge. Such notification shall state, in bold print, that the citations for violations or nonconformances constitute recommendations only.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c80s39-8008ol13">
       If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes constitutes a serious safety hazard, he shall immediately issue a written order or notice requiring the school superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge to eliminate the condition without delay and within the time specified by the administrator in the notice or order, but not exceeding one (1) year. The administrator may also designate a licensed professional to independently evaluate the identified condition prior to issuing a written order to eliminate the condition.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c80s39-8008ol14">
       If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes constitutes an imminent safety hazard, he shall, within two (2) working days, designate a licensed professional to independently evaluate the identified condition prior to issuing any report under this chapter. That licensed professional shall, within fourteen (14) days, complete its independent evaluation of the condition identified by the administrator and notify the administrator of its conclusions. If the administrator determines that the condition constituting an imminent safety hazard could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before the evaluation of the designated licensed professional can be completed and before the condition can be eliminated, he shall determine the extent of the area where such condition exists and thereupon shall issue a written order or notice requiring the school district superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge to cause all persons, except those necessary to eliminate the condition, to be withdrawn from, and to be restrained from entering, such area pending the evaluation of the designated licensed professional. This order shall be withdrawn if the evaluation of the designated licensed professional does not concur with the administrator that the condition constitutes an imminent safety hazard as could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before the condition can be eliminated.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c80s39-8008ol15">
       If upon receipt of the findings of the designated licensed professional, the administrator concludes that any condition identified by such licensed professional constitutes an imminent safety hazard, the administrator shall immediately serve, or cause to be served, written notice or order upon the school district superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge describing the imminent safety hazard. The administrator shall also notify in writing the state superintendent of public instruction of such imminent safety hazard. Upon receipt of such written notice or order, the school district superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge shall require all changes necessary to eliminate the imminent safety hazard be made, without delay and within the time specified by the administrator in the notice or order. If the condition presenting an imminent safety hazard is not corrected within the specified time, or if the administrator determines that the condition constituting such imminent safety hazard could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before the condition can be eliminated, if he has not previously done so he shall determine the extent of the area where such condition exists and thereupon shall issue an order or notice requiring the school district superintendent, principal, board member, or other person in charge to cause all persons, except those necessary to eliminate the condition, to be withdrawn from, and to be restrained from entering, such area. The school district superintendent, principal, board member, or other person in charge shall assist the administrator as necessary to post such areas to prevent injury.
    (6) If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes constitutes a serious safety hazard and issues a written order or notice requiring the conditions to be eliminated in not more than one (1) year, and the school superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge contests the administrator’s finding that the condition is a serious safety hazard, then the school superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge shall have fourteen (14) days from the date of the issuance of the administrator’s written order or notice to request a hearing to initiate a contested case under chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. If a hearing is requested, the superintendent of public instruction shall appoint a hearing officer to consider the contested case. All administrative proceedings under this subsection shall be expedited as necessary to assure that serious safety hazards are eliminated as required by this section if the administrator’s initial determination that there was a serious safety hazard is confirmed in the contested case proceedings.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (7) The administrator shall monitor the school district’s progress in addressing any identified imminent safety hazard or serious safety hazard to ensure that appropriate corrective action was taken. The administrator may extend the time for completing corrective action if he deems necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) Upon completion of corrective action and verification of such completion by the division of building safety and the department of administration, the administrator shall provide a report to the state superintendent of public instruction, the local superintendent of schools and the chair of the local school board.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) Annual inspections of public school facilities conducted by the administrator under the provisions of this section shall be funded pursuant to legislative appropriation.

     <p>
      Upon failure of the district superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge to comply with the requirements stated in any notice or order relating to an imminent safety hazard or serious safety hazard, the administrator may maintain an action in the name of the state of Idaho to enjoin the district superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge from acting in violation of such notice or order or from doing any action that interferes with the administrator carrying out his statutory duties. Such action shall be brought in the district court in which said acts are claimed to have been committed by filing a verified complaint setting forth said act. The court, if satisfied from such complaint or affidavits that the act complained of has been or is being committed and will persist, may issue a temporary writ without notice or bond enjoining the defendant from the commission of such act pending final disposition of the cause. The cause shall proceed as in other causes for injunction. If, at the trial, the commission of said act by the defendant be established and the court further finds it probable that the defendant will continue in such act or similar acts, the court shall enter a decree enjoining said defendant from committing said or similar acts.

        Legislative Findings and Intent
       </h5>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
    “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
    “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) Require each school district to annually set aside an adequate amount of moneys for the exclusive purpose of school building maintenance in order to arrest deterioration in school facilities that have lead to unsafe conditions and to provide a sliding scale of state match subsidies for this amount based upon the school district’s relative ability to pay.”

        Chapters 66, 357 and 371 of S.L. 2001 each purported to enact a new chapter 81 in title 39. Accordingly, ch. 66 was codified as title 39, chapter 83 (§§ [39-8301] 39-8101 to [39-8302] 39-8102), ch. 357 was codified as title 39, ch. 82 (§§ [39-8201] 39-8101 to [39-8207] 39-8107) and ch. 371 was codified as title 39, chapter 81 (§§ 39-8101 to 39-8115). The compiler had inserted bracketed section designations in the enactments by ch. 66 and 357 to indicate the necessary change in numbering from the law as enacted. Those redesignations of the provisions enacted by S.L. 2001, ch. 357 were made permanent by S.L. 2005, ch. 25. The provisions enacted by S.L. 2001, ch. 66, § 1 were repealed by S.L. 2001, ch. 66, § 2, effective July 1, 2003.

      The Idaho legislature declares that environmental protection and improvement of the Coeur d’Alene basin to protect human health and enhance natural resources is very important to the state. Therefore, it is the policy of the state to provide in this chapter a system for environmental remediation, natural resource restoration and related measures to address heavy metal contamination in the basin. The system provided in this chapter is intended to protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the people of Idaho in a manner consistent with local, state, federal and tribal participation and resources.

       <p>
        Chapters 66, 357 and 371 of S.L. 2001 each purported to enact a new chapter 81 in title 39. Accordingly, ch. 66 was codified as title 39, chapter 83 (§§ [39-8301] 39-8101 to [39-8302] 39-8102), ch. 357 was codified as title 39, ch. 82 (§§ [39-8201] 39-8101 to [39-8207] 39-8107) and ch. 371 was codified as title 39, chapter 81 (§§ 39-8101 to 39-8115). The compiler had inserted bracketed section designations in the enactments by ch. 66 and 357 to indicate the necessary change in numbering from the law as enacted. Those redesignations of the provisions enacted by S.L. 2001, ch. 357 were made permanent by S.L. 2005, ch. 25. The provisions enacted by S.L. 2001, ch. 66, § 1 were repealed by S.L. 2001, ch. 66, § 2, effective July 1, 2003.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c82s39-8206ol11">
       A parent of the child may make a claim of parental rights of an abandoned child, abandoned pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, by filing a notice of claim of parental rights with the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare. The vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare shall maintain an abandoned child registry for this purpose which shall be subject to disclosure according to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code. The department shall provide forms for the purpose of filing a claim of parental rights, and the forms shall be made available through the vital statistics unit of the Idaho department of health and welfare and in the office of the county clerk in every county of this state. Any parent claiming a parental right of an abandoned child, abandoned pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall file the form with the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare. The form must be filled out completely and provide the name and address for service of the person asserting the parental claim and set forth the approximate date the child was left in a safe haven. The form must be signed by the person claiming the parental right and be witnessed before a notary public. The department shall record the date and time the claim of parental rights is filed with the department. The claim shall be deemed to be duly filed with the department as of the date and time recorded on the claim by the department. To be valid, a claim of parental rights must be filed before an order terminating parental rights is entered by the court. A parent that fails to file a claim of parental rights prior to entry of an order terminating their parental rights is deemed to have abandoned the child and waived and surrendered any right in relation to the child, including the right to notice of any judicial proceeding in connection with the termination of parental rights or adoption of the child. Registration of notice of commencement of paternity proceedings pursuant to chapter 15, title 16, Idaho Code, shall not satisfy the requirements of this section.

       Prior to the time set for hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights filed by the department of health and welfare, and prior to entry of an order terminating parental rights by the court, the department of health and welfare shall obtain and file with the court a certificate from the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare, signed by the state registrar of vital statistics, which certificate shall state that a diligent search has been made of the registry of claims of parental rights of abandoned children, abandoned pursuant to this chapter, and shall set forth the results of that search.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c82s39-8206ol13">
       If a claim of parental rights is made before an order terminating parental rights is entered by the court, notice pursuant to section 16-2007, Idaho Code, will be required and the court shall hold the action for involuntary termination of parental rights in abeyance for a period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days unless otherwise ordered by the court. During that period:
    (a) The court shall order genetic testing to establish maternity or paternity, at the expense of the person or persons claiming the parental right.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c82s39-8206ol14">
       If there is no showing that a parent has claimed a parental right to the child, the department of health and welfare shall file with the court a certificate from the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare, signed by the state registrar of vital statistics, stating that a diligent search has been made of the registry of parental claims for children abandoned pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and that no parental claim has been made. The certificate shall be filed with the court prior to the entrance of the final order of termination of parental rights.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (b) The department of health and welfare shall conduct an investigation pursuant to section 16-2008, Idaho Code, and in those cases where a guardian ad litem has been appointed, the guardian ad litem shall have all rights, powers and duties as provided for in chapter 16, title 16, Idaho Code, and as provided for in chapter 20, title 16, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) When indicated as a result of the investigation, a shelter care hearing shall be conducted by the court in accordance with section 16-1615, Idaho Code, within forty-eight (48) hours, or at an earlier time if ordered by the court, to determine whether the child should remain in the physical custody of the department or be released to a parent or other third party.
     </p>
     <p>
      (d) Further proceedings shall be conducted as the court determines appropriate. However, where a claim of parental rights is made before an order terminating parental rights is entered by the court, a parent shall not be found to have neglected or abandoned a child placed in accordance with this chapter solely because the child was left with a safe haven.

      The legislature finds that violations of Idaho’s tobacco master settlement agreement act threaten the integrity of Idaho’s master settlement agreement with leading tobacco product manufacturers, the fiscal soundness of the state, and the public health. The legislature finds that enacting procedural enhancements will help prevent violations of Idaho’s tobacco master settlement agreement act and thereby safeguard the master settlement agreement, the fiscal soundness of the state and the public health.

        Chapters 33 and 231 of S.L. 2003 each purported to enact a new chapter 84 in title 39. Accordingly, ch. 33 was codified as title 39, chapter 84 (§§ 39-8401 to 39-8407) and ch. 231 was codified as title 39, chapter 84[85] (§§ 39-8401 [39-8501] to 39-8404 [39-8504]). The chapter enacted by S.L. 2003, ch. 231 was subsequently amended and permanently redesignated as title 39, chapter 85, Idaho Code, by S.L. 2004, ch. 318.

        State has subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this chapter and to prevent non-compliant cigarettes from being imported into Idaho because a Native American retailer’s importation of non-compliant cigarettes into Idaho was an off-reservation activity, and the retailer’s activities were not limited to reservations.

       Citizens of Idaho experiencing a behavioral health crisis are often incarcerated, hospitalized or treated in hospital emergency departments because an appropriate level of care to meet their needs is not available.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c91s39-9102ol12">
       Hospital emergency departments, jails and law enforcement agencies in Idaho have become the default providers of crisis intervention to Idaho citizens with behavioral health disorders.

       Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that behavioral health community crisis centers, hereinafter referred to as crisis centers, be developed and operated, as funding is appropriated, to provide the appropriate level of care to meet the needs of Idahoans experiencing behavioral health crises.

     <p>
      It is the policy of the state of Idaho to promote personal responsibility for health care and the cost-effective delivery of medical services by encouraging innovative use of direct patient-provider practices for primary medical care. Direct patient-provider practices utilize a model of periodic fees for provider access and medical management over time, rather than simply a fee for visit or procedure service model. Some patients and individual primary care providers may wish to establish direct agreements with one another as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service care financed through health insurance. The purpose of this act is to confirm that direct patient-provider agreements that satisfy the provisions of this chapter do not constitute insurance.

     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature to provide the opportunity for terminally ill patients to have access to certain investigational treatments without requiring another party, including a physician, manufacturer, insurer or government agency, to offer, provide or pay for such treatments. By enacting this chapter, the legislature intends only to permit these treatments to terminally ill patients in Idaho. It is not the intent of the legislature to create an obligation but to ensure that all persons or parties availing themselves of this chapter do so voluntarily. Due to the experimental nature of these treatments, it is further the intent of the legislature to protect physicians and other parties from civil, criminal or professional liability relating to the treatments.

         Surgical abortion is an invasive procedure that can cause severe physical and psychological complications for women, both short-term and long-term, including, but not limited to, uterine perforation, cervical perforation, infection, bleeding, hemorrhage, blood clots, failure to actually terminate the pregnancy, incomplete abortion, retained tissue, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, missed ectopic pregnancy, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, renal failure, metabolic disorder, shock, embolism, coma, placenta previa in subsequent pregnancies, preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies, free fluid in the abdomen, adverse reactions to anesthesia and other drugs, an increased risk for developing breast cancer, psychological or emotional complications such as depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety and sleeping disorders, and death;

        <li id="t39c95s39-9502ol11d">
         To facilitate reliable scientific studies and research on the safety and efficacy of abortion, it is essential that the medical and public health communities have access to accurate information both on the abortion procedure and on complications resulting from abortion;

         Abortion and complication reporting provisions do not impose an undue burden on a woman’s right to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. Specifically, the “collection of information with respect to actual patients is a vital element of medical research, and so it cannot be said that the requirements serve no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult,” as found by the United States Supreme Court in

         In July 2011, the FDA reported two thousand two hundred seven (2,207) adverse events after women used RU-486 for abortions. Among these events were fourteen (14) deaths, six hundred twelve (612) hospitalizations, three hundred thirty-nine (339) blood transfusions, and two hundred fifty-six (256) infections, including forty-eight (48) severe infections;

         The adverse event reports systems relied upon by the FDA have limitations and typically detect only a small proportion of events that actually occur.
