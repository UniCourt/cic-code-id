     Where the final accounting and distribution of an estate occurred in November 1975, an action commenced in May 1976 which alleged fraud by the personal representatives was timely filed, even though actual prosecution of the action did not take place until 1978, since the commencement of the action in 1976 was within the two year limitation period contained in this section. Cahoon v. Seaton, 102 Idaho 542, 633 P.2d 607 (1981).

    <p>
     This is an overriding provision that provides an exception to the procedures and limitations provided in the Code. The remedy of a party wronged by fraud is intended to be supplementary to other protections provided in the Code and can be maintained outside the process of settlement of the estate. Thus, if a will which is known to be forgery is probated informally, and the forgery is not discovered until after the period for contest has run, the defrauded heirs still could bring a fraud action under this section. Or if a will is fraudulently concealed after the testator’s death and its existence not discovered until after the basic three year period (section 3-108) has elapsed, there still may be an action under this section. Similarly, a closing statement normally provides binding protection for the personal representative after six months from filing (section 3-1005). However, if there is fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment in the preparation of the claim, a later suit may be brought under this section against the personal representative for damages; or restitution may be obtained from those distributees who benefit by the fraud. In any case innocent purchasers for value are protected.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any action under this section is subject to usual rules of res judicata; thus, if a forged will has been informally probated, an heir discovers the forgery, and then there is a formal proceeding under section 3-1001 of which the heir is given notice, followed by an order of complete settlement of the estate, the heir could not bring a subsequent action under section 1-106 but would be bound by the litigation in which the issue could have been raised. The usual rules for securing relief for fraud on a court would govern, however
    </p>
    <p>
     The final limitation in this section is designed to protect innocent distributees after a reasonable period of time. There is no limit (other than the 2 years from discovery of the fraud) against the wrongdoer. But there ought to be some limit after which innocent persons who have built up expectations in good faith cannot be deprived of the property by a restitution action.
    </p>
    <p>
     The time of “discovery” of a fraud is a fact question to be determined in the individual case. In some situations persons may not actually know that a fraud has been perpetrated but have such strong suspicion and evidence that a court may conclude there has been a discovery of the fraud at that stage. On the other hand there is no duty to exercise reasonable care to discover fraud; the burden should not be on the heirs and devisees to check on the honesty of the other interested persons or the fiduciary.

       A certified or authenticated copy of any record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that a person is missing, detained, dead, or alive is prima facie evidence of the status and of the dates, circumstances and places disclosed by the record or report;

        The probate court of Ada County did not have jurisdiction to appoint an administrator for a resident of California, who was killed in an automobile accident in Payette County, merely on the basis that the nonresident had left an asset in Idaho, to wit an automobile liability insurance policy, and such appointment was void and subject to collateral attack.

        General rule prevails here that succession to and disposition of and distribution of personal property is controlled by the law of the domicil of owner, or intestate, at time of his death, without regard to where property is located or where owner died.

       A general power, as used here and in Section 1-108, is one which enables the power holder to draw absolute ownership to himself. The section assumes a valid general power. If the validity of the power itself were in issue, the power holder could not represent others, as for example, the takers in default.

       A will or trust of a decedent who dies after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, that contains a formula referring to the “unified credit,” “estate tax exemption,” “applicable exemption amount,” “applicable credit amount,” “applicable exclusion amount,” “generation-skipping transfer tax exemption,” “GST exemption,” “marital deduction,” “maximum marital deduction” or “unlimited marital deduction,” or that measures a share of an estate or trust based on the amount that can pass free of federal estate taxes or the amount that can pass free of federal generation-skipping transfer taxes, or that is otherwise based on a similar provision of federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax law, shall be deemed to refer to the federal estate and generation-skipping transfer tax laws as they apply with respect to estates of decedents dying in 2010, without regard to whether the decedent’s personal representative or other fiduciary elects not to have the estate tax apply with respect to that estate.

A proceeding under this section shall be commenced before January 1, 2012. In a proceeding under this section, the court may consider extrinsic evidence that contradicts the plain meaning of the will, trust or other instrument. The court shall have the power to modify a provision of the will, trust or other instrument that refers to the federal estate tax or generation-skipping tax laws as described in subsection (1) of this section to:

As used in the subsection, “interested persons” means persons whose consent would be required in order to achieve a binding settlement were the settlement to be approved by the court. In the case of a trust, the agreement may be by nonjudicial settlement agreement pursuant to chapter 8, title 15, Idaho Code. Any interested person may petition the court to approve the agreement or to determine whether all interested persons are parties to the agreement, either in person or by adequate representation where permitted by law, and whether the agreement contains terms the court could have properly approved.

        The general rule is that succession and distribution of personal property, wherever situated, is governed by the lex domicilii of the owner or intestate at the time of his death: but, so far as creditors are concerned, each state will deal with the property of a decedent within its jurisdiction according to its own laws.

        Part 1 of Article II [Chapter 2] contains the basic pattern of intestate succession historically called descent and distribution. It is no longer meaningful to have different patterns for real and personal property, and under the proposed statute all property not disposed of by a decedent’s will passes to his heirs in the same manner. The existing statutes on descent and distribution in the United States vary from state to state. The most common pattern for the immediate family retains the imprint of history, giving the widow a third of realty (sometimes only for life by her dower right) and a third of the personalty, with the balance passing to issue. Where the decedent is survived by no issue, but leaves a spouse and collateral blood relatives, there is wide variation in disposition of the intestate estate, some states giving all to the surviving spouse, some giving substantial shares to the blood relatives. The Code attempts to reflect the normal desire of the owner of wealth as to disposition of his property at death, and for this purpose the prevailing patterns in wills are useful in determining what the owner who fails to execute a will would probably want.
    A principal purpose of this Article [Chapter] and Article III [Chapter 3] of the Code is to provide suitable rules and procedures for the person of modest means who relies on the estate plan provided by law. For a discussion of this important aspect of the Code, see 3 Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal (Fall 1968) p. 199.

       This section gives the surviving spouse a larger share than most existing statutes on descent and distribution. In doing so, it reflects the desires of most married persons, who almost always leave all of a moderate estate or at least one-half of a larger estate to the surviving spouse when a will is executed. A husband or wife who desires to leave the surviving spouse less than the share provided by this section may do so by executing a will, subject of course to possible election by the surviving spouse to take an elective share of one-third under Part 2 of this Article [Chapter]. Moreover, in the small estate (less than $50,000 after homestead allowance, exempt property, and allowances) the surviving spouse is given the entire estate if there are only children who are issue of both the decedent and the surviving spouse; the result is to avoid protective proceedings as to property otherwise passing to their minor children. [Idaho did not adopt the provisions directing the passing of the first $50,000 before dividing intestate shares.]
    See Section 2-802 for the definition of spouse which controls for purposes of intestate succession.

       This section provides for inheritance by lineal descendants of the decedent, parents and their descendants, and grandparents and collateral relatives descended from grandparents; in line with modern policy, it eliminates more remote relatives tracing through great-grandparents.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general the principle of representation (which is defined in Section 2-106) is adopted as the pattern which most decedents would prefer.
    If the pattern of this section is not desired, it may be avoided by a properly executed will or, after the decedent’s death, by renunciation by particular heirs under Section 2-801.

     <p>
      Any person who fails to survive the decedent by one hundred twenty (120) hours is deemed to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of homestead allowance, exempt property and intestate succession, and the decedent’s heirs are determined accordingly. If the time of death of the decedent or of the person who would otherwise be an heir, or the times of death of both, cannot be determined, and it cannot be established that the person who would otherwise be an heir has survived the decedent by one hundred twenty (120) hours, it is deemed that the person failed to survive for the required period. This section is not to be applied where its application would result in a taking of intestate estate by the state under section 15-2-105[, Idaho Code,] of this Part.

       This section is a limited version of the type of clause frequently found in wills to take care of the common accident situation, in which several members of the same family are injured and die within a few days of each other. The Uniform Simultaneous Death Act provides only a partial solution, since it applies only if there is no proof that the parties died otherwise than simultaneously. This section requires an heir to survive by five days in order to succeed to decedent’s intestate property, for a comparable provision as to wills, see Section 2-601. This section avoids multiple administrations and in some instances prevents the property from passing to persons not desired by the decedent. The five-day period will not hold up administration of a decedent’s estate because sections 3-302 and 3-307 prevent informal probate of a will or informal issuance of letters for a period of five days from death. The last sentence prevents the survivorship requirement from affecting inheritances by the last eligible relative of the intestate who survives him for any period.
    I.R.C. § 2056(b) (3) makes it clear that an interest passing to a surviving spouse is not made a “terminable interest” and thereby disqualified for inclusion in the marital deduction by its being conditioned on failure of the spouse to survive a period not exceeding six months after the decedent’s death, if the spouse in fact lives for the required period. Thus, the intestate share of a spouse who survives the decedent by five days is available for the marital deduction. To assure a marital deduction in cases where one spouse fails to survive the other by the required period, the decedent must leave a will. The marital deduction is not a problem in the typical intestate estate. The draftsmen and Special Committee concluded that the statute should accommodate the typical estate to which it applies, rather than the unusual case of an unplanned estate involving large sums of money.

      <p>
       Under the system of intestate succession in effect in some states, property is directed to be divided “per stirpes” among issue or descendants or identified ancestors. Applying a meaning commonly associated with the quoted words, the estate is first divided into the number indicated by the number of children of the ancestor who survive, or who leave issue, who survive. If, for example, the property, is directed to issue “per stirpes” of the intestate’s parents, the first division would be by the number of children of parents (other than the intestate) who left issue surviving even though no person of this generation survives. Thus, if the survivors are a child and a grandchild of a deceased brother of the intestate and five children of his deceased sister, the brother’s descendants would divide one-half and the five children of the sister would divide the other half. Yet if the parent of the brother’s grandchild also had survived, most statutes would give the seven nephews and nieces equal shares because it is commonly provided that if all surviving kin are in equal degree, they take per capita.
      </p>
      <p>
       The draft rejects this pattern and keys to a system which assures that the first and principal division of the estate will be with reference to a generation which includes one or more living members.

      If a person dies intestate as to all his estate, property which he gave in his lifetime to an heir is treated as an advancement against the latter’s share of the estate only if declared in a contemporaneous writing by the decedent or acknowledged in writing by the heir to be an advancement. For this purpose the property advanced is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of death of the decedent, whichever first occurs. If the recipient of the property fails to survive the decedent, the property is not taken into account in computing the intestate share to be received by the recipient’s issue, unless the declaration or acknowledgment provides otherwise. If an advancement exceeds the share of the heir, no refund is required.

       This section alters the common law relating to advancements by requiring written evidence of the intent that an inter vivos gift be an advancement. The statute is phrased in terms of the donee being an “heir” because the transaction is regarded as of decedent’s death; of course, the donee is only a prospective heir at the time of the transfer during lifetime. Most inter vivos transfers today are intended to be absolute gifts or are carefully integrated into a total estate plan. If the donor intends that any transfer during lifetime be deducted from the donee’s share of his estate, the donor may either execute a will so providing or, if he intends to die intestate, charge the gift as an advance by a writing within the present section. The present section applies only when the decedent died intestate and not when he leaves a will.
    This section applies to advances to collaterals (such as nephews and nieces) as well as to lineal descendants. The statute does not spell out the method of taking account of the advance, since this process is well settled by the common law and is not a source of litigation.

       The purpose of this section is to eliminate the ancient rule that an alien cannot acquire or transmit land by descent, a rule based on the feudal notions of the obligations of the tenant to the King. Although there never was a corresponding rule as to personalty, the present section is phrased in light of the basic premise of the Code that distinctions between real and personal property should be abolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section has broader vitality in light of the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429, 88 S. Ct. 664, 19 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1968) holding unconstitutional a state statute providing for escheat if a nonresident alien cannot meet three requirements: the existence of a reciprocal right of a United States citizen to take property on the same terms as a citizen or inhabitant of the foreign country, the right of United States citizens to receive payment here of funds from estates in the foreign country, and the right of the foreign heirs to receive the proceeds of the local estate without confiscation by the foreign government. The rationale was that such a statute involved the local probate court in matters which essentially involve United States foreign policy, whether or not there is a governing treaty with the foreign country. Hence, the statute is “an intrusion by the State into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and the Congress.”

       This section prevents double inheritance. It has potential application in a case in which a deceased person’s brother or sister marries the spouse of the decedent and adopts a child of the former marriage; if the adopting parent died thereafter leaving the child as a natural and adopted grandchild of its grandparents, this section prevents the child from taking as an heir from the grandparents in both capacities.

        []
       </p>
       <p>
        [Attention is called to the fact that this Part (§§ 15-2-201 — 15-2-209) as amended in 1972 varies considerably from the Uniform Probate Code for which these comments were written.] The sections of this Part describe a system for common law states designed to protect a spouse of a decedent who was a domiciliary against donative transfers by will and will substitutes which would deprive the survivor of a “fair share” of the decedent’s estate. Optional sections adapting the elective share system to community property jurisdictions were contained in preliminary drafts, but were dropped from the final Code. Problems of disherison of spouses in community states are limited to situations involving assets acquired by domiciliaries of common law states who later become domiciliaries of a community property state, and to instances where substantially all of a deceased spouse’s property is separate property. Representatives of community property states differ in regard to whether either of these problem areas warrant statutory solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost every feature of the system described herein is or may be controversial. Some have questioned the need for any legislation checking the power of married persons to transfer their property as they please. See Plager, “The Spouse’s Nonbarrable Share: A Solution in Search of a Problem”, 33 Chi. L. Rev. 681 (1966). Still, virtually all common law states impose some restriction on the power of a spouse to disinherit the other. In some, the ancient concept of dower continues to prevent free transfer of land by a married person. In most states, including many which have abolished dower, a spouse’s protection is found in statutes which give a surviving spouse the power to take a share of the decedent’s probate estate upon election rejecting the provisions of the decedent’s will. These statutes expand the spouse’s protection to all real and personal assets owned by the decedent at death, but usually take no account of various will substitutes which permit an owner to transfer ownership at his death without use of a will. Judicial doctrines identifying certain transfers to be “illusory” or to be in “fraud” of the spouse’s share have been evolved in some jurisdictions to offset the problems caused by will substitutes, and, in New York and Pennsylvania, statutes have extended the elective share of a surviving spouse to certain non-testamentary transfers.
    Questions relating to the proper size of a spouse’s protected interest may be raised in addition to those concerning the need for, and method of assuring, any protection. The traditions in both common law and community property states point toward some capital sum related to the size of the deceased spouse’s holdings rather than to the needs of the surviving spouse. The community property pattern produces one-half for the surviving spouse, but is somewhat misleading as an analogy, for it takes no account of the decedent’s separate property. The fraction of one-third, which is stated in Section 2-201 [not in Idaho], has the advantage of familiarity, for it is used in many forced share statutes.

        Although the system described herein may seem complex, it should not complicate administration of a married person’s estate in any but very unusual cases. The surviving spouse rather than the executor or the probate court has the burden of asserting an election, as well as the burden of proving the matters which must be shown in order to make a successful claim to more than he or she has received. Some of the apparent complexity arises from Section 2-202, which has the effect of compelling an electing spouse to allow credit for all funds attributable to the decedent when the spouse, by electing, is claiming that more is due. This feature should serve to reduce the number of instances in which an elective share will be asserted. Finally, Section 2-204 expands the effectiveness of attempted waivers and releases of rights to claim an elective share. Thus, means by which estate planners can assure clients that their estates will not become embroiled in election litigation are provided.

        Uniformity of law on the problems covered by this Part is much to be desired. It is especially important that states limit the applicability of rules protecting spouses so that only estates of domiciliary decedents are involved.

        Under the common law a widow was entitled to dower, which was a life estate in a fraction of lands of which her husband was seized of an estate of inheritance at any time during the marriage. Dower encumbers titles and provides inadequate protection for widows in a society which classifies most wealth as personal property. Hence, the states have tended to substitute a forced share in the whole estate for dower and the widower’s comparable common law right of curtesy. Few existing forced share statutes make adequate provisions for transfers by means other than succession to the surviving spouse and others. This and the following sections are designed to do so. The theory of these sections is discussed in Fratcher, “Toward Uniform Succession Legislation,” 41 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1037, 1050-1064 (1966). The existing law is discussed in MacDonald, Fraud on the Widow’s Share (1960). Legislation comparable to that suggested here became effective in New York on Sept. 1, 1966. See Decedent Estate Law, § 18 [CLS EPTL<cite class="id_code">§ 5-1</cite>.1].

      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of the concept of augmenting the probate estate in computing the elective share is twofold: (1) to prevent the owner of wealth from making arrangements which transmit his property to others by means other than probate deliberately to defeat the right of the surviving spouse to a share, and (2) to prevent the surviving spouse from electing a share of the probate estate when the spouse has received a fair share of the total wealth of the decedent either during the lifetime of the decedent or at death by life insurance, joint tenancy assets and other nonprobate arrangements. Thus essentially two separate groups of property are added to the net probate estate to arrive at the augmented net estate which is the basis for computing the one-third share of the surviving spouse. In the first category are transfers by the decedent during his lifetime which are essentially will substitutes, arrangements which give him continued benefits or controls over the property. However, only transfers during the marriage are included in this category. This makes it possible for a person to provide for children by a prior marriage, as by a revocable living trust, without concern that such provisions will be upset by later marriage. The limitation to transfers during marriage reflects some of the policy underlying community property. What kinds of transfers should be included here is a matter of reasonable difference of opinion. The fine-spun tests of the Federal Estate Tax Law might be utilized, of course. However, the objectives of a tax law are different from those involved here in the Probate Code, and the present section is therefore more limited. It is intended to reach the kinds of transfers readily usable to defeat an elective share in only the probate estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second category of assets, property of the surviving spouse derived from the decedent and property derived from the decedent which the spouse has, in turn, given away in a transaction that is will-like in effect or purpose, the scope is much broader. Thus, a person can during his lifetime make outright gifts to relatives and they are not included in this first category unless they are made within two years of death (the exception being designed to prevent a person from depleting his estate in contemplation of death). But the time when the surviving spouse derives her wealth from the decedent is immaterial; thus if a husband has purchased a home in the wife’s name and made systematic gifts to the wife over many years, the home and accumulated wealth she owns at his death as a result of such gifts ought to, and under this section do, reduce her share of the augmented estate. Likewise, for policy reasons life insurance is not included in the first category of transfers to other persons, because it is not ordinarily purchased as a way of depleting the probate estate and avoiding the elective share of the spouse; but life insurance proceeds payable to the surviving spouse are included in the second category, because it seems unfair to allow a surviving spouse to disturb the decedent’s estate plan if the spouse has received ample provision from life insurance. In this category no distinction is drawn as to whether the transfers are made before or after marriage.
    Depending on the circumstances it is obvious that this section will operate in the long run to decrease substantially the number of elections. This is because the statute will encourage and provide a legal base for counseling of testators against schemes to disinherit the spouse, and because the spouse can no longer elect in cases where substantial provision is made by joint tenancy, life insurance, lifetime gifts, living trusts set up by the decedent, and the other numerous nonprobate arrangements by which wealth is today transferred. On the other hand the section should provide realistic protection against disinheritance of the spouse in the rare case where decedent tries to achieve that purpose by depleting his probate estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The augmented net estate approach embodied in this section is relatively complex and assumes that litigation may be required in cases in which the right to an elective share is asserted. The proposed scheme should not complicate administration in well-planned or routine cases, however, because the spouse’s rights are freely releasable under Section 2-204 and because of the time limits in Section 2-205. Some legislatures may wish to consider a simpler approach along the lines of the Pennsylvania Estates Act provision reading:
      </p>
      <p>
       “A conveyance of assets by a person who retains a power of appointment by will, or a power of revocation or consumption over the principal thereof, shall at the election of his surviving spouse, be treated as a testamentary disposition so far as the surviving spouse is concerned to the extent to which the power has been reserved, but the right of the surviving spouse shall be subject to the rights of any income beneficiary vested in enjoyment prior to the death of the conveyor. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any contract of life insurance purchased by a decedent, whether payable in trust or otherwise.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In passing, it is to be noted that a Pennsylvania widow apparently may claim against a revocable trust or will even though she has been amply provided for by life insurance or other means arranged by the decedent. Penn. Stats. Annot. title 20, § 301.11(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       The New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law § 5-1.1(b) also may be suggested as a model. It treats as testamentary dispositions all gifts causa mortis, money on deposit by the decedent in trust for another, money deposited in the decedent’s name payable on death to another, joint tenancy property, and transfers by decedent over which he has a power to revoke or invade. The New York law also expressly excludes life insurance, pension plans, and United States savings bonds payable to a designated person. One of the drawbacks of the New York legislation is its complexity, much of which is attributable to the effort to prevent a spouse from taking an elective share when the deceased spouse has followed certain prescribed procedures.

       <p>
        The right to homestead allowance is conferred by Section 2-401, that to exempt property by Section 2-402, and that to family allowance by Section 2-403. The right to renounce interests passing by testate or intestate succession is recognized by Section 2-801. The provisions of this section, permitting a spouse or prospective spouse to waive all statutory rights in the other spouse’s property, seem desirable in view of the common and commendable desire of parties to second and later marriages to insure that property derived from prior spouses passes at death to the issue of the prior spouses instead of to the newly acquired spouse. The operation of a property settlement as a waiver and renunciation takes care of the situation which arises when a spouse dies while a divorce suit is pending.

       Section 2-508 provides that a will is not revoked by a change of circumstances occurring subsequent to its execution other than as described by that section. This section reflects the view that the intestate share of the spouse is what the decedent would want the spouse to have if he had thought about the relationship of his old will to the new situation. The effect of this section should be to reduce the number of instances where a spouse will claim an elective share.

        The failure of the court to instruct the jury on the omission of the testator to provide in his will for any of his children or for the issue of any deceased child was not prejudicial where the verdict of the jury, although general, was its answer to specific questions of fact and the succession statute had nothing to do with the ability of the jury to make answers to the special questions.

        Testatrix, aged 73, an Indian woman who could neither read, write nor speak English, who, in her will, left a life estate to son in real estate covered by her allotment, but who sold the real estate prior to her death, omitted to provide for son as though the revoked portion of her will had never been included, and son was, therefore, entitled to share in her estate as a pretermitted heir.

        This section provides for both the case where a child was born or adopted after the execution of the will and not foreseen at the time and thus not provided for in the will, and the rare case where a testator omits one of his existing children because of mistaken belief that the child is dead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the sections dealing with advancement and ademption by satisfaction (2-110 and 2-612) provide that a gift during lifetime is not an advancement or satisfaction unless the testator’s intent is evidenced in writing, this section permits oral evidence to establish a testator’s intent that lifetime gifts or nonprobate transfers such as life insurance or joint accounts are in lieu of a testamentary provision for a child born or adopted after the will. Here there is no real contradiction of testamentary intent, since there is no provision in the will itself for the omitted child.
       </p>
       <p>
        To preclude operation of this section, it is not necessary to make any provision, even nominal in amount, for a testator’s present or future children; a simple recital in the will that the testator intends to make no provision for then living children or any the testator thereafter may have would meet the requirement of (a)(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (c) and Section 3-902, any intestate estate would first be applied to satisfy the share of a pretermitted child.
    This section is not intended to alter the rules of evidence applicable to statements of a decedent.

        For decedents who die domiciled in this State, this part grants various allowances to the decedent’s surviving spouse and certain children. The allowances have priority over unsecured creditors of the estate and persons to whom the estate may be devised by will. If there is a surviving spouse, all of the allowances described in this Part, which (as revised to adjust for inflation) total $25,000, plus whatever is allowed to the spouse for support during administration, normally pass to the spouse. If the surviving spouse and minor or dependent children live apart from one another, the minor or dependent children may receive some of the support allowance. If there is no surviving spouse, minor or dependent children become entitled to the homestead exemption of $15,000 and to support allowances. The exempt property section confers rights on the spouse, if any, or on all children, to $10,000 in certain chattels, or funds if the unencumbered value of chattels is below the $10,000 level. This provision is designed in part to relieve a personal representative of the duty to sell household chattels when there are children who will have them.
    These family protection provisions supply the basis for the important small estate provisions of Article III, Part 12.
       </p>
       <p>
        States adopting the Code may see fit to alter the dollar amounts suggested in these sections, or to vary the terms and conditions in other ways so as to accommodate existing traditions. Although creditors of estates would be aided somewhat if all family exemption provisions relating to probate estates were the same throughout the country, there is probably less need for uniformity of law regarding these provisions than for any of the other parts of this article. Still, it is quite important for all states to limit their homestead, support allowance and exempt property provisions, if any, so that they apply only to estates of decedents who were domiciliaries of the state.

     <p>
      The homestead allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims against the estate except as hereinafter set forth. The homestead allowance is in addition to any share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or disabled child by the will of the decedent unless otherwise provided in the will, or by intestate succession, or by way of elective share. The amount of the homestead allowance shall be fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The homestead allowance is not a right to claim ownership of, or succession to, any homestead owned by the decedent at the time of the decedent’s death but is only the right to claim the sum set forth above.

       See Section 2-802 for the definition of “spouse” which controls in this Part. Also, see Section 2-104. Waiver of homestead is covered by Section 2-204. “Election” between the provision of a will and homestead is covered by Section 2-206.
      </p>
      <p>
       A set dollar amount for homestead allowance was dictated by the desirability of having a certain level below which administration may be dispensed with or be handled summarily, without regard to the size of allowances under Section 2-402. The “small estate” line is controlled largely, though not entirely, by the size of the homestead allowance. This is because Part 12 of Article III [Chapter 3] dealing with small estates rests on the assumption that the only justification for keeping a decedent’s assets from his creditors is to benefit the decedent’s spouse and children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason for a set amount is related to the fact that homestead allowance may prefer a decedent’s minor or dependent children over his or her other children. It was felt desirable to minimize the consequence of application of an arbitrary age line among children of the decedent.

      In addition to any homestead allowance, the decedent’s surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to [a] value, not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in excess of any security interests therein, in tangible personal property including, but not limited to, household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, family heirlooms and personal effects, subject to the terms of section 15-2-406, Idaho Code. If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent’s children are entitled jointly to the same tangible personal property, subject to the terms of section 15-2-406, Idaho Code. Rights to exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate. These rights are in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided in the will, or by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.

       As originally adopted in 1969, the dollar amount exempted was set at $3,500. To adjust for inflation, the amount was increased to $10,000 in 1990.

       Unlike the exempt amount described in Sections 2-402 and 2-404 [repealed], the exempt amount described in this section is available in a case in which the decedent left no spouse but left only adult children. The provision in this section that establishes priorities is required because of possible difference between beneficiaries of the exemptions described in this section and those described in Sections 2-402 and 2-404 [repealed].
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-204 covers waiver of exempt property rights. This section indicates that a decedent’s will may put a spouse to an election with reference to exemptions, but that no election is presumed to be required.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised, including the provisions pursuant to section 15-2-513, Idaho Code, may not be used to satisfy rights to the homestead allowance or exempt property. Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, the guardians of the minor children, or children who are adults may select property of the estate as homestead allowance or exempt property. The personal representative may make these selections if the surviving spouse, the children or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time or if there is no guardian of a minor child. The personal representative may execute an instrument to establish the homestead allowance or exempt property. The personal representative or any interested person aggrieved by any selection, determination, payment, proposed payment, or failure to act under this section may petition the court for appropriate relief. Despite any language to the contrary in this chapter, the homestead allowance and exempt property are not mandatory or automatic, but rather must be applied for by the surviving spouse and/or children, as appropriate, as set forth in this title. Even though the allowance and the right to apply for exempt property are not claims against estates, the manner of and time period for applying for the allowance or the exempt property shall be the same as set forth in sections 15-3-801, 15-3-803 and 15-3-804, Idaho Code; provided however, that the personal representative shall not be required to give actual notice to a surviving spouse or a minor or disabled child of the right to apply for the homestead allowance or the exempt property, and provided further that any notice actually given by the personal representative does not need to make any additional or special reference to an application by the surviving spouse or minor or disabled or adult children also being barred if not submitted within the time period set forth in the notice. Also, the personal representative shall not be liable to the surviving spouse, minor or disabled or adult child, any creditor, or any other successor to the estate in the same manner as provided in section 15-3-801(c), Idaho Code, as a result of giving or failing to give notice. The homestead allowance and exempt property may not be enforced or applied for on behalf of a surviving spouse or a minor or adult child of the decedent by a creditor of the surviving spouse or a minor or disabled or adult child of the decedent, or by any person or entity claiming by, through, or because of the surviving spouse or minor or disabled or adult child of the decedent. Despite any language to the contrary in other sections of this chapter, the homestead allowance and exempt property do not take precedence over reasonable administrative costs and expenses of the estate of the decedent.

        Testimony from an attorney was properly admitted that in his opinion a testator with dementia had testamentary capacity throughout his meetings with her, including on the day the will was executed. He described her as “alert,” “perky,” not distracted, and said she correctly answered questions about her family members, the value of her estate, and the current date. Wooden v. Martin (In re Conway), 152 Idaho 933, 277 P.3d 380 (2012).

        Even though a 90-year-old testator was legally blind and almost deaf, testimony that the testator was a strong-willed and independent individual who was unlikely to be overborne by beneficiaries was enough to overcome the presumption of invalidity of a will based on undue influence arising from the fact that beneficiaries were both drafters of the will and sole witnesses to its execution.

        Evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption of undue influence and find that a testator with dementia was not unduly influenced by her son, who was also her guardian, in part because she had independent and disinterested advice from an attorney, whom she met with three times, with almost no participation by the son. Wooden v. Martin (In re Conway), 152 Idaho 933, 277 P.3d 380 (2012). Cited In re Estate of Lane, 99 Idaho 850, 590 P.2d 577 (1979).

        A finding that a will was made under duress and undue influence presupposes testamentary capacity, or a sound and disposing mind. Gwin v. Gwin, 5 Idaho 271, 48 P. 295 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the special finding of a jury that a testator was competent to make a will at the time it was made is in conflict with findings that the testator was laboring under an insane delusion and was not of sound and disposing mind, the true test as to such conflicts is whether one would support a different judgment from the one entered. Gwin v. Gwin, 5 Idaho 271, 48 P. 295 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        A man may possess testamentary capacity and at the same time be unable to transact ordinary business; but and where a man is able to transact ordinary business, this is sufficient to establish his competency to make a will. Schwartz v. Taeger, 44 Idaho 625, 258 P. 1082 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        The physical and mental condition of testator as bearing on testamentary capacity before and after the time of execution of a will is admissible when not too remote, and evidence of mental condition from four to ten days before the execution of a will and one to four days thereafter is admissible.

       <p>
        An instruction to jury which suggests that a person almost bereft of mental power and understanding would still be able to make a valid will and which fails to distinguish between simple and complicated wills is bad. Hedin v. Westdala Lutheran Church, 59 Idaho 241, 81 P.2d 741 (1938).
    The mental state of deceased on the day she executed a purported will is a question of fact for the trial court sitting without a jury. In re Brown’s Estate, 61 Idaho 320, 101 P.2d 11 (1940).

        Although a testator’s will should be upheld wherever possible, a will placing the disposal of the testator’s property beyond the supervision of the courts will not be upheld. Hedin v. Westdala Lutheran Church, 59 Idaho 241, 81 P.2d 741 (1938).

       </p>
       <p>
        Questions regarding the sufficiency of evidence to sustain a finding on the issue of undue influence need not be considered where the evidence supports the court’s finding of a lack of testamentary capacity. In re Brown’s Estate, 61 Idaho 320, 101 P.2d 11 (1940).

        Where a will which gave all property to two children to the exclusion of other children was declared invalid because of undue influence exercised by said two children, they, nevertheless, remained heirs of the estate and were “tenants in common” of the estate with the other children.

    Part 5 of Article II [Chapter 2] deals with capacity and formalities for execution and revocation of wills. If the will is to be restored to its role as the major instrument for disposition of wealth at death, its execution must be kept simple. The basic intent of these sections is to validate the will whenever possible. To this end, the age for making wills is lowered to eighteen, formalities for a written and attested will are kept to a minimum, holographic wills, written and signed by the testator are authorized, choice of law as to validity of execution is broadened, and revocation by operation of law is limited to divorce or annulment. However, the statute also provides a more formal method of execution with acknowledgment before a public officer (the self-proved will). [Comment to<cite class="id_code">§ 15-2</cite>-501.]
       </p>
       <p>
        This section states a uniform minimum age of eighteen for capacity to execute a will. “Minor” is defined in Section 1-201, and may involve a different age than that prescribed here.

        This section preserves the observatory function as well as the signatory function of witnesses. In order for a will to be validly executed, each witness must have observed the testator sign the will or must have observed the testator’s acknowledgment of his or her signature or of the will; accordingly, a telephonic acknowledgment by the testator, without more, will not suffice.

        Where the magistrate found that not one of the three persons who signed the purported will as a witness ever observed decedent sign the document, and the testimony of the witnesses indicated that not one of them knew before signing the will whether decedent had affixed her signature because they only saw the one page which they signed, there was substantial evidence to support the magistrate’s finding that decedent’s will was not signed by at least two persons, each of whom witnessed the signing of the will, as required by this section.

        COMMENT TO OFFICIAL TEXT
       </h5>
       <p>
        The formalities for execution of a witnessed will have been reduced to a minimum. Execution under this section normally would be accomplished by signature of the testator and of two witnesses; each of the persons signing as witnesses must “witness” any of the following: the signing of the will by the testator, an acknowledgment by the testator that the signature is his, or an acknowledgment by the testator that the document is his will. Signing by the testator may be by mark under general rules relating to what constitutes a signature; or the will may be signed on behalf of the testator by another person signing the testator’s name at his direction and in his presence. There is no requirement that the testator publish the document as his will, or that he request the witnesses to sign, or that the witnesses sign in the presence of the testator or of each other. The testator may sign the will outside the presence of the witnesses if he later acknowledges to the witnesses that the signature is his or that the document is his will, and they sign as witnesses. There is no requirement that the testator’s signature be at the end of the will; thus, if he writes his name in the body of the will and intends it to be his signature, this would satisfy the statute. The intent is to validate wills which meet the minimal formalities of the statute.

       This section enables a testator to write his own will in his handwriting. There need be no witnesses. The only requirement is that the signature and the material provisions of the will be in the testator’s handwriting. By requiring only the “material provisions” to be in the testator’s handwriting (rather than requiring, as some existing statutes do, that the will be “entirely” in the testator’s handwriting) a holograph may be valid even though immaterial parts such as date or introductory wording be printed or stamped. A valid holograph might even be executed on some printed will forms if the printed portion could be eliminated and the handwritten portion could evidence the testator’s will. For persons unable to obtain legal assistance, the holographic will may be adequate.

       A self-proved will may be admitted to probate as provided in Sections 3-303, 3-405 and 3-406 without the testimony of any subscribing witness, but otherwise it is treated no differently than a will not self-proved. Thus, a self-proved will may be contested (except in regard to signature requirements), revoked, or amended by a codicil in exactly the same fashion as a will not self-proved. The significance of the procedural advantage for a self-proved will is limited to formal testacy proceedings because Section 3-303 dealing with informal probate dispenses with the necessity of testimony of witnesses even though the instrument is not self-proved under this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original text of this section directed that the officer who assisted the execution of a self-proved will be authorized to act by virtue of the laws of “this State”, thereby restricting this mode of execution to wills offered for probate in the state where they were executed. Also, the original text authorized only the addition to an already signed and witnessed will, of an acknowledgment of the testator and affidavits of the witnesses, thereby requiring testator and witnesses, to sign twice even though the entire execution ceremony occurred in the presence of a notary or other official. In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended the substitution of new text that eliminates these problems.

        This section simplifies the law relating to interested witnesses. Interest no longer disqualifies a person as a witness, nor does it invalidate or forfeit a gift under the will. Of course, the purpose of this change is not to foster use of interested witnesses, and attorneys will continue to use disinterested witnesses in execution of wills. But the rare and innocent use of a member of the testator’s family on a home-drawn will would no longer be penalized. This change does not increase appreciably the opportunity for fraud or undue influence. A substantial gift by will to a person who is one of the witnesses to the execution of the will would itself be a suspicious circumstance, and the gift could be challenged on grounds of undue influence. The requirement of disinterested witnesses has not succeeded in preventing fraud and undue influence; and in most cases of undue influence, the influencer is careful not to sign as witness but to use disinterested witnesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        An interested witness is competent to testify to prove execution of the will, under Section 3-406.

       This section permits probate of wills in this state under certain conditions even if they are not executed in accordance with the formalities of Section 2-502 or 2-503. Such wills must be in writing but otherwise are valid if they meet the requirements for execution of the law of the place where the will is executed (when it is executed in another state or country) or the law of testator’s domicile, abode or nationality at either the time of execution or at the time of death. Thus, if testator is domiciled in state 1 and executes a typed will merely by signing it without witnesses in state 2 while on vacation there, the Court of this state would recognize the will as valid if the law of either state 1 or state 2 permits execution by signature alone. Or if a national of Mexico executes a written will in this state which does not meet the requirements of Section 2-502 but meets the requirements of Mexican law, the will would be recognized as validly executed under this section. The purpose of this section is to provide a wide opportunity for validation of expectations of testators. When the Uniform Probate Code is widely adopted, the impact of this section will become minimal.
    A similar provision relating to choice of law as to revocation was considered but was not included. Revocation by subsequent instruments are covered. Revocations by act, other than partial revocations, do not cause much difficulty in regard to choice of laws.

        Whenever new moral and testamentary duties arise subsequent to the execution of a will, the will is revoked by presumption or operation of law, unless the objects of these duties are provided for, either by the law or the will. Morgan v. Ireland, 1 Idaho 786.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurors were properly instructed that if they found that the will was left in the possession of decedent’s attorney there was no presumption of revocation by the testator arising out of the failure to find it, unless they should find from the evidence that the will, after such entrustment, subsequently came into the decedent’s possession.

       <p>
        Where a will is left in the custody of the testator, or is readily accessible to him, or is last seen in his possession, and cannot be found after his death, a presumption arises that he destroyed the will with intent to revoke it. In re Killgore’s Estate, 86 Idaho 386, 387 P.2d 16 (1963).

        The subsequent oral declarations of the testator are not sufficient to impeach the will, although they show his dissatisfaction with the will and his intent to execute a new will. Gwin v. Gwin, 5 Idaho 271, 48 P. 295 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instrument, written, dated and signed in handwriting of deceased which contained following statement “I revoke all former wills” was sufficient to show a revocation of prior will. In re Heazle’s Estate, 72 Idaho 307, 240 P.2d 821 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a will is left in the custody of a person other than the testator and is not found after the death of the testator, there is no presumption that it was revoked. In such case oral declarations of the testator, in the absence of evidence of some act of revocation required by the statute, are not competent to prove revocation for the reason that the statute does not permit a testator orally to revoke his will. In re Killgore’s Estate, 86 Idaho 386, 387 P.2d 16 (1963).

       Revocation of a will may be by either a subsequent will or an act done to the document. If revocation is by a subsequent will, it must be properly executed. This section employs the traditional language which has been interpreted by the courts in many cases. It leaves to the Court the determination of whether a subsequent will which has no express revocation clause is inconsistent with the prior will so as to revoke it wholly or partially, and in the case of an act done to the document the determination of whether the act is a sufficient burning, tearing, canceling, obliteration or destruction and was done with the intent and for the purpose of revoking. The latter necessarily involves exploration of extrinsic evidence, including statements of testator as to intent.
    The section specifically permits partial revocation. Each Court is free to apply its own doctrine of dependent relative revocation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The section does not affect present law in regard to the case of accidental destruction which is later confirmed by revocatory intention.

      § 15-2-508. Revocation by divorce — No revocation by other changes of circumstances.
     </h3>
     <p>
      If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802[, Idaho Code,] of this code. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.

       The section deals with what is sometimes called revocation by operation of law. It provides for revocation by a divorce or annulment only. No other change in circumstances operates to revoke the will; this is intended to change the rule in some states that subsequent marriage or marriage plus birth of issue operates to revoke a will. Of course, a specific devise may be adeemed by transfer of the property during the testator’s lifetime except as otherwise provided in this Code; although this is occasionally called revocation, it is not within the present section. The provisions with regard to invalid divorce decrees parallel those in Section 2-802. Neither this section nor 2-802 includes “divorce from bed and board” as an event which affects devises or marital rights on death.
      </p>
      <p>
       But see Section 2-204 providing that a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation of separation or divorce constitutes a renunciation of all benefits under a prior will, unless the settlement provides otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this Section does not provide for revocation of a will by subsequent marriage of the testator, the spouse may be protected by Section 2-301 or an elective share under Section 2-201.

       This section adopts a limited revival doctrine. If testator executes will no. 1 and later executes will no. 2, revoking will no. 1 and still later revokes will no. 2 by act such as destruction, there is a question as to whether testator intended to die intestate or have will no. 1 revived as his last will. Under this section will no. 1 can be probated as testator’s last will if his intent to that effect can be established. For this purpose testimony as to his statements at the time he revokes will no. 2 or at a later date can be admitted. If will no. 2 is revoked by a third will, will no. 1 would remain revoked except to the extent that will no. 3 showed an intent to have will no. 1 effective.

        Purpose and Scope or Revisions.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In addition to making a few stylistic changes, several substantive changes in this section are made.
    As revised, it has been made clear that the “trust” need not have been established (funded with a trust res) during the decedent’s lifetime, but can be established (funded with a res) by the devise itself. The pre-1990 version probably contemplated this result and reasonably could be so interpreted (because of the phrase “regardless of the existence . . . of the corpus of the trust”). Indeed, a few cases have expressly stated that statutory language like the pre-1990 version of this section authorizes pour-over devises to unfunded trusts.
    E.g., Clymer v. Mayo
    , 473 N.E.2d 1084 (Mass. 1985);
    Trosch v. Maryland Nat’l Bank
    , 32 Md. App. 249, 359 A.2d 564 (1976). The authority of these pronouncements is problematic, however, because the trusts in these cases were so-called “unfunded” life-insurance trusts. An unfunded life-insurance trust is not a trust without a trust res; the trust res in an unfunded life-insurance trust is the contract right to the proceeds of the life-insurance policy conferred on the trustee by virtue of naming the trustee the beneficiary of the policy.
    See Gordon v. Portland Trust Bank
    , 201 Or. 648, 271 P.2d 653 (1954) (“[T]he [trustee as the] beneficiary [of the policy] is the owner of a promise to pay the proceeds at the death of the insured . . .”);
        Gurnett v. Mutual Life Ins. Co.
        , 356 Ill. 612, 191 N.E. 250 (1934). Thus, the term “unfunded life-insurance trust” does not refer to an unfunded trust, but to a funded trust that has not received additional funding. For further indication of the problematic nature of the idea that the pre-1990 version of this section permits pour-over devises to unfunded trusts,
        see Estate of Daniels
        , 665 P.2d 594 (Colo. 1983) (pour-over devise failed; before signing the trust instrument, the decedent was advised by counsel that the “mere signing of the trust agreement would not activate it and that, before the trust could come into being, [the decedent] would have to fund it;” decedent then signed the trust agreement and returned it to counsel “to wait for further directions on it;” no further action was taken by the decedent prior to death; the decedent’s will devised the residue of her estate to the trustee of the trust, but added that the residue should go elsewhere “if the trust created by said agreement is not in effect at my death.”)
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional revisions of this section are designed to remove obstacles to carrying out the decedent’s intention that were contained in the pre-1990 version. These revisions allow the trust terms to be set forth in a written instrument executed after as well as before or concurrently with the execution of the will; require the devised property to be administered in accordance with the terms of the trust as amended after as well as before the decedent’s death, even though the decedent’s will does not so provide; and allow the decedent’s will to provide that the devise is not to lapse even if the trust is revoked or terminated before the decedent’s death.

      Whether or not the provisions relating to holographic wills apply, a will may refer to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal property not otherwise specifically disposed of by the will, other than money, evidences of indebtedness, documents of title, and securities, and property used in trade or business. To be admissible under this section as evidence of the intended disposition, the writing must either be in the handwriting of the testator or be signed by him and must describe the items and the devisees with reasonable certainty. The writing may be referred to as one to be in existence at the time of the testator’s death; it may be prepared before or after the execution of the will; it may be altered by the testator after its preparation; and it may be a writing which has no significance apart from its effect upon the dispositions made by the will.

       As part of the broader policy of effectuating a testator’s intent and of relaxing formalities of execution, this section permits a testator to refer in his will to a separate document disposing of certain tangible personalty. The separate document may be prepared after execution of the will, so would not come within Section 2-510 on incorporation by reference. It may even be altered from time to time. It need only be either in the testator’s handwriting or signed by him. The typical case would be a list of personal effects and the persons whom the testator desired to take specified items.

        Part 6 deals with a variety of construction problems which commonly occur in wills. All of the “rules” set forth in this part yield to a contrary intent expressed in the will and are therefore merely presumptions. Some of the sections are found in all states, with some variation in wording; others are relatively new. The sections deal with such problems as death before the testator (lapse), the inclusiveness of the will as to property of the testator, effect of failure of a gift in the will, change in form of securities specifically devised, ademption by reason of fire, sale and the like, exoneration, exercise of power of appointment by general language in the will, and the kinds of persons deemed to be included within various class gifts which are expressed in terms of family relationships.

       New York Estates, Powers &amp; Trusts Law Sec. 3-5.1(h) and Illinois Probate Act Sec. 896(b) direct respect for a testator’s choice of local law with reference to personal and intangible property situated in the enacting state. This provision goes further and enables a testator to select the law of a particular state for purposes of interpreting his will without regard to the location of property covered thereby. So long as local public policy is accommodated, the section should be accepted as necessary and desirable to add to the utility of wills. Choice of law regarding formal validity of a will is in Sec. 2-506. See also Sections 3-202 and 3-408.

       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended the addition of explicit reference to the elective share described in Article II, Part 2, and the exemptions and allowances described in Article II, Part 4, as embodying policies of this state which may not be circumvented by a testator’s choice of applicable law.

       This section prevents lapse by death of a devisee before the testator if the devisee is a relative and leaves issue who survives the testator. A relative is one related to the testator by kinship and is limited to those who can inherit under Section 2-103 (through grandparents); it does not include persons related by marriage. Issue include adopted persons and illegitimates to the extent they would inherit from the devisee; see Section 1-201 and 2-109. Note that the section is broader than some existing anti-lapse statutes which apply only to devises to children and other descendants, but is narrower than those which apply to devises to any person. The section is expressly applicable to class gifts, thereby eliminating a frequent source of litigation. It also applies to the so-called “void” gift, where the devisee is dead at the time of execution of the will. This, though contrary to some decisions, seems justified. It still seems likely that the testator would want the issue of a person included in a class term but dead when the will is made to be treated like the issue of another member of the class who was alive at the time the will was executed but who died before the testator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The five day survival requirement stated in Section 2-601 does not require issue who would be substituted for their parent by this section to survive their parent by any set period.

       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended a re-ordering of the title of this section and a reversal of the original order of the subsections. This recommendation was designed to correct an unintended interpretation of the section to the effect that all of the events described in subsections (a) and (b) had relevance only when the testator was under a conservatorship. The original intent of the section, made more apparent by this re-ordering, was to prevent ademption in all cases involving sale, condemnation or destruction of specifically devised assets where testator’s death occurred before the proceeds of the sale, condemnation or any insurance, had been paid to the testator.

        Although there is some indication that more states will adopt special legislation on powers of appointment, and this Code has therefore generally avoided any provisions relating to powers of appointment, there is great need for uniformity on the subject of exercise by a will purporting to dispose of all of the donee’s property, whether by a standard residuary clause or a general recital of property passing under the will. Although a substantial number of states have legislation to the effect that a will with a general residuary clause does manifest an intent to exercise a power, the contrary rule is stated in the present section for two reasons: (1) this is still the majority rule in the United States, and (2) most powers of appointment are created in marital deduction trusts and the donor would prefer to have the property pass under his trust instrument unless the donee affirmatively manifests an intent to exercise the power.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section and Section 2-603 the intent to exercise the power is effective if it is “indicated by the will.” This wording permits a Court to find the manifest intent if the language of the will interpreted in light of all the surrounding circumstances shows that the donee intended an exercise, except, of course, if the donor has conditioned exercise on an express reference to the original creating instrument. In other words, the modern liberal rule on interpretation of the donee’s will would be available.

       This section parallels Section 2-110 on advancements and follows the same policy of requiring written evidence that lifetime gifts are to be taken into account in distribution of an estate, whether testate or intestate. Although Courts traditionally call this “ademption by satisfaction” when a will is involved, and “advancement” when the estate is intestate, the difference in terminology is not significant. Some wills expressly provide for lifetime advances by a hotchpot clause. Where the will is silent, the above section would require either the testator to declare in writing that the gift is an advance or satisfaction or the devisee to acknowledge the same in writing. The second sentence on value accords with Section 2-110 and would apply if property such as stock is given. If the devise is specific, a gift of the specific property during lifetime would adeem the devise by extinction rather than by satisfaction, and this section would be inapplicable. If a devisee to whom an advancement is made predeceases the testator and his issue take under 2-605, they take the same devise as their ancestor; if the devise is reduced by reason of this section as to the ancestor, it is automatically reduced as to his issue. In this respect the rule in testacy differs from that in intestacy; see Section 2-110.

        The purpose of the former similar section was to prevent what was deemed a wrong and injustice to those who should naturally be the recipients of the bounty of a testator — his heirs at law. It was not enacted for the public good or as a matter of state policy, but for the benefit exclusively of those named in it — the heirs at law — and as a protection against hasty and improvident gifts to charity by a testator of his entire estate to the exclusion of those who, in the judgment of the legislature, had a better claim to his bounty.

       It is the purpose of this section to tighten the methods by which contracts concerning succession may be proved. Oral contracts not to revoke wills have given rise to much litigation in a number of states; and in many states if two persons execute a single document as their joint will, this gives rise to a presumption that the parties had contracted not to revoke the will except by consent of both.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires that either the will must set forth the material provisions of the contract, or the will must make express reference to the contract and extrinsic evidence prove the terms of the contract, or there must be a separate writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract. Oral testimony regarding the contract is permitted if the will makes reference to the contract, but this provision of the statute is not intended to affect normal rules regarding admissibility of evidence.

A future interest that takes effect in possession or enjoyment after the termination of the estate or interest renounced takes effect as if the person renouncing had predeceased the decedent or the donee of the power.

        Part 8 contains three general provisions which cut across both testate and intestate succession. The first section permits renunciation; the existing law in most states permits renunciation of gifts by will but not by intestate succession, a distinction which cannot be defended on policy grounds. The second section deals with the effect of divorce and separation on the right to elect against a will, exempt property and allowances, and an intestate share. The last section, an optional provision, spells out the legal consequence of murder on the right of the murderer to take as heir, devisee, joint tenant or life insurance beneficiary.

        [Comment to Subsection (1).]
       </p>
       <p>
        Who May Disclaim:
    At common law it was settled that the taker of property under a will had the right to accept or reject a legacy or devise (per Abbott, C.J. in
        Townson v. Tickell
        , 3 B & Ald 3, 136, 106 Eng. Rep. 575, 576). The same rule prevails in the United States (
        Peter v. Peter
        , 343 Ill. 493, 175 N.E. 846 (1931) 75 A.L.R. 890). It is said that no one can make another an owner of an estate against his consent by devising it to him. See, for example,
        People v. Flanagin
        , 331 Ill. 203, 162 N.E. 848 (1928) 60 A.L.R. 305:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The law is clear that a legatee or devisee is under no obligation to accept a testamentary gift . . . and he may renounce the gift, by which act the estate will descend to the heir or pass in some other direction under the will . . .”
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the rule permitting the disclaimer of testate successions, the disclaimed interest related back to the date of the testator’s death so that the interest did not vest in the grantee but remained in the original owner as if the will had never been executed (
    People v. Flanagin
    , supra).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike the devisee or legatee, an heir had no common law power to prevent passage of title to himself by disclaimer. “An heir at law is the only person in whom the law of England vests property, whether he will or not,” declares Williams on Real Property, and adds, “No disclaimer that he may make will have any effect, though, of course, he may as soon as he pleases dispose of the property by ordinary conveyance.” (Williams on Law of Real Property 75 [2d Am. Ed. 1857]. See also 6 Page on Wills [Bowe-Parker Revision] Section 49.1.)
    The difference between testate and intestate successions in respect to the right to disclaim has produced a number of illogical and undesirable consequences. An heir who sought to reject his inheritance was subjected to the Federal gift tax on the theory that since he could not prevent the passage of title to himself, any act done to rid himself of the interest necessarily involved a transfer subject to gift tax liability [
    Hardenberg v. Com’r
    , 198 F.2d 63 (8th Cir.) cert. denied, 344 U.S. 863 (1952) aff’g 17 T.C. 166 (1951);
        Maxwell v. Com’r
        , 17 T.C. 1589 (1952). See Lauritzen, Only God Can Make an Heir, 48 NWL Rev. 568; Annotation 170 A.L.R. 435]. On the other hand, a legatee or devisee who rejected a legacy or devise under the will incurred no such tax consequences [
        Brown v. Routzahn
        , 63 F.2d 914 (6th Cir.) cert. denied, 290 U.S. 641 (1933)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (1) places an heir on the same basis as a devisee or legatee and provides that he and others upon whom successions may devolve, have the full right to disclaim in whole or in part the passage of property to them, with the same legal consequences applying in all such cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Successive disclaimers are permitted by the express inclusion of “person succeeding to a disclaimed interest” among those who may disclaim.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beneficiary:
    The term beneficiary is used in a broad sense to include any person entitled, but for his disclaimer, to possess or enjoy an equitable or legal interest, present or future, in the property or interest, including a power to consume, appoint, or apply it for any purpose or to enforce the transfer in any respect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) extends the right to disclaim to the representative of an incapacitated or protected person. This accords with the general rule that the probate or surrogate court in the exercise of its traditional jurisdiction over the person and estate of a minor or incompetent may authorize or direct the guardian, conservator or committee to exercise the right on behalf of his ward when it is in the ward’s interest to do so.
    Davis v. Mather
    , 309 Ill. 284, 141 N.E. 209 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, absent a statute, the general rule is that the right to disclaim is personal to the person entitled to exercise it, and dies with him in the absence of fraud or concealment or conflict of interest of his representative, even though the time within which the right might have been utilized has not expired and even though he may be incompetent.
    Rock Island Bank & Trust Co. v. First Nat. Bank of Rock Island
    , 26 Ill. 2d 47, 185 N.E.2d 890 (1962), 3 A.L.R.3d 114. Subsection (a) adopts this position by stating that the right to disclaim does not survive the death of the person having it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Act makes no provision here or elsewhere, for an extension of time to disclaim or other relief from a strict observance of the statutory requirements for disclaimer and the time limitations for expressing the right of disclaimer apply to persons under disability as well as to others.
       </p>
       <p>
        What May be Disclaimed:
    Subsection (1) specifies that the “succession” to any property, real or personal or interest therein, may be disclaimed, and it is immaterial whether it derives by way of will, intestacy, exercise of a power of appointment or disclaimer. It would include the right to renounce any survivorship interest in the community in a community property state. Cf.
        U.S. v. Mitchell,
        403 U.S. 190 (1971), rev’g 430 F.2d (5th Cir. 1970), aff’g 51 T.C. 641 (1969).
        <i>
         Future Interests:
        </i>
        Subsection (1) contemplates the disclaimer of future interests by reference to “beneficiary under a testamentary instrument” and “appointee under a power of appointment.” The time for making such a disclaimer is dealt with in Subsection (2).
       </p>
       <p>
        Partial Disclaimer:
    The status of partial disclaimers has been uncertain in many states. The result has often turned on whether the gift is “severable” or constitutes a “single, aggregate” gift [
        Olgesby v. Springfield Marine Bank
        , 395 Ill. 37, 69 N.E.2d 269 (1946);
        <i>
         Brown v. Routzahn
        </i>
        , supra]. Subsection (a) makes it clear that a partial, as well as a total, disclaimer is permitted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretionary administrative and investment powers under a trust have been held to constitute a “severable” interest and subject to partial disclaimer.
    Estate of Harry C. Jaecker
    , 58 T.C. 166, CCH Dec. 31, 356 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Method of Disclaiming:
    In many states no satisfactory case law has existed as to the form and manner of making disclaimers of devises or legacies under wills. See Annotation 93 A.L.R.2d 8 — What Constitutes or Establishes Beneficiary’s Acceptance of Renunciation of Bequest or Devise. Because certainty of titles and the expeditions administration of estates makes definiteness desirable in this area. Subsection (1) requires a disclaimer to (i) describe the property or interest disclaimed; (ii) declare the disclaimer and the extent thereof; and (iii) be signed by the disclaimant.

        [Comment to Subsection (2).]
       </p>
       <p>
        Time for Making Disclaimer:
    At common law, no specific time evolved within which disclaimer had to be made. The only requirement was that it be within a “reasonable” time (
        In re Wilson’s Estate
        , 298 N.Y. 398, 83 N.E.2d 852 (1949);
        Ewing v. Rountree
        , 228 F. Supp. 137 (D.C. Tenn. 1964)). As a result, divergent holdings were reached by the courts (
        <i>
         Brown v. Routzahn
        </i>
        , 63 F.2d 914 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 290 U.S. 641 (1933). Subsection (2) fixes a definite time for filing of disclaimers. This approach follows the pattern of the Federal estate tax law which prescribed the time for filing estate tax returns in terms of the decedent’s death. The time allowed should overlast the time for filing claims and contesting the will and enable the executor or administrator to know with certainty who the takers of the estate will be. On the other hand, it should not be so long as to work against an early determination of the acceptance or rejection of succession to an estate, or increase the risk of inadvertent acceptance of the benefits of the property, creating an estoppel. In the case of future interests the disclaimer period should run from the time the takers of the interest are finally ascertained and their interest indefeasibly fixed.
        <i>
         Seifner v. Weller
        </i>
        , 171 S.W.2d 617 (Mo. 1943). For the consequence of selecting too short a period, see
        <i>
         Brodhag v. U.S.
        </i>
        , 319 F. Supp. 747 (S.D. W. Va. 1970) involving a 2-month period fixed by West Virginia law.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of future interests it should be noted that the person need not wait until the occurrence of the determinative event before filing a disclaimer, but may do so at any time after the death of the decedent or donee, so long as it is made “not later than” the prescribed period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal Gift Tax Implications:
    Disclaimers have significance under the Federal gift tax law. Section 2511(a) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a gift tax upon the transfer of property by gift whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, and whether the gift is direct or indirect. The Treasury regulations under this section state that where local law gives the beneficiary, heir or next-of-kin an unqualified right to refuse to accept ownership of property transferred from a decedent, whether by will or by intestacy, a refusal to accept ownership does not constitute the making of a gift if the refusal is made within a “reasonable time” after knowledge of the existence of the transfer.
    A “reasonable time” for gift tax purposes is not defined in the Code or regulations. It has been held that the courts will look to the law of the states in determining the questions.
        Brown v. Routzahn
        , 63 F.2d 914 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 290 U.S. 641 (1933)), not conclusively, but as relevant and having probative value (
        <i>
         Keinath v. C.I.R.
        </i>
        , 480 F.2d 57 (8th Cir. 1973), rev’g, 58 T.C. 352 (1972)), and that an unequivocal disclaimer filed within 6 months of the determinative event is made within a “reasonable time.” It has been held, further, that as regards future interests, the “reasonable time” period runs from the termination of the preceding estate or interest, and not from the time the transfer was made,
        <i>
         Keinath v. C.I.R.
        </i>
        , supra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Place of Filing Disclaimer:
    Subsection (2) requires a disclaimer to be filed in the probate court. If real property or an interest therein is involved, a copy of the disclaimer may also be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds or other appropriate office in the county in which the real estate is situated. If the Torrens system is in effect, appropriate provisions should be added to comply with local law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice:
    A copy of the disclaimer is required to be delivered in person or mailed by registered or certified mail to the personal representative of other fiduciary of the decedent or of the donee of the power as the case may be.

       <p>
        Devolution of Disclaimed Property:
    When a beneficiary disclaimed his interest under a will, the question arises as to what happens to the rejected interest. In
        People v. Flanagin
        , 331 Ill. 203, 162 N.E. 848 (1928), 60 A.L.R. 305, the court, quoting the New York case of
        Burritt v. Sillman
        , 13 N.Y. 93 (1855) said that the disclaimed property will “descend to the heir or pass in some other direction under the will.” From this, it may be assumed that the court meant that if the decedent left no will, the renounced interest passed according to the rules of descent, but if he left a will, it passed according to its terms.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been generally thought that devolution in the case of disclaimer should be the same as in the case of lapse, which is controlled by sections of the probate law. Subsection (c) takes this approach. It provides that unless the will of the decedent or the donee of the power has otherwise provided, the disclaimed interest devolves as if the disclaimant had predeceased the decedent or the donee of the power. In every case the disclaimer relates back to the date of the death of the decedent or of the donee. The provision that the disclaimer “relates back”, codifies the rule that a renunciation of a devise or legacy relates to the date of death of the decedent or donee and prevents the succession from becoming operative in favor of the disclaimant. See
    In re Wilson’s Estate
    , 298 N.Y. 398, 83 N.E.2d 852 (1949). Also,
        Bouse, for use of State v. Hull
        , 168 Md. 1, 176 A. 645 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acceleration of Future Interests:
    If a life estate or other future interest is disclaimed, the problem is raised of whether succeeding interests or estates accelerate in possession or enjoyment or whether the disclaimed interest must be marshalled to await the actual happening of the contingency. Subsection (c) provides that remainder interests are accelerated, the second sentence specifically stating that any future interest which is to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the termination of the estate or interest disclaimed, takes effect as if the disclaimant had predeceased the deceased owner or deceased donee of the power. Thus, if T leaves his estate in trust to pay the income to his son for life, remainder to his son’s children who survive him, and S disclaims with two children then living, the remainder in the children accelerates; the trust terminates and the children receive possession and enjoyment, even though the son may subsequently have other children or that one or more of the living children may die during their father’s lifetime.
        Effect of Death or Disability of Person Entitled to Disclaim:
        The effect of death of a person entitled to disclaim, including one under disability, is discussed under Subsection (a). A guardian or conservator of the estate on an incapacitated or protected person may disclaim for the ward. Subsection (b) makes no provision for an extension of time or for other relief in case of disability for the observance of the statutory requirements for effective disclaimer. The intent is that the period for disclaimer applies to a person under disability as well as to others, and includes a court which purports to act on behalf of one under disability in the absence of fraud, misconduct or other unusual circumstances.

       </p>
       <p>
        Rights of Creditors and Others:
    As regards creditors, taxing authorities and others, the provision for “relation back” has the legal effect of preventing a succession from becoming operative in favor of the disclaimant. The relation back is “for all purposes” which would include, among others for the purpose of rights of creditors, taxing authorities and assertion of dower. It is immaterial that the effect is to avoid the imposition of a higher death tax than would be the case if the interest had been accepted:

        Bars to Disclaimer — Waiver — Estoppel:
    It may be necessary or advisable to sell real estate in a decedent’s estate before the expiration of the period permitted for disclaimer. In such case, the possibility of a disclaimer being filed within the period, could be a deterrent to sale and delivery of good title. Subsection (4) expressly authorizes an heir, devisee, legatee or other person entitled to disclaim, to indicate in writing his intention to “waive” his right to disclaimer, and thus avoid any delay in the completion of a sale or other disposition of estate assets. the written waiver bars the right of the person subsequently to disclaim the property or interest therein and is binding on persons claiming through or under him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, Subsection (4) provides that various acts of a person entitled to disclaim in regard to property or an interest therein, such as making an assignment, conveyance, encumbrance, pledge or transfer of the property or interest, or a contract therefor, bars the right of the person to disclaim and is binding on all persons claiming through or under him.
    Spendthrift Provisions:
    The existence of a limitation on the interest of an heir, legatee, devisee or other disclaimant in the nature of a spendthrift provision or similar restriction is expressly declared not to affect the right to disclaim. Without this provision, there might be a question as to whether the beneficiary of a spendthrift trust can disclaim under the statute (Griswold, Spendthrift Trust [2d Ed] Section 524, p. 603). If a person who is under no legal disability wishes to refuse a beneficial interest under a trust, he should not be powerless to make an effective disclaimer even though the intended interest once accepted by him would be inalienable. (Scott on Trust, Section 337.7, p. 2683, 3d Ed.)
       </p>
       <p>
        When a beneficial interest is accepted by a beneficiary, he cannot thereafter disclaim or release it (Griswold, supra, Section 534, p. 603 note 48). As to what conduct amounts to an acceptances, see
    In re Wilson’s Estate
    , 298 N.Y. 398, 83, N.E.2d 852 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judicial Sale:
    The section provides that the right to disclaim is barred by a sale of the property or interest under a judicial sale. Judicial sales are ordered in many different types of proceeding such as foreclosure of mortgage or trust deed, enforcement of lien, partition proceedings and proceedings for the sale of real property of a decedent or ward for certain purposes. Probate laws frequently permit a representative to mortgage or pledge property of the decedent or ward in certain circumstances. Execution sales are made pursuant to a writ to satisfy a money judgment. Subsection (4) has the effect of providing that the making of a judicial sale for the account of the heir, devisee, or beneficiary, bars him from renouncing the property or interest. To be distinguished from a judicial sale, is a taking pursuant to eminent domain, which is considered to be a taking of property without the owner’s comment and unrelated to his obligations or commitments. The right to disclaim the proceeds of a condemnation action if otherwise timely and in accordance with this Section, should not, therefore, be barred under Subsection (4).

       <p>
        Subsection (5) provides that the right to disclaim under the law does not abridge the right of any person to waive, release, disclaim or renounce any property or interest therein under any other statute. The principal statutes to which this provision is pointed are those dealing with spousal renunciations and release of powers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being a codification of the common law in regard to the renunciation of the property, this Section is intended to constitute an
    exclusive remedy
    for the disclaimer of testamentary successions apart from those provided by other statutes, and supplants the common law right to disclaim.

       <p>
        Subsection (6) deals with the application of this Section to property interests under instruments or in estates in existence on the effective date. If the interest is a present one and the filing time had not expired, the holder is given a full period after enactment within which to disclaim the interest. If the interest is a future one, the holder is given a full period after the interest becomes indefeasibly vested or the takers finally ascertained, after enactment in which to disclaim it. If T dies in 1960 trusteeing his estate to W for life, remainder to such of T’s sons as are living at W’s death and W dies in 1975, this Section permits a son to disclaim his remainder interest after it ripens even though it arises under an instrument predating the effective date of this Section. The application of statute to pre-existing instruments in like situations finds support in cases such as
    Wills of Allis

        []
       </p>
       <p>
        The above text, consists of Sections 1 through 6 of Uniform Disclaimer of Transfers By Will, Intestacy or Appointment Act of 1973, redesignated as subsections (a) through (f).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Comments following each subsection are the Official Comments to the 1973 statute. The word “renunciation” has been substituted for “disclaimer” because the original Section 2-801 used the term “renunciation” and several cross-references to this term appear in other sections of this Code. It is the view of the Joint Editorial Board that the terms “renunciation” and “disclaimer” have the same meaning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The principal substantive difference between original Section 2-801 and the 1973 replacement therefor is that the former permitted renunciation by the personal representative of a person who might have renounced during his lifetime. Under the new uniform act, which is now the official text of Section 2-801, the right to renounce terminates upon the death of the person who might have renounced during his lifetime. Also, the original version was less precise than the present version in the important provisions of subsection (b) which govern the time for renunciation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is designed to facilitate renunciation in order to aid postmortem planning. Although present law in all states permits renunciation of a devise under a will, the common law did not permit renunciation of an intestate share. There is no reason for such a distinction, and some states have already adopted legislation permitting renunciation of an intestate share. Renunciation may be made for a variety of reasons, including carrying out the decedent’s wishes not expressed in a properly executed will.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the rule of this section, renounced property passes as if the renouncing person had failed to survive the decedent. In the case of intestate property, the heir who would be next in line in succession would take; often this will be the issue of the renouncing person, taking by representation. For consistency the same rule is adopted for renunciation by a devisee; if the devisee is a relative who leaves issue surviving the testator, the issue will take under Section 2-605; otherwise disposition will be governed by Section 2-606 and general rules of law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The section limits renunciation to nine months after the death of the decedent or if the taker of the property is not ascertained at that time, then nine months after he is ascertained. If the personal representative is concerned about closing the estate within that nine months period in order to make distribution, he can obtain a waiver of the right to renounce. Normally this should be no problem, since the heir or devisee cannot renounce once he has taken possession of the property.
       </p>
       <p>
        The presence of a spendthrift clause does not prevent renunciation under this section.

       <p>
        See Section 2-508 for similar provisions relating to the effect of divorce to revoke devises to a spouse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although some existing statutes bar the surviving spouse for desertion or adultery, the present section requires some definitive legal act to bar the surviving spouse. Normally, this is divorce. Subsection (a) states an obvious proposition, but subsection (b) deals with the difficult problem of invalid divorce or annulment, which is particularly frequent as to foreign divorce decrees but may arise as to a local decree where there is some defect in jurisdiction; the basic principle underlying these provisions is estoppel against the surviving spouse. Where there is only a legal separation, rather than a divorce, succession patterns are not affected; but if the separation is accompanied by a complete property settlement, this may operate under Section 2-204 as a renunciation of benefits under a prior will and by intestate succession.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended the addition, in the preliminary statement of subsection (b), of explicit reference to Section 3-203 which controls priorities for appointment as personal representative.

        Proof in a civil case, that a person is a “slayer” and, thus, barred by this statute from benefitting from his own action, need only be by a preponderance of the evidence. Hodge v. Waggoner, 164 Idaho 89, 425 P.3d 1232 (2018).

       <p>
        Claimant was given an opportunity to dispute whether he was a slayer, because decedent’s estate filed a detective’s affidavit, which stated that the claimant had confessed to shooting the decedent, and the claimant did not contest the veracity of the detective’s testimony or submit any controverting evidence.

       <p>
        Magistrate’s conclusion that the wound inflicted by wife must necessarily have been the “direct cause” of death for this section to apply was erroneous, and the fact that the gunshot wound was not the immediate cause of death was not controlling; a nonfatal wound is the legal cause of death if it started a chain of causation which led to death, and the one who inflicted such a wound has committed homicide.

       <p>
        Where the gunshot wound inflicted by decedent’s wife hastened the decedent’s death by weakening his physical condition and by interrupting his chemotherapy treatments, thus allowing preexisting cancer, which had been controlled, to rebound and rapidly grow, the gunshot wound was a substantial factor and a proximate cause of the death of decedent, and therefore this section applied to prevent wife from inheriting from decedent husband’s estate.

        A growing group of states have enacted statutes dealing with the problems covered by this section, and uniformity appears desirable. The section is confined to intentional and felonious homicide and excludes the accidental manslaughter killing.
       </p>
       <p>
        At first it may appear that the matter dealt with is criminal in nature and not a proper matter for probate courts. However, the concept that a wrongdoer may not profit by his own wrong is a civil concept, and the probate court is the proper forum to determine the effect of killing on succession to property of the decedent. There are numerous situations where the same conduct gives rise to both criminal and civil consequences. A killing may result in criminal prosecution for murder and civil litigation by the murdered person’s family under wrongful death statutes. While conviction in the criminal prosecution under this section is treated as conclusive on the matter of succession to the murdered person’s property, acquittal does not have the same consequences. This is because different considerations as well as a different burden of proof enter into the finding of guilty in the criminal prosecution. Hence it is possible that the defendant on a murder charge may be found not guilty and acquitted, but if the same person claims as an heir or devisee of the decedent, he may in the probate court be found to have feloniously and intentionally killed the decedent and thus be barred under this section from sharing in the estate. An analogy exists in the tax field, where a taxpayer may be acquitted of tax fraud in a criminal prosecution but found to have committed the fraud in a civil proceeding. In many of the cases arising under this section there may be no criminal prosecution because the murderer has committed suicide.

        Purpose and Scope of Revision.

       <p>
        <p class="">
    Purpose and Scope of Revision. The revisions of this section, pre-1990 Section 2-508, intend to unify the law of probate and nonprobate transfers. As originally promulgated, pre-1990 Section 2-508 revoked a predivorce devise to the testator’s former spouse. The revisions expand the section to cover “will substitutes” such as revocable inter-vivos trusts, life-insurance and retirement-plan beneficiary designations, transfer-on-death accounts, and other revocable dispositions to the former spouse that the divorced individual established before the divorce (or annulment). As revised, this section also effects a severance of the interests of the former spouses in property that they held at the time of the divorce (or annulment) as joint tenants with the right of survivorship; their co-ownership interests become tenancies in common.
       </p>
       <p>
        As revised, this section is the most comprehensive provision of its kind, but many states have enacted piecemeal legislation tending in the same direction. For example, Michigan and Ohio have statutes transforming spousal joint tenancies in land into tenancies in common upon the spouses’ divorce. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 552.102; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 5302.20(c)(5). Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee have recently enacted legislation effecting a revocation of provisions for the settlor’s former spouse in revocable inter-vivos trusts. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 1339.62; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 60, § 175; Tenn. Code Ann.<cite class="id_code">§ 35-50</cite>-5115 (applies to revocable and irrevocable inter-vivos trusts). Statutes in Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas relate to the consequence of divorce on life-insurance and retirement-plan beneficiary designations. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 552.101; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 1339.63; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, § 178; Tex. Fam. Code §§ 3.632-.633.
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts have also come under increasing pressure to use statutory construction techniques to extend statutes like the pre-1990 version of Section 2-508 to various will substitutes. In
    Clymer v. Mayo
    , 473 N.E.2d 1084 (Mass. 1985), the Massachusetts court held the statute applicable to a revocable inter-vivos trust, but restricted its “holding to the particular facts of this case - specifically the existence of a revocable pour-over trust funded entirely at the time of the decedent’s death.” 473 N.E.2d at 1093. The trust in that case was an unfunded life-insurance trust; the life insurance was employer-paid life insurance. In
    <i>
     Miller v. First Nat’l Bank &amp; Tr. Co.
    </i>
    , 637 P.2d 75 (Okla. 1981), the court also held such a statute to be applicable to an unfunded life-insurance trust. The testator’s will devised the residue of his estate to the trustee of the life-insurance trust. Despite the absence of meaningful evidence of intent to incorporate, the court held that the pour-over devise incorporated the life-insurance trust into the will by reference, and thus was able to apply the revocation-upon-divorce statute. In
    <i>
     Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Stitzel
    </i>
    , 1 Pa. Fiduc. 2d 316 (C.P. 1981), however, the court held a statute similar to the pre-1990 version of Section 2-508 to be inapplicable to effect a revocation of a life-insurance beneficiary designation of the former spouse.

    , 473 N.E.2d 1084 (Mass. 1985), and Estate of Coffed, 387 N.E.2d 1209 (N.Y. 1979), the result of treating the former spouse as if he or she predeceased the testator was that a gift in the governing instrument was triggered in favor of relatives of the former spouse who, after the divorce, were no longer relatives of the testator. In the Massachusetts case, the former spouse’s nieces and nephews ended up with an interest in the property. In the New York case, the winners included the former spouse’s child by a prior marriage. For other cases to the same effect,
        see Porter v. Porter
        , 286 N.W.2d 649 (Iowa 1979);
        Bloom v. Selfon
        , 555 A.2d 75 (Pa. 1989);
        Estate of Graef
        , 368 N.W.2d 633 (Wis. 1985). Given that, during divorce process or in the aftermath of the divorce, the former spouse’s relatives are likely to side with the former spouse, breaking down or weakening any former ties that may previously have developed between the transferor and the former spouse’s relatives, seldom would the transferor have favored such a result. This section, therefore, also revokes these gifts.

    Consequence of Revocation. The effect of revocation by this section is that the provisions of the governing instrument are given effect as if the divorced individual’s former spouse (and relatives of the former spouse) disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section (see Section 2-1106 for the effect of a disclaimer). Note that this means that the antilapse statute applies in appropriate cases in which the divorced individual or relative is treated as having disclaimed. In the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, the provisions of the governing instrument are given effect as if the former spouse and relatives of the former spouse died immediately before the divorce or annulment. If the divorced individual (or relative of the divorced individual) is the donee of an unexercised power of appointment that is revoked by this section, the gift-in-default clause, if any, is to take effect, to the extent that the gift-in-default clause is not itself revoked by this section.

        Federal Preemption of State Law.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Federal Preemption of State Law. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) federalizes pension and employee benefit law. Section 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), provides that the provisions of Titles I and IV of ERISA “shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan” governed by ERISA.
       </p>
       <p>
        ERISA’s preemption clause is extraordinarily broad. ERISA Section 514(a) does not merely preempt state laws that conflict with specific provisions in ERISA. Section 514(a) preempts “any and all State laws” insofar as they “relate to” any ERISA-governed employee benefit plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        A complex case law has arisen concerning the question of whether to apply ERISA Section 514(a) to preempt state law in circumstances in which ERISA supplies no substantive regulation. For example, until 1984, ERISA contained no authorization for the enforcement of state domestic relations decrees against pension accounts, but the federal courts were virtually unanimous in refusing to apply ERISA preemption against such state decrees.
    See, e.g., American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Merry
    , 592 F.2d 118 (2d Cir. 1979). The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 amended ERISA to add Sections 206(d)(3) and 514(b)(7), confirming the judicially created exception for state domestic relations decrees.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal courts have been less certain about whether to defer to state probate law. In
    Board of Trustees of Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. H.F. Johnson, Inc.
    , 830 F.2d 1009 (9th Cir. 1987), the court held that ERISA preempted the Montana nonclaim statute (which is Section 3-803 of the Uniform Probate Code). On the other hand, in
    <i>
     Mendez-Bellido v. Board of Trustees
    </i>
    , 709 F. Supp. 329 (E.D.N.Y. 1989), the court applied the New York “slayer-rule” against an ERISA preemption claim, reasoning that “state laws prohibiting murderers from receiving death benefits are relatively uniform [and therefore] there is little threat of creating a ‘patchwork scheme of regulations’” that ERISA sought to avoid.
    It is to be hoped that the federal courts will continue to show sensitivity to the primary role of state law in the field of probate and nonprobate transfers. To the extent that the federal courts think themselves unable to craft exceptions to ERISA’s preemption language, it is open to them to apply state law concepts as federal common law. Because the Uniform Probate Code contemplates multistate applicability, it is well suited to be the model for federal common law absorption.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another avenue of reconciliation between ERISA preemption and the primacy of state law in this field is envisioned in subsection (h)(2) of this section. It imposes a personal liability for pension payments that pass to a former spouse or relative of a former spouse. This provision respects ERISA’s concern that federal law govern the administration of the plan, while still preventing unjust enrichment that would result if an unintended beneficiary were to receive the pension benefits. Federal law has no interest in working a broader disruption of state probate and nonprobate transfer law than is required in the interest of smooth administration of pension and employee benefit plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regrettably, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in
    Hillman v. Maretta
    , 133 S.Ct. 1943 (2013), that a Virginia statute essentially equivalent to subsection (h)(2) of this section was pre-empted by the federal law known as FEGLIA (the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Act of 1954), 5 U.S.C. § 8701 et seq. FEGLIA provides that “[t]he provisions of any contract under [FEGLIA] which relate to the nature of extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any law of any State . . . which relates to group life insurance to the extent that the law or regulation is inconsistent with the contractual provisions.” 5 U.S.C. § 8709(d)(1). The Court’s decision in Hillman has many unfortunate consequences. First, the decision frustrates the dominant purpose of wealth transfer law, which is to implement the transferor’s intention. The result in Hillman, that the decedent’s ex-spouse remained entitled to the proceeds of the decedent’s life insurance policy purchased through a program established by FEGLIA, frustrates the decedent’s intention. Second, the Hillman decision ignores the decades-long trend of unifying the law governing probate and nonprobate transfers. The revocation-on-divorce rule has long been a part of probate law (
    <i>
     see, e.g.
    </i>
    , pre-1990 Section 2-508). In 1990, this section extended the rule of revocation on divorce to nonprobate transfers. Third, the decision in Hillman fosters a division between state- and federally-regulated nonprobate mechanisms. If the decedent in Hillman had purchased a life insurance policy individually, rather than through the FEGLIA program, the policy would have been governed by the Virginia counterpart of this section. For persuasive critiques of the Hillman decision,

     <p>
      The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, his separate property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates, and upon the death of a husband or wife, the decedent’s share of their community property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the surviving spouse, but all of their community property which is under the management and control of the decedent is subject to his debts and administration, and that portion of their community property which is not under the management and control of the decedent but which is necessary to carry out the provisions of his will is subject to administration; but the devolution of all the above described property is subject to rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, to renunciation to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse and to administration.

        The provisions of this Article [Chapter] describe the Flexible System of Administration of Decedents’ Estates. Designed to be applicable to both intestate and testate estates and to provide persons interested in decedents’ estates with as little or as much by way of procedural and adjudicative safeguards as may be suitable under varying circumstances, this system is the heart of the Uniform Probate Code.
    The organization and detail of the system here described may be expressed in varying ways and some states may see fit to reframe parts of this Article [Chapter] to better accommodate local institutions. Variations in language from state to state can be tolerated without loss of the essential purposes of procedural uniformity and flexibility, if the following essential characteristics are carefully protected in the redrafting process:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol11">
         Post-mortem probate of a will must occur to make a will effective and appointment of a personal representative by a public official after the decedent’s death is required in order to create the duties and powers attending the office of personal representative. Neither are compelled, however, but are left to be obtained by persons having an interest in the consequence of probate or appointment. Estates descend at death to successors identified by any probated will, or to heirs if no will is probated, subject to rights which may be implemented through administration.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol12">
         Two methods of securing probate of wills which include a non-adjudicative determination (informal probate) on the one hand, and a judicial determination after notice to all interested persons (formal probate) on the other, are provided.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol13">
         Two methods of securing appointment of a personal representative which include appointment without notice and without final adjudication of matters relevant to priority for appointment (informal appointment), on the one hand, and appointment by judicial order after notice to interested persons (formal appointment) on the other, are provided.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol14">
         A five day waiting period from death preventing informal probate or informal appointment of any but a special administrator is required.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol15">
         Probate of a will by informal or formal proceedings or an adjudication of intestacy may occur without any attendant requirement of appointment of a personal representative.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol16">
         One judicial, in rem, proceeding encompassing formal probate of any wills (or a determination after notice that the decedent left no will), appointment of a personal representative and complete settlement of an estate under continuing supervision of the Court (supervised administration) is provided for testators and persons interested in a decedent’s estate, whether testate or intestate, who desire to use it.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol17">
         Unless supervised administration is sought and ordered, persons interested in estates (including personal representatives, whether appointed informally or after notice) may use an “in and out” relationship to the Court so that any question or assumption relating to the estate, including the status of an estate as testate or intestate, matters relating to one or more claims, disputed titles, accounts of personal representatives, and distribution, may be resolved or established by adjudication after notice without necessarily subjecting the estate to the necessity of judicial orders in regard to other or further questions or assumptions.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol18">
         The status of a decedent in regard to whether he left a valid will or died intestate must be resolved by adjudication after notice in proceedings commenced within three years after his death. If not so resolved, any will probated informally becomes final, and if there is no such probate, the status of the decedent as intestate is finally determined, by a statute of limitations which bars probate and appointment unless requested within three years after death.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c03p01s15-3-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol19">
         Personal representatives appointed informally or after notice, and whether supervised or not, have statutory powers enabling them to collect, protect, sell, distribute and otherwise handle all steps in administration without further order of the Court, except that supervised personal representatives may be subjected to special restrictions on power as endorsed on their letters.
    (10) Purchasers from personal representatives and from distributees of personal representatives are protected so that adjudications regarding the testacy status of a decedent or any other question going to the propriety of a sale are not required in order to protect purchasers.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        (11) Provisions protecting a personal representative who distributes without adjudication are included to make nonadjudicated settlements feasible.
       </p>
       <p>
        (12) Statutes of limitation bar creditors of the decedent who fail to present claims within four months after legal advertising of the administration and unsecured claims not previously barred by non-claim statutes are barred after three years from the decedent’s death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, the system accepts the premise that the Court’s role in regard to probate and administration, and its relationship to personal representatives who derive their power from public appointment, is wholly passive until some interested person invokes its power to secure resolution of a matter. The state, through the Court, should provide remedies which are suitable and efficient to protect any and all rights regarding succession, but should refrain from intruding into family affairs unless relief is requested, and limit its relief to that sought.

       <p>
        The basic idea of this section follows Section 85 of the Model Probate Code. The exception referring to Section 3-1201 relates to affidavit procedures which are authorized for collection of estates worth less than $5,000 [$100,000 in Idaho].
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3-107 and various sections in Parts 3 and 4 of this Article [Chapter] make it clear that a will may be probated without appointment of a personal representative, including any nominated by the will.
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of probate stated here and the limitations on probate provided in section 3-108 mean that questions as to testacy may be eliminated simply by the running of time. Under these sections, an informally probated will cannot be questioned after the later of three years from the decedent’s death or one year from the probate whether or not an executor was appointed, or, if an executor was appointed, without regard to whether the estate has been distributed. If the decedent is believed to have died without a will, the running of three years from death bars probate of a late-discovered will and so makes the assumption of intestacy conclusive.
    The exceptions to the section (other than the exception relevant to small estates) are not intended to accommodate cases of late-discovered wills. Rather, they are designed to make the probate requirement inapplicable where circumstances led survivors of a decedent to believe that there was no point to probating a will of which they may have had knowledge. If any will was probated within three years of death, or if letters of administration were issued in this period, the exceptions to the section are inapplicable. If there has been no proceeding in probate, persons seeking to establish title by an unprobated will must show, with reference to the estate they claim, either that it has been possessed by those to whom it was devised or that it has been unknown to the decedent’s heirs or devisees and not possessed by any.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is to be noted, also, that devisees who are able to claim under one of the exceptions to this section may not obtain probate of the will or administration of the estate to assist them in their efforts to obtain the estate in question. The exceptions are to a rule which bars admission of a will into evidence, rather than to the section barring late probate and late appointment of personal representatives. Still, the exceptions should serve to prevent two “hard” cases which can be imagined readily. In one, a surviving spouse fails to seek probate of a will, giving her the entire estate of the decedent because she is informed or believes that all of her husband’s property was held by them jointly, with right of survivorship. Later, it is discovered that she was mistaken as to the nature of her husband’s title. The other case involves a devisee who sees no point to securing probate of a will in his favor because he is unaware of any estate. Subsequently, valuable rights of the decedent are discovered.

       This and sections of Part 8, Article III [Chapter 3], are designed to force creditors of decedents to assert their claims against duly appointed personal representatives. Creditors of a decedent are interested persons who may seek the appointment of a personal representative (Section 3-301). If no appointment is granted to another within 45 days after the decedent’s death, a creditor may be eligible to be appointed if other persons with priority decline to serve or are ineligible (Section 3-203). But, if a personal representative has been appointed and has closed the estate under circumstances which leave a creditor’s claim unbarred, the creditor is permitted to enforce his claims against distributees, as well as against the personal representative if any duty owed to creditors under 3-807 or 3-1003 has been breached. The methods for closing estates are outlined in Sections 3-1001 through 3-1003. Termination of appointment under Section 3-608 et seq. may occur though the estate is not closed and so may be irrelevant to the question of whether creditors may pursue distributees.

      Persons interested in decedents’ estates may apply to the registrar for determination in the informal proceedings provided in this chapter, and may petition the court for orders in formal proceedings within the court’s jurisdiction including but not limited to those described in this chapter. The court has exclusive jurisdiction of formal proceedings to determine how decedents’ estates subject to the laws of this state are to be administered, expended and distributed.

        Jury’s determination of damages in favor of a beneficiary, in his action for breach of a contract made by a husband and wife for disposition of a survivor’s estate, was reversed; trial court and the parties mistakenly believed that the contract establishing the survivor’s estate contained provisions relating to the determination of the beneficiary’s entitlement, and because there was confusion regarding what expenses, particularly attorney fees, could be deducted from his share, the judge handling the probate was best positioned to determine the net share of any estate beneficiary.

       This and other sections of Article III [Chapter 3] contemplate a non-judicial officer who will act on informal application and a judge who will hear and decide formal petitions. See Section 1-307 which permits the judge to perform or delegate the functions of the Registrar.
    However, the primary purpose of Article III [Chapter 3] is to describe functions to be performed by various public officials, rather than to prescribe how these responsibilities should be assigned within a given state or county.
    Hence, any of several alternatives to the organizational scheme assumed for purposes of this draft would be acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a state might assign responsibility for maintenance of probate files and records, and for receiving and acting upon informal applications, to existing, limited power probate offices. Responsibility for hearing and deciding formal petitions would then be assigned to the court of general jurisdiction of each county or district.
      </p>
      <p>
       If separate courts or offices are not feasible, it may be preferable to concentrate authority for allocating responsibility respecting formal and informal proceedings in the judge. To do so helps fix responsibility for the total operation of the office. This is the assumption of this draft.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be up to each adopting state to select the organizational arrangement which best meets its needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the office with jurisdiction to hear and decide formal petitions is the county or district court of general jurisdiction, there will be little basis for objection to the broad statement of concurrent jurisdiction of this section. However, if a more specialized “estates” court is used, there may be pressure to prevent it from hearing negligence and other actions involving jury trials, even though it may be given unlimited power to decide other cases to which a personal representative is a party. A system for certifying matters involving jury trials to the general trial court could be provided, although the alternative of permitting the estates court to empanel juries where necessary might not be unworkable. In any event, the jurisdiction of the “estates” or “probate” Court in regard to negligence litigation would only be concurrent with that of the general trial court. The important point is that the estates court, whatever it is called, should have unlimited power to hear and finally dispose of all matters relevant to determination of the extent of the decedent’s estate and of the claims against it. The jury trial question is peripheral.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the comment to the next section regarding adjustments which might be made in the Code by a state with a single court of general jurisdiction for each county or district.

        The Uniform Probate Code as proposed in section 15-3-105 contained an additional sentence which read: “The court has concurrent jurisdiction of any other action or proceeding concerning a succession or to which an estate, through a personal representative, may be a party, including actions to determine title to property, alleged to belong to the estate, and if any action or proceeding in which property distributed by a personal representative or its value is sought to be subjected to rights of creditors or successors of the decedent.” This provision was stated in the Official Comments to be inappropriate where probate matters are assigned to a branch of a single court of general jurisdiction. The above section is a version suggested in the Comments to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c01s3-106" target="_blank">§ 3-106 </a></cite>to cover this matter in such cases.

        Trial court and the parties mistakenly believed that the contract establishing the survivor’s estate contained provisions relating to the determination of the beneficiary’s entitlement, and because there was confusion regarding what expenses, particularly attorney fees, could be deducted from his share, the judge handling the probate was best positioned to determine the net share of any estate beneficiary, considering all expenses, the overall scheme of distribution, and the effect of one beneficiary’s entitlement upon that of the others; by following the intent of the applicable statutes and rules pertaining to assignment of probate proceedings to the magistrate division, confusion could be averted or alleviated.

      <p>
       This section and others in Article III [Chapter 3] describe a system of administration of decedents’ estates which gives interested persons control of whether matters relating to estates will become occasions for judicial orders. Sections 3-501 through 3-505 describe supervised administration, a judicial proceeding which is continuous throughout administration. It corresponds with the theory of administration of decedents’ estates which prevails in many states. See, section 62, Model Probate Code. If supervised administration is not requested, persons interested in an estate may use combinations of the formal proceedings (order by judge after notice to persons concerned with the relief sought), informal proceedings (request for the limited response that non-judicial personnel of the probate court are authorized to make in response to verified application) and filings provided in the remaining Parts of Article III [Chapter 3] to secure authority and protection needed to administer the estate. Nothing except self-interest will compel resort to the judge. When resort to the judge is necessary or desirable to resolve a dispute or to gain protection, the scope of the proceeding if not otherwise prescribed by the Code is framed by the petition. The securing of necessary jurisdiction over interested persons in a formal proceeding is facilitated by Sections 3-106 and 3-602. Section 3-201 locates venue for all proceedings at the place where the first proceeding occurred.

        This section establishes a basic limitation period of three years within which it may be determined whether a decedent left a will and to commence administration of his estate. But, an exception assures that heirs will have at least one year after an informal probate to initiate a contest and to secure administration of the estate as intestate.
       </p>
       <p>
        If no will is probated within three years from death, the section has the effect of making the assumption of intestacy final. If a will has been informally probated within the period, the section has the effect of making the informal probate conclusive after three years or within twelve months from informal probate, if later. Heirs or devisees can protect themselves against change within the three years of assumption concerning whether the decedent left a will or died intestate by bringing a formal proceeding shortening the period to that described in Sections 3-412 and 3-413.
       </p>
       <p>
        A personal representative who has been appointed under an assumption concerning testacy which may be reversed in the three-year period if there has been no formal proceeding, is protected by Section 3-703. It relieves a personal representative of liability for surcharge for certain distributions made pursuant to an informally probated will, or under authority of informally issued letters of administration. Distributees who receive an estate distributed before the three-year period expires where there has been no formal determination accelerating the time for certainty, remain potentially liable to persons determined to be entitled by formal proceedings instituted within the basic period under Sections 3-909 and 3-1006.
    Purchasers from personal representatives and distributees may be protected without regard to whether the three-year period has run. See Sections 3-715 and 3-910.
       </p>
       <p>
        All creditors’ claims are barred after three years from death. See Section 3-803(a)(2). Because of this, and since any possibility that letters may be issued at any time would be seen as a “cloud” on the title of heirs or devisees otherwise secure under 3-101, the three year statute of limitations applies to bar appointment of a personal representative after the basic period has passed. Section 83 of the Model Probate Code barred probate and administration after five years, and other statutes imposing time limits on these proceedings are cited at pp. 307-310 of the Model Probate Code. A qualification covers the situation where a closed administration is sought to be re-opened to administer after discovered assets. See Section 3-1008. If there has been no probate or appointment within three years, and if either exception to Section 3-102 applies, devisees under a late-discovered will may use a will to establish their title. But, they may not secure probate of the will, nor may they obtain appointment of a personal representative. The same pattern applies to heirs who, in a case where there has been no administration discover assets after the three year period has run. Such persons will not be able to protect purchasers with the ease of those interested in an estate where a personal representative has been appointed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The basic premise underlying all of these time provisions is that interested persons who want to assume the risks implicit in the three-year period of limitations should be provided legitimate means by which they can do so. At the same time, parties should be afforded ample opportunity for earlier protection if they want it.

       Sections 1-303 and 3-201 cover the subject of venue for estate proceedings. Sections 3-202, 3-301, 3-303 and 3-309 also may be relevant.
    Provisions for transfer of venue appear in Section 1-303.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interplay of these several sections may be illustrated best by examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 1. A formal probate or appointment proceeding is initiated in A County. Interested persons who believe that venue is in B County rather than A County must raise their question about venue in A County, because 1-303 gives the Court in which the proceeding is first commenced authority to resolve disputes over venue. If the Court in A County erroneously determines that it has venue, the remedy is by appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 2. An informal probate or appointment application is filed and granted without notice in A County. If interested persons wish to challenge the registrar’s determination of venue, they may not simply file a formal proceeding in the county of their choice and thus force the proponent in the prior proceeding to debate the question of venue in their county. 3-201(b) locates the venue of any subsequent proceeding where the first proceeding occurred. The function of subsection (b) is obvious when one thinks of subsequent proceedings as those which relate to claims or accounts, or to efforts to control a personal representative. It is less obvious when it seems to locate the forum for squabbles over venue at the place accepting the first informal application. Still, the applicant seeking an informal order must be careful about the statements he makes in his application because he may be charged with perjury under Section 1-310 if he is deliberately inaccurate. Moreover, the registrar must be satisfied that the allegations in the application support a finding of venue. Section 3-201(c) provides a remedy for one who is upset about the venue-locating impact of a prior order in an informal proceeding and who does not wish to engage in full litigation about venue in the forum chosen by the other interested person unless he is forced to do so. Using it, he may succeed in getting the A County Court to transfer the proceedings to the county of his choice. He would be well advised to initiate formal proceedings if he gets the chance, for if he relies on informal proceedings, he, too, may be “bumped” if the judge in B County agrees with some movant that venue was not in B County.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 3. If the decedent’s domicile was not in the state, venue is proper under Sections 3-201 and 1-303 in any county where he had assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       One contemplating starting administration because of the presence of local assets should have several other sections of the Code in mind. First, by use of the recognition provisions in Article IV [Chapter 4], it may be possible to avoid administration in any state other than that in which the decedent was domiciled. Second, Section 3-203 may apply to give priority for local appointment to the representative appointed at domicile. Third, under Section 3-309, informal appointment proceedings in this state will be dismissed if it is known that a personal representative has been previously appointed at domicile.

        This section is designed to reduce the possibility that conflicting findings of domicile in two or more states may result in inconsistent administration and distribution of parts of the same estate. Section 3-408 dealing with the effect of adjudications in other states concerning testacy supports the same general purpose to use domiciliary law to unify succession of property located in different states.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether testate or intestate, succession should follow the presumed wishes of the decedent whenever possible. Unless a decedent leaves a separate will for the portion of his estate located in each different state, it is highly unlikely that he would want different portions of his estate subject to different rules simply because courts reach conflicting conclusions concerning his domicile. It is pointless to debate whether he would prefer one or the other of the conflicting rules, when the paramount inference is that the decedent would prefer that his estate be unified under either rule rather than wasted in litigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The section adds very little to existing law. If a previous estate proceeding in State A has determined that the decedent was a domiciliary of A, persons who were personally before the court in A would be precluded by the principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel (and full faith and credit) from relitigating the issue of domicile in a later proceeding in State B. Probably, it would not matter in this setting that domicile was a jurisdictional fact. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165, 59 S. Ct. 134, 83 L. Ed. 104 (1938). Even if the parties to a present proceeding were not personally before the Court in an earlier proceeding in State A involving the same decedent, the prior judgment would be binding as to property subject to the power of the courts in A, on persons to whom due notice of the proceeding was given. Riley v. New York Trust Co., 315 U.S. 343, 62 S. Ct. 608, 86 L. Ed. 885 (1942); Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank and Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950).
    Where a court learns that parties before it are also parties to previously initiated litigation involving a common question, traditional judicial reluctance to deciding unnecessary questions, as well as considerations of comity, are likely to lead it to delay the local proceedings to await the result in the other court. A somewhat more troublesome question is involved when one of the parties before the local court manifests a determination not to appear personally in the prior initiated proceedings so that he can preserve his ability to litigate contested points in a more friendly, or convenient, forum. But, the need to preserve all possible advantages available to particular litigants should be subordinated to the decedent’s probable wish that his estate not be wasted in unnecessary litigation. Thus, the section requires that the local claimant either initiate litigation in the forum of his choice before litigation is started somewhere else, or accept the necessity of contesting unwanted views concerning the decedent’s domicile offered in litigation pending elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is to be noted, in this connection, that the local suitor always will have a chance to contest the question of domicile in the other state. His locally initiated proceedings may proceed to a valid judgment accepting his theory of the case unless parties who would oppose him appear and defend on the theory that the domicile question is currently being litigated elsewhere. If the litigation in the other state has proceeded to judgment, Section 3-408 rather than the instant section will govern. If this section applies, it will mean that the foreign proceedings are still pending, so that the local person’s contention concerning domicile can be made therein even though until the defense of litigation elsewhere is offered in the local proceedings, he may not have been notified of the foreign proceeding.

       The priorities applicable to informal proceedings are applicable to formal proceedings. However, if the proceedings are formal, a person with a substantial interest may object to the selection of one having priority other than because of will provisions. The provision for majority approval which is triggered by such a protest can be handled in a formal proceeding since all interested persons will be before the court, and a judge capable of handling discretionary matters, will be involved.
    In considering this section as it relates to a devise to a trustee for various beneficiaries, it is to be noted that “interested persons” is defined by 1-201(20) [(25)] to include fiduciaries. Also, 1-403(2) [15-1-403(b)] and 3-912 show a purpose to make trustees serve as representatives of all beneficiaries. The provision in subsection (d) is consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a state’s statutes recognize a public administrator or public trustee as the appropriate agency to seek administration of estates in which the state may have an interest, it would be appropriate to indicate in this section the circumstances under which such an officer may seek administration. If no officer is recognized locally, the state could claim as heir by virtue of Section 2-105.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (g) was inserted in connection with the decision to abandon the effort to describe ancillary administration in Article IV [Chapter 4]. Other provisions in Article III [Chapter 3] which are relevant to administration of assets in a state other than that of the decedent’s domicile are Section 1-301 (territorial effect), Section 3-201 (venue), Section 3-308 (informal appointment for non-resident decedent delayed 30 days), Section 3-309 (no informal appointment here if a representative has been appointed at domicile), Section 3-815 (duty of personal representative where administration is more than one state) and Sections 4-201 — 4-205 (local recognition of foreign personal representatives).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person desiring notice of any order or filing pertaining to a decedent’s estate in which he has a financial or property interest, may file a demand for notice with the court at any time after the death of the decedent stating the name of the decedent, the nature of his interest in the estate, and the demandant’s address or that of his attorney. The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the personal representative if one has been appointed. After filing of a demand, no order or filing to which the demand relates shall be made or accepted without notice as prescribed in section 15-1-401[, Idaho Code,] of this code to the demandant or his attorney. The validity of an order which is issued or filing which is accepted without compliance with this requirement shall not be affected by the error, but the petitioner receiving the order or the person making the filing may be liable for any damage caused by the absence of notice. The requirement of notice arising from a demand under this provision may be waived in writing by the demandant and shall cease upon the termination of his interest in the estate.

       Forcing one who seeks informal probate or informal appointment to make oath before a public official concerning the details required of applications should deter persons who might otherwise misuse the no-notice feature of informal proceedings. The application is available as a part of the public record. If deliberately false representation is made, remedies for fraud will be available to injured persons without specified time limit (see Article I [Chapter 1]). The section is believed to provide important safeguards that may extend well beyond those presently available under supervised administration for persons damaged by deliberate wrongdoing.

       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended the addition of subsection (b) [(g)] to reflect an improvement accomplished in the first enactment in Idaho. The addition, which is a form of long-arm provision that affects everyone who acts as an applicant in informal proceedings, in conjunction with Section 1-106 provides a remedy in the Court against anyone who might make known misstatements in an application. The addition is not needed in the case of an applicant who becomes a personal representative as a result of his application for the implied consent provided in Section 3-602 would cover the matter. Also, the requirement that the applicant state that time limits on informal probate and appointment have not run, formerly appearing as (iv) [(4)] under paragraph (2) [(b)] was expanded to refer to informal appointment and moved into (1) [(a)]. Correcting an oversight in the original text, this change coordinates the statements required in an application with the limitations provisions of Section 3-108.

     <p>
      Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will or informal statement of intestacy, the registrar, upon making the findings required by section 15-3-303[, Idaho Code,] of this chapter shall issue a written statement of informal probate if at least five (5) days have elapsed since the decedent’s death. Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding. No defect in the application or procedure relating thereto which leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.

       Model Probate Code Sections 68 and 70 contemplate probate by judicial order as the only method of validating a will. This “umbrella” section and the sections it refers to describe an alternative procedure called “informal probate.” It is a statement of probate by the Registrar. A succeeding section describes cases in which informal probate is to be denied. “Informal probate” is subjected to safeguards which seem appropriate to a transaction which has the effect of making a will operative and which may be the only official reaction concerning its validity. “Informal probate,” it is hoped, will serve to keep the simple will which generates no controversy from becoming involved in truly judicial proceedings. The procedure is very much like “probate in common form” as it is known in England and some states.

       The purpose of this section is to permit informal probate of a will which, from a simple attestation clause, appears to have been executed properly. It is not necessary that the will be notarized as is the case with “pre-proved” wills in some states. If a will is “pre-proved” as provided in Article II [Chapter 2], it will, of course, “appear” to be well executed and include the recital necessary for easy probate here. If the instrument does not contain a proper recital by attesting witnesses, it may be probated informally on the strength of an affidavit by a person who can say what occurred at the time of execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except where probate or its equivalent has occurred previously in another state, informal probate is available only where an original will exists and is available to be filed. Lost or destroyed wills must be established in formal proceedings. See Section 3-402. Under Section 3-401, pendency of formal probate proceedings blocks informal probate or appointment proceedings.

       Sections 3-614 and 3-615 make it clear that a special administrator may be appointed to conserve the estate during any period of delay in probate of a will. Even though the will has not been approved, Section 3-614 gives priority for appointment as special administrator to the person nominated by the will which has been offered for probate. Section 3-203 governs priorities for appointment. Under it, one or more of the same class may receive priority through agreement of the others.
    The last sentence of the section is designed to prevent informal appointment of a personal representative in this state when a personal representative has been previously appointed at the decedent’s domicile. Sections 4-204 and 4-205 may make local appointment unnecessary. Appointment in formal proceedings is possible, however.

      § 15-3-401. Formal testacy proceedings — Nature — When commenced.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will. A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a petition as described in subsection (a) of section 15-3-402[, Idaho Code,] of this Part in which he requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application, or to set aside a determination that the entire estate is community and there is a surviving spouse, or a petition in accordance with subsection (c) of section 15-3-402[, Idaho Code,] of this Part for an order that the decedent died intestate.
     </p>
     <p>
      A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated. A formal testacy proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the registrar shall not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from exercising his power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding. A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the powers of his office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.

      <p>
       The word “testacy” is used to refer to the general status of a decedent in regard to wills. Thus, it embraces the possibility that he left no will, any question of which of several instruments is his valid will, and the possibility that he died intestate as to a part of his estate, and testate as to the balance. See Section 1-201 (44) [§ 15-1-201(52)].
      </p>
      <p>
       The formal proceedings described by this section may be: (i) an original proceeding to secure “solemn form” probate of a will; (ii) a proceeding to secure “solemn form” probate to corroborate a previous informal probate; (iii) a proceeding to block a pending application for informal probate, or to prevent an informal application from occurring thereafter; (iv) a proceeding to contradict a previous order of informal probate; (v) a proceeding to secure a declaratory judgment of intestacy and a determination of heirs in a case where no will has been offered. If a pending informal application for probate is blocked by a formal proceeding, the applicant may withdraw his application and avoid the obligation of going forward with prima facie proof of due execution. See Section 3-407. The petitioner in the formal proceedings may be content to let matters stop there, or he can frame his petition, or amend, so that he may secure an adjudication of intestacy which would prevent further activity concerning the will.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a personal representative has been appointed prior to the commencement of a formal testacy proceeding, the petitioner must request confirmation of the appointment to indicate that he does not want the testacy proceeding to have any effect on the duties of the personal representative, or refrain from seeking confirmation, in which case, the proceeding suspends the distributive power of the previously appointed representative. If nothing else is requested or decided in respect to the personal representative, his distributive powers are restored at the completion of the proceeding, with Section 3-703 directing him to abide by the will. “Distribute” and “distribution” do not include payment of claims. See Sections 1-201(10) [§ 15-1-201(12)], 3-807 and 3-902.

       If a petitioner seeks an adjudication that a decedent died intestate, he is required also to obtain a finding of heirship. A formal proceeding which is to be effective on all interested persons must follow reasonable notice to such persons. It seems desirable to force the proceedings through a formal determination of heirship because the finding will bolster the order, as well as preclude later questions that might arise at the time of the distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless an order of supervised administration is sought, there will be little occasion for a formal order concerning appointment of a personal representative which does not also adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent. If a formal order of appointment is sought because of disagreement over who should serve, Section 3-414 describes the appropriate procedure.

        Testacy proceedings involve adjudications that no will exists. Unknown wills as well as any which are brought to the attention of the Court are affected. Persons with potential interests under unknown wills have the notice afforded by death and by publication. Notice requirements extend also to persons named in a will that is known to the petitioners to exist, irrespective of whether it has been probated or offered for formal or informal probate, if their position may be affected adversely by granting of the petition. But, a rigid statutory requirement relating to such persons might cause undue difficulty. Hence, the statute merely provides that the petitioner may notify other persons.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would not be inconsistent with this section for the Court to adopt rules designed to make petitioners exercise reasonable diligence in searching for as yet undiscovered wills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3-106 provides that an order is valid as to those given notice, though less than all interested persons were given notice. Section 3-1001(b) provides a means of extending a testacy order to previously unnotified persons in connection with a formal closing.

       Model Probate Code section 72 requires a contestant to file written objections to any will he would oppose. The provision prevents potential confusion as to who must file what pleading that can arise from the notion that the probate of a will is in rem. The petition for probate of a revoking will is sufficient warning to proponents of the revoked will.

      If a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may order probate or intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of section 15-3-409[, Idaho Code,] of this Part have been met, or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support the order sought. If evidence concerning execution of the will is necessary, the affidavit or testimony of one (1) of any attesting witnesses to the instrument is sufficient. If the affidavit or testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution of the will may be proved by other evidence or affidavit.

       For various reasons, attorneys handling estates may want interested persons to be gathered for a hearing before the Court on the formal allowance of the will. The Court is not required to conduct a hearing, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       If no hearing is required, uncontested formal probates can be completed on the strength of the pleadings. There is no good reason for summoning attestors when no interested person wants to force the production of evidence on a formal probate. Moreover, there seems to be no valid distinction between litigation to establish a will, and other civil litigation, in respect to whether the court may enter judgment on the pleadings.

       Model Probate Code section 76, combined with section 77, substantially unchanged. The self-proved will is described in Article II [Chapter 2]. See Section 2-504. The “conclusive presumption” described here would foreclose questions such as whether the witnesses signed in the presence of the testator. It would not preclude proof of undue influence, lack of testamentary capacity, revocation or any relevant proof that the testator was unaware of the contents of the document. The balance of the section is derived from Model Probate Code sections 76 and 77.

     <p>
      In contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship. Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases, and, if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue. Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake or revocation. Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof. If a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it shall be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.

        Where a contest is filed in opposition to the probating of a will and both the petition to probate and the opposition are tried at the same time, and at the hearing proof is offered by the proponent of the will showing a due execution thereof, the burden of proof is then upon the contestant to meet, overturn, and disprove the prima facie case made by the proponent.

        The contestant of a will that has been admitted to probate has the burden of showing undue influence and that burden never shifts to the proponent of a will. Swaringen v. Swanstrom, 67 Idaho 245, 175 P.2d 692 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action to contest a will already admitted to probate, the defendants are not required to establish necessary facts to admit will to probate since burden of proof is on contestants to proceed and to sustain the burden of proof. In re Lunders’ Estate, 74 Idaho 448, 263 P.2d 1002 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestants of a will on the basis of incompetency of the testatrix are the plaintiffs in such a case and, as such, must sustain the burden of proof of their affirmative claim. In re Goan’s Estate, 83 Idaho 568, 366 P.2d 831 (1961).
    Where contention was that the testatrix was incompetent at the time she executed her will, an inference, arising from testatrix’ illness of high blood pressure and age of 81 years and from the fact that subsequent to the execution of her will she was less alert, that she was incompetent at the time of the execution of the will was insufficient to sustain the burden of the proof or the verdict.

      A final order of a court of another state determining testacy, [or] the validity or construction of a will, made in a proceeding involving notice to and an opportunity for contest by all interested persons must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this state if it includes, or is based upon, a finding that the decedent was domiciled at his death in the state where the order was made.

       This section is designed to extend the effect of final orders of another jurisdiction of the United States. It should not be read to restrict the obligation of the local court to respect the judgment of another court when parties who were personally before the other court also are personally before the local court. An “authenticated copy” includes copies properly certified under the full faith and credit statute. If conflicting claims of domicile are made in proceedings which are commenced in different jurisdictions, Section 3-202 applies. This section is framed to apply where a formal proceeding elsewhere has been previously concluded. Hence, if a local proceeding is concluded before formal proceedings at domicile are concluded, local law will control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Informal proceedings by which a will is probated or a personal representative is appointed are not proceedings which must be respected by a local court under either Section 3-202 or this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this section bears on questions of what assets are included in a decedent’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section adds nothing to existing law as applied to cases where the parties before the local court were also personally before the foreign court, or where the property involved was subject to the power of the foreign court. It extends present law so that, for some purposes, the law of another state may become binding in regard to due execution or revocation of wills controlling local land, and to questions concerning the meaning of ambiguous words in wills involving local land. But, choice of law rules frequently produce a similar result. See § 240 Restatement of the Law, Second: Conflict of Laws, p. 73, Proposed Official Draft III, 1969.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section may be easier to justify than familiar choice of law rules, for its application is limited to instances where the protesting party has had notice of, and an opportunity to participate in, previous litigation resolving the question he now seeks to raise.

     <p>
      After the time required for any notice has expired, upon proof of notice, and after any hearing that may be necessary, if the court finds that the testator is dead, venue is proper and that the proceeding was commenced within the limitation prescribed by section 15-3-108[, Idaho Code,] of this code, it shall determine the decedent’s domicile at death, his heirs and his state of testacy. Any will found to be valid and unrevoked shall be formally probated. Termination of any previous informal appointment of a personal representative, which may be appropriate in view of the relief requested and findings, is governed by section 15-3-612[, Idaho Code,] of this code. The petition shall be dismissed or appropriate amendment allowed if the court is not satisfied that the alleged decedent is dead. A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death, may be proved for probate in this state by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy introduced is a true copy and that the will has become effective under the law of the other place. When a lost will is established, the provisions thereof must be found by the court and the findings filed and recorded as other wills are filed and recorded.

        Contents of lost will can be proved only in two ways — first by a proven copy, second by someone who has read, or heard read, the original. Subscribing witness who never read, or heard read, the will cannot prove the will by reading a copy identified by a third person who wrote it, and then testifying that copy contained the contents of the will. Hull v. Cartin, 61 Idaho 578, 105 P.2d 196 (1940).
    While an alleged carbon or duplicate copy of a lost will may be the best evidence of the contents of the will, that does not make such copy the “best evidence” or even admissible on examination of a witness as to the provisions of the will, unless such witness personally knows it is a carbon or duplicate copy of the alleged lost will.

       </p>
       <p>
        The declarations of a testator after the due execution of a will may be admitted to show the will was lost or unavoidably destroyed or stolen against the wish of the testator during his lifetime, and such evidence may rebut the legal presumption that a will has been destroyed animo revocandi. Hull v. Cartin, 61 Idaho 578, 105 P.2d 196 (1940).

       <p>
        Evidence consisting of a copy of the will, testimony of the attorney who drafted and typed the will, and testimony of witnesses who were informed by the testator as to part of the contents of the will were insufficient to prove a lost will. Hull v. Cartin, 61 Idaho 578, 105 P.2d 196 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to probate a lost will, a carbon copy of the will proven by the one witness thereto did not constitute original evidence or a duplicate original of the will where the copy was never executed by being signed and witnessed. Hull v. Cartin, 61 Idaho 578, 105 P.2d 196 (1940).

        Except as otherwise provided in Section 3-412, an order in a formal testacy proceeding serves to end the time within which it is possible to probate after-discovered wills or to give effect to late-discovered facts concerning heirship. Determination of heirs is not barred by the three year limitation but a judicial determination of heirs is conclusive unless the order may be vacated.

       <p>
        This section authorizes a court to engage in some construction of wills incident to determining whether a will is entitled to probate. It seems desirable to leave the extent of this power to the sound discretion of the court. If wills are not construed in connection with a judicial probate, they may be subject to construction at any time. See Section 3-108.

       The provisions barring proof of late-discovered wills is derived in part from section 81 of Model Probate Code. The same section is the source of the provisions of (5) above. The provisions permitting vacation of an order determining heirs on certain conditions reflect the effort to offer parallel possibilities for adjudications in testate and intestate estates. See Section 3-401. An objective is to make it possible to handle an intestate estate exactly as a testate estate may be handled. If this is achieved, some of the pressure on persons to make wills may be relieved.
    If an alleged decedent turns out to have been alive, heirs and distributees are liable to restore the “estate or its proceeds.” If neither can be identified through the normal process of tracing assets, their liability depends upon the circumstances. The liability of distributees to claimants whose claims have not been barred, or to persons shown to be entitled to distribution when a formal proceeding changes a previous assumption informally established which guided an earlier distribution, is different. See Sections 3-909 and 3-1004.

       A petition raising a controversy concerning the priority or qualifications of a personal representative may be combined with a petition in a formal testacy proceeding. However, it is not necessary to petition formally for the appointment of a personal representative as a part of a formal testacy proceeding. A personal representative may be appointed on informal application either before or after formal proceedings which establish whether the decedent died testate or intestate or no appointment may be desired. See Sections 3-107, 3-301(a)(3) [§ 15-3-301(c)] and 3-307. Furthermore, procedures for securing the appointment of a new personal representative after a previous assumption as to testacy has been changed are provided by Section 3-612. These may be informal, or related to pending formal proceedings concerning testacy. A formal order relating to appointment may be desired when there is a dispute concerning priority or qualification to serve but no dispute concerning testacy. It is important to distinguish formal proceedings concerning appointment from “supervised administration.” The former includes any proceeding after notice involving a request for an appointment. The latter originates in a “formal proceeding” and may be requested in addition to a ruling concerning testacy or priority or qualifications of a personal representative, but is descriptive of a special proceeding with a different scope and purpose than those concerned merely with establishing the bases for an administration. In other words, a personal representative appointed in a “formal” proceeding may or may not be “supervised.”
    Another point should be noted. The Court may not immediately issue letters even though a formal proceeding seeking appointment is involved and results in an order authorizing appointment. Rather, Section 3-601 et seq. control the subject of qualification. Section 1-305 deals with letters.

      Supervised administration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent’s estate under the continuing authority of the court which extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative or other order terminating the proceeding. A supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in this Part, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.

       This and the following sections of this Part describe an optional procedure for settling an estate in one continuous proceeding in the Court. The proceeding is characterized as “in rem” to align it with the concepts described by the Model Probate Code. See Section 62, M.P.C. In cases where supervised administration is not requested or ordered, no compulsion other than self-interest exists to compel use of a formal testacy proceeding to secure an adjudication of a will or no will, because informal probate or appointment of an administrator in intestacy may be used. Similarly, unless administration is supervised, there is no compulsion other than self-interest to use a formal closing proceeding. Thus, even though an estate administration may be begun by use of a
    formal
    testacy proceeding which may involve an order concerning who is to be appointed personal representative, the proceeding is over when the order concerning testacy and appointment is entered. See Section 3-107. Supervised administration, therefore, is appropriate when an interested person desires assurance that the essential steps regarding opening and closing of an estate will be adjudicated. See the Comment following the next section.

     <p>
      A petition for supervised administration may be filed by any interested person or by a personal representative at any time or the prayer for supervised administration may be joined with a petition in a testacy or appointment proceeding. If the testacy of the decedent and the priority and qualification of any personal representative have not been adjudicated previously, the petition for supervised administration shall include the matters required of a petition in a formal testacy proceeding and the notice requirements and procedures applicable to a formal testacy proceeding apply. If not previously adjudicated, the court shall adjudicate the testacy of the decedent and questions relating to the priority and qualifications of the personal representative in any case involving a request for supervised administration, even though the request for supervised administration may be denied. After notice to interested persons, the court shall order supervised administration of a decedent’s estate: (1) if the decedent’s will directs supervised administration, it shall be ordered unless the court finds that circumstances bearing on the need for supervised administration have changed since the execution of the will and that there is no necessity for supervised administration; (2) if the decedent’s will directs unsupervised administration, supervised administration shall be ordered only upon a finding that it is necessary for protection of persons interested in the estate; or (3) in other cases if the court finds that supervised administration is necessary under the circumstances.

       The expressed wishes of a testator regarding supervised administration should bear upon, but not control, the question of whether supervised administration will be ordered. This section is designed to achieve a fair balance between the wishes of the decedent, and the interests of successors in regard to supervised administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since supervised administration normally will result in an adjudicated distribution of the estate, the issue of will or no will must be adjudicated. This section achieves this by forcing a petition for supervised administration to include matters necessary to put the issue of testacy before the Court. It is possible, however, that supervised administration will be requested because administrative complexities warranting it develop after the issue of will or no will has been resolved in a previously concluded formal testacy proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that supervised administration, though it compels a judicial settlement of an estate, is not the only route to obtaining judicial review and settlement at the close of an administration. The procedures described in Sections 3-1101 and 3-1102 are available for use by or against personal representatives who are not supervised. Also efficient remedies for breach of duty by a personal representative who is not supervised are available under Part 6 of this Article [Chapter]. Finally, each personal representative consents to jurisdiction of the Court as invoked by mailed notice of any proceeding relating to the estate which may be initiated by an interested person. Also, persons interested in the estate may be subjected to orders of the Court following mailed notices made in proceedings initiated by the personal representative. In combination, these possibilities mean that supervised administration will be valuable principally to persons who see some advantage in a single judicial proceeding which will produce adjudications on all major points involved in an estate settlement.

       The duties and powers of personal representative are described in Part 7 of this Article [Chapter]. The ability of a personal representative to create a good title in a purchaser of estate assets is not hampered by the fact that the personal representative may breach a duty created by statute, court order or other circumstances in making the sale. See Section 3-715. However, formal proceedings against a personal representative may involve requests for qualification of the power normally possessed by personal representatives which, if granted, would subject the personal representative to the penalties for contempt of Court if he disregarded the restriction. See Section 3-607. If a proceeding also involved a demand that particular real estate be kept in the estate pending determination of a petitioner’s claim thereto, notice of the pendency of the proceeding could be recorded as is usual under the jurisdiction’s system for the lis pendens concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “restricts” in the last sentence is intended to negate the idea that a judicial order specially qualifying the powers and duties of a personal representative is a restraining order in the usual sense. The section means simply that some supervised personal representatives may receive the same powers and duties as ordinary personal representatives, except that they must obtain a Court order before paying claimants or distributing, while others may receive a more restricted set of powers. Section 3-607 governs petitions which seek to limit the power of a personal representative.

       This section provides authority to issue letters showing restrictions of power of supervised administrators. In general, persons dealing with personal representatives are not bound to inquire concerning the authority of a personal representative, and are not affected by provisions in a will or judicial order unless they know of it. But, it is expected that persons dealing with personal representatives will want to see the personal representative’s letters, and this section has the practical effect of requiring them to do so. No provision is made for noting restrictions in letters except in the case of supervised representatives. See Section 3-715.

       Since supervised administration is a single proceeding, the notice requirement contained in Section 3-106 relates to the notice of institution of the proceedings which is described with particularity by Section 3-502. The above section makes it clear that an additional notice is required for a closing order. It was discussed whether provision for notice of interim orders should be included. It was decided to leave the point to be covered by court order or rule. There was a suggestion for a rule as follows: “Unless otherwise required by order, notice of interim orders in supervised administration need be given only to interested persons who request notice of all orders entered in the proceeding.” Section 1-402 permits any person to waive notice by a writing filed in the proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       A demand for notice under Section 3-204 would entitle any interested person to notice of any interim order which might be made in the course of supervised administration.

       This and related sections of this Part describe details and conditions of appointment which apply to all personal representatives without regard to whether the appointment proceeding involved is formal or informal, or whether the personal representative is supervised. Section 1-305 authorizes issuance of copies of letters and prescribes their content.

       Except for personal representatives appointed pursuant to Section 3-502, appointees are not deemed to be “officers” of the appointing court or to be parties in one continuous judicial proceeding that extends until final settlement. See Section 3-107. Yet, it is desirable to continue present patterns which prevent a personal representative who might make himself unavailable to service within the state from affecting the power of the appointing court to enter valid orders affecting him. See Michigan Trust Co. v. Ferry, 33 S. Ct. 550, 228 U.S. 346, 57 L. Ed. 867 (1912). The concept employed to accomplish this is that of requiring each appointee to consent in advance to the personal jurisdiction of the Court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted against him. The section requires that he be given notice of any such proceeding, which, when considered in the light of the responsibility he has undertaken, should make the procedure sufficient to meet the requirements of due process.

     <p>
      No bond is required of a personal representative appointed in informal proceedings, except (1) upon the appointment of a special administrator; (2) when an executor or other personal representative is appointed to administer an estate under a will containing an express requirement of bond or (3) when bond is required under section 15-3-605[, Idaho Code,] of this chapter. Bond may be required by court order at the time of appointment of a personal representative appointed in any formal proceeding except that bond is not required of a personal representative appointed in formal proceedings if the will relieves the personal representative of bond, unless bond has been requested by an interested party and the court is satisfied that it is desirable. Bond required by any will may be dispensed with in formal proceedings upon determination by the court that it is not necessary. No bond is required of any personal representative who, pursuant to statute, has deposited cash or collateral with an agency of this state to secure performance of his duties. No bond will be required of any domestic bank or trust company.

       This section must be read with the next three sections. The purpose of these provisions is to move away from the idea that bond always should be required of a probate fiduciary, or required unless a will excuses it. Also, it is designed to keep the registrar acting pursuant to applications in informal proceedings, from passing judgment in each case on the need for bond. The point is that the court and registrar are not responsible for seeing that personal representatives perform as they are supposed to perform. Rather, performance is coerced by the remedies available to interested persons. Interested persons are protected by their ability to demand prior notice of informal proceedings (Section 3-204), to contest a requested appointment by use of a formal testacy proceeding or by use of a formal proceeding seeking the appointment of another person. Section 3-105 gives general authority to the court in a formal proceeding to make appropriate orders as desirable incident to estate administration. This should be sufficient to make it clear that an informal application may be blocked by a formal petition which disputes the matters stated in the petition. Furthermore, an interested person has the remedies provided in Sections 3-605 and 3-607. Finally, interested persons have assurance under this Code that their rights in respect to the values of a decedent’s estate cannot be terminated without a judicial order after notice or before the passage of three years from the decedent’s death.
    It is believed that the total package of protection thus afforded may represent more real protection than a blanket requirement of bond. Surely, it permits a reduction in the procedures which must occur in uncomplicated estates where interested persons are perfectly willing to trust each other and the fiduciary.

      § 15-3-604. Bond amount — Security — Procedure — Reduction.
     </h3>
     <p>
      If bond is required and the provisions of the will or order do not specify the amount, unless stated in his application or petition, the person qualifying shall file a statement under oath with the registrar indicating his best estimate of the value of the personal estate of the decedent and of the income expected from the personal and real estate during the next year, and he shall execute and file a bond with the registrar, or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate. The registrar shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one (1) or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property or other adequate security. The registrar may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with a domestic financial institution (as defined in section 15-6-101[, Idaho Code,] of this code) in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition. On petition of the personal representative or another interested person the court may excuse a requirement of bond, increase or reduce the amount of the bond, release sureties, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.

       This section permits estimates of value needed to fix the amount of required bond to be filed when it becomes necessary. A consequence of this procedure is that estimates of value of estates no longer need appear in the petitions and applications which will attend every administered estate. Hence, a measure of privacy that is not possible under most existing procedures may be achieved. A co-signature arrangement might constitute adequate security within the meaning of this section.

     <p>
      Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or any creditor having a claim in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000), may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond. The demand must be filed with the clerk of the court and a copy mailed to the personal representative, if appointment and qualification have occurred. Thereupon, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond ceases to be interested in the estate, or if bond is excused as provided in section 15-3-603 or 15-3-604 [, Idaho Code,] of this Part. After he has received notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of his office except as necessary to preserve the estate. Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice is cause for his removal and appointment of a successor personal representative.

       The demand for bond described in this section may be made in a petition or application for appointment of a personal representative, or may be made after a personal representative has been appointed. The mechanism for compelling bond is designed to function without unnecessary judicial involvement. If demand for bond is made in a formal proceeding, the judge can determine the amount of bond to be required with due consideration for all circumstances. If demand is not made in formal proceedings, methods for computing the amount of bond are provided by statute so that the demand can be complied with without resort to judicial proceedings. The information which a personal representative is required by Section 3-705 to give each beneficiary includes a statement concerning whether bond has been required.

       Cf. Section 3-401 which provides for a restraining order against a previously appointed personal representative incident to a formal testacy proceeding. The above section describes a remedy which is available for any cause against a previously appointed personal representative, whether appointed formally or informally.

      <p>
       This remedy, in combination with the safeguards relating to the process for appointment of a personal representative, permit “control” of a personal representative that is believed to be equal, if not superior to, that presently available with respect to “supervised” personal representatives appointed by inferior courts. The request for a restraining order may mark the beginning of a new proceeding but the personal representative, by the consent provided in Section 3-602, is practically in the position of one who, on motion, may be cited to appear before a judge.

      Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in sections 15-3-609 through 15-3-612[, Idaho Code], inclusive, of this Part. Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by this code or any will, except that a personal representative, at any time prior to distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform acts necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a successor representative. Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve him of the duty to preserve assets subject to his control, to account therefor and to deliver the assets. Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative, but terminates his authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.

       “Termination,” as defined by this and succeeding provisions, provides definiteness respecting when the powers of a personal representative (who may or may not be discharged by court order) terminate.
    It is to be noted that this section does not relate to jurisdiction over the estate in proceedings which may have been commenced against the personal representative prior to termination. In such cases, a substitution of successor or special representative should occur if the plaintiff desires to maintain his action against the estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that “termination” is not “discharge.” However, an order of the Court entered under 3-1001 or 3-1002 both terminates the appointment of, and discharges, a personal representative.

      § 15-3-612. Termination of appointment — Change of testacy status.

     <p>
      Except as otherwise ordered in formal proceedings, the probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of a personal representative in intestacy or under a will which is superseded by formal probate of another will, or the vacation of an informal probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of the personal representative thereunder, does not terminate the appointment of the personal representative although his powers may be reduced as provided in section 15-3-401[, Idaho Code,] of this code. Termination occurs upon appointment in informal or formal appointment proceedings of a person entitled to appointment under the later assumption concerning testacy. If no request for new appointment is made within thirty (30) days after expiration of time for appeal from the order in formal testacy proceedings, or from the informal probate, changing the assumption concerning testacy, the previously appointed personal representative upon request may be appointed personal representative under the subsequently probated will, or as in intestacy as the case may be.

       This section and Section 3-401 describe the relationship between formal or informal proceedings which change a previous assumption concerning the testacy of the decedent, and a previously appointed personal representative. The basic assumption of both sections is that an appointment, with attendant powers of management, is separable from the basis of appointment; i.e., intestate or testate?; what will is the last will? Hence, a previously appointed personal representative continues to serve in spite of formal or informal proceedings that may give another a prior right to serve as personal representative. But, if the testacy status is changed in formal proceedings, the petitioner also may request appointment of the person who would be entitled to serve if his assumption concerning the decedent’s will prevails. Provision is made for a situation where all interested persons are content to allow a previously appointed personal representative to continue to serve even though another has a prior right because of a change relating to the decedent’s will. It is not necessary for the continuing representative to seek reappointment under the new assumption for Section 3-703 is broad enough to require him to administer the estate as intestate, or under a later probated will, if either status is established after he was appointed. Under Section 3-403, notice of a formal testacy proceeding is required to be given to any previously appointed personal representative. Hence, the testacy status cannot be changed without notice to a previously appointed personal representative.

       The appointment of a special administrator other than one appointed pending original appointment of a general personal representative must be handled by the Court. Appointment of a special administrator would enable the estate to participate in a transaction which the general personal representative could not, or should not, handle because of conflict of interest. If a need arises because of temporary absence or anticipated incapacity for delegation of the authority of a personal representative, the problem may be handled without judicial intervention by use of the delegation powers granted to personal representatives by Section 3-715(21).

      <p>
       In some areas of the country, particularly where wills cannot be probated without full notice and hearing, appointment of special administrators pending probate is sought almost routinely. The provisions of this Code concerning informal probate should reduce the number of cases in which a fiduciary will need to be appointed pending probate of a will. Nonetheless, there will be instances where contests begin before probate and where it may be necessary to appoint a special administrator. The objective of this section is to reduce the likelihood that contestants will be encouraged to file contests as early as possible simply to gain some advantage via having a person who is sympathetic to their cause appointed special administrator. Most will contests are not successful. Hence, it seems reasonable to prefer the named executor as special administrator where he is otherwise qualified.

        This section codifies the doctrine that the authority of a personal representative relates back to death from the moment it arises. It also makes it clear that authority of a personal representative stems from his appointment. The sentence concerning ratification is designed to eliminate technical questions that might arise concerning the validity of acts done by others prior to appointment. Section 3-715(21) relates to delegation of authority after appointment. The third sentence accepts an idea found in the Illinois Probate Act, § 79 [S.H.A. ch. 3, § 79].

       The qualification relating to “modification” of an appointment is intended to refer to the change that may occur in respect to the exclusive authority of one with letters upon later appointment of a co-representative or of a special administrator. The sentence concerning erroneous dual appointment is derived from recent New York legislation. See Section 704, Surrogate’s Court Procedure Act [McKinney’s SCPA 704].
      </p>
      <p>
       Erroneous appointment of a second personal representative is possible if formal proceedings after notice are employed. It might be desirable for a state to promulgate a system whereby a notation of letters issued by each county probate office would be relayed to a central record keeping office which, in turn, could indicate to any other office whether letters for a particular decedent, perhaps identified by social security number, had been issued previously. The problem can arise even though notice to known interested persons and by publication is involved.

       This and the next section are especially important sections for they state the basic theory underlying the duties and powers of personal representatives. Whether or not a personal representative is supervised, this section applies to describe the relationship he bears to interested parties. If a supervised representative is appointed, or if supervision of a previously appointed personal representative is ordered, an additional obligation to the court is created. See Section 3-501.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to subsection (a), a personal representative has a duty to settle and distribute the estate as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate. While this duty includes an obligation to ascertain the beneficiaries of the estate, it does not require the personal representative to delay distribution pending the possible birth of a posthumously conceived child. A delay is appropriate only if the personal representative has (1) received notice or has knowledge that there is an intention to use the decedent’s genetic material to create a child and (2) the birth of the child could have an effect on distribution of the decedent’s estate. Should the personal representative properly distribute the estate and a posthumously conceived child is later born, any remedy the child might have is against the other beneficiaries, and not the personal representative. See Sections 3-909, 3-1005.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental responsibility of a personal representative is that of a trustee. Unlike many trustees, a personal representative’s authority is derived from appointment by the public agency known as the Court. But, the Code also makes it clear that the personal representative, in spite of the source of his authority, is to proceed with the administration, settlement and distribution of the estate by use of statutory powers and in accordance with statutory directions. See Sections 3-107 and 3-704. Subsection (b) is particularly important, for it ties the question of personal liability for administrative or distributive acts to the question of whether the act was “authorized at the time.” Thus, a personal representative may rely upon and be protected by a will which has been probated without adjudication or an order appointing him to administer which is issued in no-notice proceedings even though proceedings occurring later may change the assumption as to whether the decedent died testate or intestate. See Section 3-302 concerning the status of a will probated without notice and Section 3-102 concerning the ineffectiveness of an unprobated will. However, it does
    not
    follow from the fact that the personal representative distributed under authority that the distributees may not be liable to restore the property or values received if the assumption concerning testacy is later changed. See Sections 3-909 and 3-1004. Thus, a distribution may be “authorized at the time” within the meaning of this section, but be “improper” under the latter section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (c) is designed to reduce or eliminate differences in the amenability to suit of personal representatives appointed under this Code and under traditional assumptions. Also, the subsection states that so far as the law of the appointing forum is concerned, personal representatives are subject to suit in other jurisdictions. It, together with various provisions of Article IV [Chapter 4], are designed to eliminate many of the present reasons for ancillary administrations.

The information shall be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. The duty does not extend to require information to persons who have been adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate. The information shall include the name and address of the personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether bond has been filed, and describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file. The personal representative’s failure to give this information is a breach of his duty to the persons concerned but does not affect the validity of his appointment, his powers or other duties. A personal representative may inform other persons of his appointment by delivery or ordinary first class mail.

       This section requires the personal representative to inform persons who appear to have an interest in the estate as it is being administered, of his appointment. Also, it requires the personal representative to give notice to persons who appear to be disinherited by the assumption concerning testacy under which the personal representative was appointed. The communication involved is not to be confused with the notice requirements relating to litigation. The duty applies even though there may have been a prior testacy proceeding after notice, except that persons who have been adjudicated to be without interest in the estate are excluded. The rights, if any, of persons in regard to estates cannot be cut off completely except by the running of the three year statute of limitations provided in Section 3-108, or by a formal judicial proceeding which will include full notice to all interested persons. The interests of some persons may be shifted from rights to specific property of the decedent to the proceeds from sale thereof, or to rights to values received by distributees. However, such a shift of protected interest from one thing to another, or to funds or obligations, is not new in relation to trust beneficiaries. A personal representative may initiate formal proceedings to determine whether persons, other than those appearing to have interests, may be interested in the estate, under Section 3-401 or, in connection with a formal closing, as provided by Section 3-1001.
    No information or notice is required by this section if no personal representative is appointed.

        This and the following sections eliminate the practice now required by many probate statutes under which the judge is involved in the selection of appraisers. If the personal representative breaches his duty concerning the inventory, he may be removed. Section 3-611. Or, an interested person seeking to surcharge a personal representative for losses incurred as a result of his administration might be able to take advantage of any breach of duty concerning inventory. The section provides two ways in which a personal representative may handle an inventory. If the personal representative elects to send copies to all interested persons who request it, information concerning the assets of the estate need not become a part of the records of the probate court. The alternative procedure is to file the inventory with the court. This procedure would be indicated in estates with large numbers of interested persons, where the burden of sending copies to all would be substantial. The Court’s role in respect to the second alternative is simply to receive and file the inventory with the file relating to the estate. See 3-204, which permits any interested person to demand notice of any document relating to an estate which may be filed with the Court.
    In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended elimination of the word “or” that separated the language dealing with the duty to send a copy of the inventory to interested persons requesting it, from the final part of the paragraph dealing with filing of the original. The purpose of the change was to prevent a literal interpretation of the original text that would have permitted a personal representative who filed the original inventory with the Court to avoid compliance with requests for copies from interested persons.

        The personal representative exercises control over the property of the estate, in a fiduciary capacity, until the close of administration of the estate. Therefore, for purposes of will provision that personal representative would not take under will if she died prior to distribution, neither the act of controlling the estate property in her fiduciary capacity as personal representative nor the act of possessing the estate property as the beneficiary presumptively entitled thereto was sufficient to constitute de facto distribution of the estate.

       Section 3-101 provides for the devolution of title on death. Section 3-711 defines the status of the personal representative with reference to “title” and “power” in a way that should make it unnecessary to discuss the “title” to decedent’s assets which his personal representative acquires. This section deals with the personal representative’s duty and right to possess assets. It proceeds from the assumption that it is desirable whenever possible to avoid disruption of possession of the decedent’s assets by his devisees or heirs. But, if the personal representative decides that possession of an asset is necessary or desirable for purposes of administration, his judgment is made conclusive in any action for possession that he may need to institute against an heir or devisee. It may be possible for an heir or devisee to question the judgment of the personal representative in later action for surcharge for breach of fiduciary duty, but this possibility should not interfere with the personal representative’s administrative authority as it relates to possession of the estate.
    This code follows the Model Probate Code in regard to partnership interests. In the introduction to the Model Probate Code, the following appears at p. 22:
      </p>
      <p>
       “No provisions for the administration of partnership estates when a partner dies have been included. Several states have statutes providing that unless the surviving partner files a bond with the probate court, the personal representative of the deceased partner may administer the partnership estate upon giving an additional bond. Kan. Gen. Stat. (Supp. 1943)<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.59.html#t59c10s59-1001" target="_blank">§§ 59-1001 </a></cite>to 59-1005; Mo. Rev. Stat. Ann. (1942) §§ 81 to 93 [V.A.M.S. §§ 473.220 to 473.230]. In these states the administration of partnership estates upon the death of a partner is brought more or less completely under the jurisdiction of the probate court. While the provisions afford security to parties in interest, they have caused complications in the settlement of partnership estates and have produced much litigation. Woener, Administration (3rd ed., 1923) §§ 128 to 130; annotation, 121 A.L.R. 860. These statutes have been held to be inconsistent with section 37 of the Uniform Partnership Act providing for winding up by the surviving partner. Davis v. Hutchinson (C.C.A. 9th, 1929) 36 F.(2d) 309. Hence the Model Probate Code contains no provision regarding partnership property except for inclusion in the inventory of the decedent’s proportionate share of any partnership. See Model Probate Code (1946) Section 120. However, it is suggested that the Uniform Partnership Act should be included in the statutes of the states which have not already enacted it.”

        The personal representative is given the broadest possible “power over title.” He receives a “
    power
    ,” rather than title, because the power concept eases the succession of assets which are not possessed by the personal representative. Thus, if the power is unexercised prior to its termination, its lapse clears the title of devisees and heirs. Purchasers from devisees or heirs who are “distributees” may be protected also by Section 3-910. The power over title of an absolute owner is conceived to embrace all possible transactions which might result in a conveyance or encumbrance of assets, or in a change of rights of possession. The relationship of the personal representative to the estate is that of a trustee. Hence, personal creditors or successors of a personal representative cannot avail themselves of his title to any greater extent than is true generally of creditors and successors of trustees. Interested persons who are apprehensive of possible misuse of power by a personal representative may secure themselves by use of the devices implicit in the several sections of Parts 1 and 3 of this Article. See especially Sections 3-501, 3-605, 3-607, and 3-611.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with him for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised his power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise. Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 15-3-504[, Idaho Code,] of this code, and without regard to the constructive notice provisions of section 15-1-305A[, Idaho Code,] of this code, no provision in any will or order of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is effective except as to persons with actual knowledge thereof. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a personal representative. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is found to be alive. The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

       This section qualifies the effect of a provision in a will which purports to prohibit sale of property by a personal representative. The provisions of a will may prescribe the duties of a personal representative and subject him to surcharge or other remedies of interested persons if he disregards them. See Section 3-703. But, the will’s prohibition is not relevant to the rights of a purchaser unless he had actual knowledge of its terms. Interested persons who want to prevent a personal representative from having the power described here must use the procedures described in Sections 3-501 to 3-505. Each state will need to identify the relation between this section and other statutory provisions creating liens on estate assets for inheritance and other taxes. The section cannot control whether a purchaser takes free of the lien of unpaid federal estate taxes. Hence, purchasers from personal representatives appointed pursuant to this Code will have to satisfy themselves concerning whether estate taxes are paid, and if not paid, whether the tax lien follows the property they are acquiring. See Section 6234, Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.S. § 6324].
    The impact of formal recording systems beyond the usual probate procedure depends upon the particular statute. In states in which the recording system provides for recording wills as muniments of title, statutory adaptation should be made to provide that recording of wills should be postponed until the validity has been established by probate or limitation. Statutory limitation to this effect should be added to statutes which do not so provide to avoid conflict with power of the personal representative during administration. The purpose of the Code is to make the deed or instrument of distribution the usual muniment of title. See sections 3-907, 3-908, and 3-910. However, this is not available when no administration has occurred and in that event reliance upon general recording statutes must be had.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a state continues to permit wills to be recorded as muniments of title, the above section would need to be qualified to give effect to the notice from recording.

        Where the personal representative’s failure to safeguard the property of the estate resulted in the liquidation of an asset and payment to another of the cash proceeds, which rightfully belonged to the estate, and where the enrichment through any interest which could have been accrued from the time of the sale to the time of reimbursement should be to the estate, not to those who stood to profit from the representative’s mismanagement of the estate, it was proper for the magistrate to order the personal representative to pay interest at the statutory rate on the proceeds of the sale of real estate.

        Where an administrator, deeming himself in a somewhat precarious position due to the disparity between the several appraisements and offers, petitioned the magistrate for a resolution of the question how best to dispose of the property, and the magistrate’s resolution of the question was that disposition of the property could best be effected by another solicitation of sealed bids, and ordered the administrator to do so, but where the order did not, however, require confirmation by the court for completion of the sale, the contemplated disposition was not a judicial sale by the court through the administrator as agent for the court, but rather the solicitation of bids and acceptance of a bid by the administrator.

      <p>
       This section accepts the assumption of the Uniform Trustee’s Powers Act that it is desirable to equip fiduciaries with the authority required for the prudent handling of assets and extends it to personal representatives. The section requires that a personal representative act reasonably and for the benefit of the interested person. Subject to this and to the other qualifications described by the preliminary statement, the enumerated transactions are made authorized transactions for personal representatives. Sub-paragraphs (27) and (18) support the other provisions of the Code, particularly Section 3-704, which contemplates that personal representatives will proceed with all of the business of administration without court orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       In part, sub-paragraph (4) involves a substantive question of whether noncontractual charitable pledges of a decedent can be honored by his personal representative. It is believed, however, that it is not desirable from a practical standpoint to make much turn on whether a charitable pledge is, or is not, contractual. Pledges are rarely made the subject of claims. The effect of sub-paragraph (4) is to permit the personal representative to discharge pledges where he believes the decedent would have wanted him to do so without exposing himself to surcharge. The holder of a contractual pledge may, of course, pursue the remedies of a creditor. If a pledge provides that the obligation ceases on the death of the pledgor, no personal representative would be safe in assuming that the decedent would want the pledge completed under the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) is not intended to affect the right to performance or to damages of any person who contracted with the decedent. To do so would constitute an unreasonable interference with private rights. The intention of the subsection is simply to give a personal representative who is obligated to carry out a decedent’s contracts the same alternatives in regard to the contractual duties which the decedent had prior to his death.

        With certain qualifications, this section is designed to compel corepresentatives to agree on all matters relating to administration when circumstances permit. Delegation by one to another representative is a form of concurrence in acts that may result from the delegation. A corepresentative who abdicates his responsibility to co-administer the estate by a blanket delegation breaches his duty to interested persons as described by Section 3-703. Section 3-715(21) authorizes some limited delegations, which are reasonable and for the benefit of interested persons.

       Source, Model Probate Code section 102. This section applies where one of two or more co-representatives dies, becomes disabled or is removed. In regard to co-executors, it is based on the assumption that the decedent would not consider the powers of his fiduciaries to be personal, or to be suspended if one or more could not function. In regard to co-administrators in intestacy, it is based on the idea that the reason for appointing more than one ceases on the death or disability of either of them.

      A personal representative is entitled to reasonable compensation for his services. If a will provides for compensation of the personal representative and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation, he may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation. A personal representative may also renounce his right to all or any part of the compensation. A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.

        Where the personal representative for the estate failed to bear her burden of proving her requests for reimbursement, the estate did not benefit from her representation, and the estate had to expend substantial costs in litigation against her, the magistrate properly concluded that the personal representative was not entitled to a fee for serving as representative for the estate.

        An executor or administrator must be appointed to take possession of and care for the property of an estate, and whether such appointment turns out to be legal or illegal, such person, whether representing the estate as executor or administrator, de facto or de jure, is equally liable for the care of the estate and is entitled to his lawful expenses and disbursements in connection therewith.

       Litigation prosecuted by a personal representative for the primary purpose of enhancing his prospects for compensation would not be in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       A personal representative is a fiduciary for successors of the estate (Section 3-703). Though the will naming him may not yet be probated, the priority for appointment conferred by Section 3-203 on one named executor in a probated will means that the person named has an interest, as a fiduciary, in seeking the probate of the will. Hence, he is an interested person within the meaning of sections 3-301 and 3-401. Section 3-912 gives the successors of an estate control over the executor, provided all are competent adults. So, if all persons possibly interested in the probate of a will, including trustees of any trusts created thereby, concur in directing the named executor to refrain from efforts to probate the instrument, he would lose standing to proceed. All of these observations apply with equal force to the case where the named executor of one instrument seeks to contest the probate of another instrument. Thus, the Code changes the idea followed in some jurisdictions that an executor lacks standing to contest other wills which, if valid, would supersede the will naming him, and standing to oppose other contests that may be mounted against the instrument nominating him.

       In view of the broad jurisdiction conferred on the probate court by Section 3-105, description of the special proceeding authorized by this section might be unnecessary. But, the Code’s theory that personal representatives may fix their own fees and those of estate attorneys marks an important departure from much existing practice under which fees are determined by the court in the first instance. Hence, it seemed wise to emphasize that any interested person can get judicial review of fees if he desires it. Also, if excessive fees have been paid, this section provides a quick and efficient remedy.

        The need for uniformity of law regarding creditors’ claims against estates is especially strong. Commercial and consumer credit depends upon efficient collection procedures. The cost of credit is pushed up by the cost of credit life insurance which becomes a practical necessity for lenders unwilling to bear the expense of understanding or using the cumbersome and provincial collection procedures found in 50 codes of probate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sections which follow facilitate collection of claims against decedents in several ways. First, a simple written statement mailed to the personal representative is a sufficient “claim.” Allowance of claims is handled by the personal representative and is assumed if a claimant is not advised of disallowance. Also, a personal representative may pay any just claims without presentation and at any time, if he is willing to assume risks which will be minimal in many cases. The period of uncertainty regarding possible claims is only four months from first publication. This should expedite settlement and distribution of estates.

       <p>
        Section 3-1203, relating to small estates, contains an important qualification on the duty created by this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1989, the Joint Editorial Board recommended replacement of the word “shall” with “[may] [shall]” in (a) to signal its approval of a choice between mandatory publication and optional publication of notice to creditors to be made by the legislature in an enacting state. Publication of notice to creditors is quite expensive in some populous areas of the country and, if
    Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope
    , 108 S. Ct. 1340, 485 U.S. 478 (1988) applies to this code, is useless except to bar unknown creditors. Even if
        Pope
        does not apply, personal representatives for estates involving successors willing to assume the risk of unbarred claims should have (and have had under the code as a practical consequence of absence of Court supervision and mandatory closings) the option of failing to publish.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional discussion of the impact of
    Pope
    on the Code appears in the Comment to Section 3-803, infra.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a state elects to make publication of notice to creditors a duty for personal representatives, failure to advertise for claims would involve a breach of duty on the part of the personal representative. If, as a result of such breach, a claim is later asserted against a distributee under Section 3-1004, the personal representative may be liable to the distributee for costs related to discharge of the claim and the recovery of contribution from other distributees. The protection afforded personal representatives under Section 3-1003 would not be available, for that section applies only if the personal representative truthfully recites that the time limit for presentation of claims has expired.
    Putting aside
    Pope
    case concerns regarding state action under this code, it might be appropriate, by legislation, to channel publications through the personnel of the probate Court.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 1-401. If notices are controlled by a centralized authority, some assurance could be gained against publication in newspapers of small circulation. Also, the form of notices could be made uniform and certain efficiencies could be achieved. For example, it would be compatible with this section for the Court to publish a single notice each day or each week listing the names of personal representatives appointed since the last publication, with addresses and dates of non-claim.

      <p>
       This section means that four months is added to the normal period of limitations by reason of a debtor’s death before a debt is barred. It implies also that after the expiration of four months from death, the normal statute of limitations may run and bar a claim even though the non-claim provisions of Section 3-803 have not been triggered. Hence, the non-claim and limitation provisions of Section 3-803 are not mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that under Sections 3-803 and 3-804 it is possible for a claim to be barred by the process of claim, disallowance and failure by the creditor to commence a proceeding to enforce his claim prior to the end of the four month suspension period. Thus, the regular statute of limitations applicable during the debtor’s lifetime, the non-claim provisions of Sections 3-803 and 3-804, and the three-year limitation of Section 3-803 all have potential application to a claim. The first of the three to accomplish a bar controls.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended a change that makes it clear that only those successors who would be affected thereby, must agree to a waiver of a defense of limitations available to an estate. As the original text stood, the section appeared to require the consent of “all successors,” even though this would include some who, under the rules of abatement, could not possibly be affected by allowance and payment of the claim in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1989, in connection with other amendments recommended in sequel to
    Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope
    , 108 S. Ct. 1340, 485 U.S. 478 (1988), the Joint Editorial Board recommended the splitting out, into Subsections (b) and (c), of the last two sentences of what formerly was a four-sentence section. The first two sentences now appear as Subsection (a). The rearrangement aids understanding that the section deals with three separable ideas. No other change in language is involved, and the timing of the changes to coincide with
       Pope
       case amendments is purely coincidental.

      </h4>
      <p>
       There was some disagreement among the Reporters over whether a short period of limitations, or of non-claim, should be provided for claims arising at or after death. Subparagraph (b) was finally inserted because most felt it was desirable to accelerate the time when unadjudicated distributions would be final. The time limits stated would not, of course, affect any personal liability in contract, tort, or by statute, of the personal representative. Under Section 3-808 a personal representative is not liable on transactions entered into on behalf of the estate unless he agrees to be personally liable or unless he breaches a duty by making the contract. Creditors of the estate and not of the personal representative thus face a special limitation that runs four months after performance is due from the personal representative. Tort claims normally will involve casualty insurance of the decedent or of the personal representative, and so will fall within the exception of subparagraph (d) [(e)]. If a personal representative is personally at fault in respect to a tort claim arising after the decedent’s death, his personal liability would not be affected by the running of the special short period provided here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1989, the Joint Editorial Board recommended amendments to Subsection (a). The change in (1) shortens the ultimate limitations period on claims against a decedent from 3 years after death to 1 year after death. Corresponding amendments were recommended for Sections 3-1003(a)(1) and 3-1006. The new one-year from death limitation (which applies without regard to whether or when an estate is opened for administration) is designed to prevent concerns stemming from the possible applicability to this Code of
    Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope
    , 108 S. Ct. 1340, 485 U.S. 478 (1988) from unduly prolonging estate settlements and closings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(2), by reference to Sections 3-801(a) and 3-801(b), adds an additional method of barring a prospective claimant of whom the personal representative is aware. The new bar is available when it is appropriate, under all of the circumstances, to send a mailed warning to one or more known claimants who have not presented claims that the recipient’s claim will be barred if not presented within 60 days from the notice. This optional, mailed notice, described in accompanying new text in Section 3-801(b), is designed to enhance the ability of personal representatives to protect distributees against pass-through liability (under Section 3-1004) to possibly unbarred claimants. Personal representatives acting in the best interests of successors to the estate (see Section 3-703(a) and the definition of “successors” in Section 1-201(42) [(50)]) may determine that successors are willing to assume risks (i) that
    Pope
    , supra, will be held to apply to this Code in spite of absence of any significant contact between an agency of the state and the acts of a personal representative operating independently of Court supervision; and (ii) that a possibly unbarred claim is valid and will be pursued by its owner against estate distributees in time to avoid bar via the earliest to run of its own limitation period (which, under Section 3-802(b), resumes running four months after death), or the one-year [three-years] from death limitation now provided by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-803" target="_blank">§ 3-803</a></cite>(a)(1). If publication of notice as provided in Section 3-801 has occurred and if
    <i>
     Pope
    </i>
    either is inapplicable to this Code or is applicable but the late-arising claim in question is judged to have been unknown to the personal representative and unlikely to have been discovered by reasonable effort, an earlier, four months from first publication bar will apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Joint Editorial Board recognized that the new bar running one year after death [not adopted in Idaho] may be used by some sets of successors to avoid payment of claims against their decedents of which they are aware. Successors who are willing to delay receipt and enjoyment of inheritances may consider waiting out the non-claim period running from death simply to avoid any public record of an administration that might alert known and unknown creditors to pursue their claims. The scenario was deemed to be unlikely, however, for unpaid creditors of a decedent are interested persons (Section 1-201(20) [(25)]) who are qualified to force the opening of an estate for purposes of presenting and enforcing claims. Further, successors who delay opening an administration will suffer from lack of proof of title to estate assets and attendant inability to enjoy their inheritances. Finally, the odds that holders of important claims against the decedent will need help in learning of the death and proper place of administration is rather small. Any benefit to such claimants of additional procedures designed to compel administrations and to locate and warn claimants of an impending non-claim bar, is quite likely to be heavily outweighed by the costs such procedures would impose on all estates, the vast majority of which are routinely applied to quick payment of the decedents’ bills and distributed without any creditor controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the new bar [not adopted in Idaho] described by Section 3-801(b) and Section 3-803(a)(2) is the earlier of one year from death or the period described by reference to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-801" target="_blank">§ 3-801</a></cite>(b) and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-801" target="_blank">§ 3-801</a></cite>(a) in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-803" target="_blank">§ 3-803</a></cite>(a)(2). If publication of notice is made under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-801" target="_blank">§ 3-801</a></cite>(a), and the personal representative thereafter gives actual notice to a known creditor, when is the creditor barred? If the actual notice is given less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the four months from first publication period, the claim will not be barred four months after first publication because the actual notice given by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-801" target="_blank">§ 3-801</a></cite>(b) advises the creditor that it has no less than 60 days to present the claim. It is as if the personal representative gave the claimant a written waiver of any benefit the estate may have had by reason of the four month bar following published notice. (c.f., the ability of a personal representative, under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-802" target="_blank">§ 3-802 </a></cite>to change claims from allowed to disallowed, and vice versa, and the 60 day period given by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-806" target="_blank">§ 3-806</a></cite>(a) within which a claimant may contest a disallowance). The period ending with the running of 60 days from actual notice replaces the four month from publication period as the “time for original presentation” referred to in Section 3-806(a).
    Note, too, that if there is no publication of notice as provided in Section 3-801(a), the giving of actual notice to known creditors establishes separate, 60 days from time of notice, non-claim periods for those so notified. The failure to publish also means that no general non-claim period, other than the one year [three-year] period running from death, will be working for the estate. If an actual notice to a creditor is given before notice by publication is given, a question arises as to whether the 60 day period from actual notice, or the longer, four-month from publication applies. Subsections 3-801(a) and (b), which are pulled into Section 3-803(a)(2) by reference, make no distinction between actual notices given before publication and those given after publication. Hence, it would seem that the later time bar would control in either case. This reading also fits more satisfactorily with Section 3-806(a) and other code language referring in various contexts to “the time limit prescribed in §<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-803" target="_blank">§ 3-803</a></cite>.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The proviso, formerly appended to 3-803(a)(1), regarding the effect in this state of the prior running of a non-claim statute of the decedent’s domicile, has been restated as 3-803(b), and former subsections (b) and (c) have been redesignated as (c) and (d) [(e)]. The relocation of the proviso was made to improve the style of the section. No change of meaning is intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second paragraph of the original comment has been deleted because of inconsistency with amended<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-803" target="_blank">§ 3-803</a></cite>(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1989 changes recommended by the Joint Editorial Board relating to former<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-803" target="_blank">§ 3-803</a></cite>(b) now designated as 3-803(c) are unrelated to the
    Pope
    case problem. The original text failed to describe a satisfactory non-claim period for claims arising at or after the decedent’s death other than claims based on contract. The four months “after [any other claim] arises” period worked unjustly as to tort claims stemming from accidents causing the decedent’s death by snuffing out claims too quickly, sometimes before an estate had been opened. The language added by the 1989 amendment assures such claimants against any bar working prior to the later of one year [three years] after death or four months from the time the claim arises.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other change affecting what is now<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.03.html#t03c08s3-803" target="_blank">§ 3-803</a></cite>(d) [(e)] is the addition of a third class of items which are not barred by any time bar running from death, publication of notice to creditors, or any actual notice given to an estate creditor. The addition resembles a modification to the Code as enacted in Arizona.

        When an application has been made by a creditor to present a claim against the estate of a decedent, supported by a proper affidavit, an order should be made permitting its presentation.

        The filing of a claim with the probate court under (2) [(b)] of this section does not serve to initiate a proceeding concerning the claim. Rather, it serves merely to protect the claimant who may anticipate some need for evidence to show that his claim is not barred. The probate court acts simply as a depository of the statement of claim, as is true of its responsibility for an inventory filed with it under Section 3-706.
    In reading this section it is important to remember that a regular statute of limitation may run to bar a claim before the non-claim provisions run. See Section 3-802.

    Where mortgagee presents his claim as unsecured, and administrator inadvertently includes him in a pro rata distribution of assets among creditors, and trial court directs that amount so paid mortgagee be refunded to administrator, mortgagee cannot be deemed to have participated in the general assets of the estate, and his measure of relief in action for foreclosure is limited to the security, all right to a deficiency judgment having been waived.

       As to claims presented in the manner described in section 15-3-804(a)[, Idaho Code,] of this Part within the time limit prescribed in 15-3-803[, Idaho Code,] of this Part, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been disallowed. If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative changes his decision concerning the claim, he shall notify the claimant. The personal representative may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the claim has run and the claim has been barred. Every claim which is disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant files a petition for allowance in the court or commences a proceeding against the personal representative not later than sixty (60) days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the impending bar. Failure of the personal representative to mail notice to a claimant of action on his claim for sixty (60) days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired has the effect of a notice of allowance.

Notice in this proceeding shall be given to the claimant, the personal representative and those other persons interested in the estate as the court may direct by order entered at the time the proceeding is commenced.

        If claim of United States is rejected by administratrix, the United States can sue the administratrix in federal district court, even though state statute of limitations has run on the claim, since United States is not bound by state statute of limitations or subject to defense of laches. United States v. Gibson, 101 F. Supp. 225 (D. Idaho 1951), rev’d on other grounds, 225 F.2d 807 (9th Cir. 1955).
    Judgment rendered against executor or administrator upon a claim for money against the estate of his testator or intestate only establishes claim in the same manner as if it had been allowed by executor or administrator, and judgment must be that executor or administrator pay in due course of administration amount ascertained to be due. McElroy v. Whitney, 24 Idaho 210, 133 P. 118 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the duty of an administrator of an estate to file with the court claims against the estate which have been rejected by the administrator. Chandler v. Probate Court, 26 Idaho 173, 141 P. 635 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusal of executor to make a conveyance of real property to decedent’s grantee, without the decree of court, does not create a right of action against estate in favor of grantee for money paid by latter on the purchase-price of the property, and a claim therefor is not a valid claim against estate. Blake v. Lemp, 32 Idaho 158, 179 P. 737 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an administrator is adversely claiming property which a creditor alleges belongs to the estate, and the creditor’s claim against the estate has been rejected, the creditor may maintain an action against the administrator to account for such property and to recover judgment on his rejected claim. Simonton v. Simonton, 33 Idaho 255, 193 P. 386 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action by cotenant to have money expended by him declared lien against share of his cotenant in property, his rights may be enforced although recourse against other property of his deceased cotenant is not waived in complaint, since lien of advancing tenant is limited to interest of his cotenant in common estate. Thurston v. Holden, 45 Idaho 724, 265 P. 697 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action by an executor or administrator on a claim which he has filed against the estate and which has been rejected is against the estate, not against the judge, and hence the estate can appeal from a judgment for an administratrix on her claim. Dowd v. Dowd, 62 Idaho 157, 108 P.2d 287 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party claiming an interest in an estate of a deceased person cannot present his claim and establish his status as such claimant in the first instance on appeal to the district court from a decree of a probate court distributing the estate. In re Lincoln’s Estate, 79 Idaho 131, 312 P.2d 113 (1957).

       <p>
        Claim by beneficiaries of decedent’s contract to devise and bequeath is not claim against estate such as to be required to be filed with executor or administrator.

        Former section did not preclude mortgagee from first presenting his claim for mortgage debt to administrator and afterward foreclosing his mortgage to obtain deficiency remaining after part-payment out of estate. First Nat’l Bank v. Glenn, 10 Idaho 224, 77 P. 623 (1904); Weiser Loan & Trust Co. v. Comerford, 41 Idaho 172, 238 P. 515 (1925); Berry v. Scott, 43 Idaho 789, 255 P. 305 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claim has been presented and allowed by administrator and holder still wishes to bring action to foreclose, he must waive recourse against other assets of the estate. First Nat’l Bank v. Glenn, 10 Idaho 224, 77 P. 623 (1904); Weiser Loan & Trust Co. v. Comerford, 41 Idaho 172, 238 P. 515 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a claim upon a mortgage has been presented and rejected, foreclosure can be had without waiver of the right to a deficiency claim against the estate. Weiser Loan & Trust Co. v. Comerford, 41 Idaho 172, 238 P. 515 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        At the death of a mortgagor, the mortgagee may either waive all recourse to a deficiency judgment and look to the security alone to pay the mortgage or he may present his claim to the executor or administrator and, if rejected, then bring action to foreclose without waiving recourse against other property of the estate for any deficiency. Berry v. Scott, 43 Idaho 789, 255 P. 305 (1927).

        The approval of an administrator’s payments of interest on a mortgage indebtedness by the court and an order settling the final account and distributing the property subject to the mortgage, where the order was permitted to become final, was conclusive on the validity of the mortgage and could not be attacked on the ground that the note and mortgage were barred by the statute of limitations.

       As recommended for amendment in 1989 by the Joint Editorial Board, the section directs the personal representative to pay allowed claims at the earlier of one year [three years] from death or the expiration of 4 months from first publication. This interpretation reflects that distribution need not be delayed further on account of creditors’ claims once a time bar running from death or publication has run, for known creditors who have failed to present claims by such time may have received an actual notice leading to a bar 60 days thereafter and in any event can and should be the occasion for withholding or the making of other provision by the personal representative to cover the possibility of later presentation and allowance of such claims. Distribution would also be appropriate whenever competent and solvent distributees expressly agree to indemnify the estate for any claims remaining unbarred and undischarged after the distribution.

       In the absence of statute an executor, administrator or a trustee is personally liable on contracts entered into in his fiduciary capacity unless he expressly excludes personal liability in the contract. He is commonly personally liable for obligations stemming from ownership or possession of the property (e. g., taxes) and for torts committed by servants employed in the management of the property. The claimant ordinarily can reach the estate only after exhausting his remedies against the fiduciary as an individual and then only to the extent that the fiduciary is entitled to indemnity from the property. This and the following sections are designed to make the estate a quasi-corporation for purposes of such liabilities. The personal representative would be personally liable only if an agent for a corporation would be under the same circumstances, and the claimant has a direct remedy against the quasi-corporate property.

        In allowing a claim the personal representative may deduct any counterclaim which the estate has against the claimant. In determining a claim against an estate a court shall reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess. A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that upon which the claim is based. A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the claim.

       Section 2-609 establishes a rule of construction against exoneration. Thus, unless the will indicates to the contrary, a specific devisee of mortgaged property takes subject to the lien without right to have other assets applied to discharge the secured obligation.

       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended substitution of the word “presented”, in the first sentence, for the word “filed” in the original text. The change aligns this section with Section 3-804, which describes several methods, including mailing or delivery to the personal representative, as methods of protecting a claim against non-claim provisions of the Code.

       Under Section 3-803(a) (1), if a local (property only) administration is commenced and proceeds to advertisement for claims before non-claim statutes have run at domicile, claimants may prove claims in the local administration at any time before the local non-claim period expires. Section 3-815 has the effect of subjecting all assets of the decedent, wherever they may be located and administered, to claims properly presented in any local administration. It is necessary, however, that the personal representative of any portion of the estate be aware of other administrations in order for him to become responsible for claims and charges established against other administrations.

       A testator may determine the order in which the assets of his estate are applied to the payment of his debts. If he does not, then the provisions of this section express rules which may be regarded as approximating what testators generally want. The statutory order of abatement is designed to aid in resolving doubts concerning the intention of a particular testator, rather than to defeat his purpose. Hence, subsection (b) directs that consideration be given to the purpose of a testator. This may be revealed in many ways. Thus, it is commonly held that, even in the absence of statute, general legacies to a wife, or to persons with respect to which the testator is in loco parentis, are to be preferred to other legacies in the same class because this accords with the probable purpose of the legacies.

        Unlike the common law, this section provides that a general pecuniary devisee’s right to interest begins one year from the time when administration was commenced, rather than one year from death. The rule provided here is similar to the common law rule in that the right to interest for delayed payment does not depend on whether the estate in fact realized income during the period of delay. The section is consistent with Section 5(b) of the Revised Uniform Principal and Income Act which allocates realized net income of an estate between various categories of successors.

        An heir may convey his interest in real property of the estate to a third party before a final decree of distribution, and, if such conveyance is uncontested, distribution may be made to the assignee.

        The order of a court ordering distribution of a share of an estate to an heir’s transferee does not adjudicate the validity of title between the heir and the transferee, since the court has no jurisdiction to determine that question.

       This section establishes a preference for distribution in kind. It directs a personal representative to make distribution in kind whenever feasible and to convert assets to cash only where there is a special reason for doing so. It provides a reasonable means for determining value of assets distributed in kind. It is implicit in Sections 3-101, 3-901 and this section that each residuary beneficiary’s basic right is to his proportionate share of each asset constituting the residue.

       This and sections following should be read with Section 3-709 which permits the personal representative to leave certain assets of a decedent’s estate in the possession of the person presumptively entitled thereto. The “release” contemplated by this section would be used as evidence that the personal representative had determined that he would not need to disturb the possession of an heir or devisee for purposes of administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 3-711, a personal representative’s relationship to assets of the estate is described as the “same power over the title to property of the estate as an absolute owner would have.” A personal representative may, however, acquire a full title to estate assets, as in the case where particular items are conveyed to the personal representative by sellers, transfer agents or others. The language of Section 3-907 is designed to cover instances where the instrument of distribution operates as a transfer, as well as those in which its operation is more like a release.

       The term “improperly” as used in this section must be read in light of Section 3-703 and the manifest purpose of this and other sections of the Code to shift questions concerning the propriety of various distributions from the fiduciary to the distributees in order to prevent every administration from becoming an adjudicated matter. Thus, a distribution may be “authorized at the time” as contemplated by Section 3-703, and still be “improper” under this section. Section 3-703 is designed to permit a personal representative to distribute without risk in some cases, even though there has been no adjudication. When an unadjudicated distribution has occurred, the rights of persons to show that the basis for the distribution (e. g., an informally probated will, or informally issued letters of administration) is incorrect, or that the basis was improperly applied (erroneous interpretation, for example) is preserved against distributees by this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “distributee” to include the trustee and beneficiary of a testamentary trust in 1-201(10) [(14)] is important in allocating liabilities that may arise under Sections 3-909 and 3-910 on improper distribution by the personal representative under an informally probated will. The provisions of Sections 3-909 and 3-910 are based on the theory that liability follows the property and the fiduciary is absolved from liability by reliance upon the informally probated will.

      If property distributed in kind or a security interest therein is acquired for value by a purchaser from, or lender to, a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, or is so acquired by a purchaser from or lender to a transferee from such distributee, the purchaser or lender takes title free of rights of any interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, or to any interested person, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order and whether or not the authority of the personal representative was terminated prior to execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, has executed a deed of distribution to himself, as well as a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or his transferee. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated prior to the distribution.

      Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, competent successors may agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares, or amounts to which they are entitled under the will of the decedent, or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that they provide in a written contract executed by all who are affected by its provisions. The personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement subject to his obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and costs of administration, and to carry out the responsibilities of his office for the benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties. Personal representatives of decedent’s [decedents’] estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee thereof is another person who is willing to accept the trust.

       It may be asserted that this section is only a restatement of the obvious and should be omitted. Its purpose, however, is to make it clear that the successors to an estate have residual control over the way it is to be distributed. Hence, they may compel a personal representative to administer and distribute as they may agree and direct. Successors should compare the consequences and possible advantages of careful use of the power to renounce as described by Section 2-801 with the effect of agreement under this section. The most obvious difference is that an agreement among successors under this section would involve transfers by some participants to the extent it changed the pattern of distribution from that otherwise applicable.
    Differing from a pattern that is familiar in many states, this Code does not subject testamentary trusts and trustees to special statutory provisions, or supervisory jurisdiction. A testamentary trustee is treated as a devisee with special duties which are of no particular concern to the personal representative. Article VII [Chapter 7] contains optional procedures extending the safeguards available to personal representatives to trustees of both inter vivos and testamentary trusts.

      <p>
       This section is concerned with the fiduciary responsibility of the executor to beneficiaries of trusts to which he may deliver. Normally, the trustee represents beneficiaries in matters involving third persons, including prior fiduciaries. Yet, the executor may apprehend that delivery to the trustee may involve risks for the safety of the fund and for him. For example, he may be anxious to see that there is no equivocation about the devisee’s willingness to accept the trust, and no problem of preserving evidence of the acceptance. He may have doubts about the integrity of the trustee, or about his ability to function satisfactorily. The testator’s selection of the trustee may have been based on facts which are still current, or which are of doubtful relevance at the time of distribution. If the risks relate to the question of the trustee’s intention to handle the fund without profit for himself, a conflict of interest problem is involved. If the risk relates to the ability of the trustee to manage prudently, a more troublesome question is posed for the executor. Is he, as executor, not bound to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries?
    In many instances involving doubts of this sort, the executor probably will want the protection of a Court order. Sections 3-1001 and 3-1002 provide ample authority for an appropriate proceeding in the Court which issued the executor’s letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other cases, however, the executor may believe that he may be adequately protected if the acceptance of the trust by the devisee is unequivocal, or if the trustee is bonded. The purpose of this section is to make it clear that it is proper for the executor to require the trustee to register the trust and to notify beneficiaries before receiving distribution. Also, the section complements Section 7-304 by providing that the personal representative may petition an appropriate court to require that the trustee be bonded.

        Status of testamentary trustees under the Uniform Probate Code.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the Uniform Probate Code, the testamentary trustee by construction would be considered a devisee, distributee, and successor to whom title passes at time of the testator’s death even though the will must be probated to prove the transfer. The informally probated will is conclusive until set aside and the personal representative may distribute to the trustee under the informally probated will or settlement agreement and the title of the trustee as distributee represented by the instrument or deed of distribution is conclusive until set aside on showing that it is improper. Should the informally probated will be set aside or the distribution to the trustee be shown to be improper, the trustee as distributee would be liable for value received but purchasers for value from the trustee as distributee under an instrument of distribution would be protected. Section 1-201’s definition of “distributee” limits the distributee liability of the trustee and substitutes that of the trust beneficiaries to the extent of distributions by the trustee.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a distributee as defined by Section 1-201, the testamentary trustee or beneficiary of a testamentary trust is liable to claimants like other distributees, would have the right of contribution from other distributees of the decedent’s estate and would be protected by the same time limitations as other distributees (Section 3-1006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Incident to his standing as a distributee of the decedent’s estate, the testamentary trustee would be an interested party who could petition for an order of complete settlement by the personal representative or for an order terminating testate administration. He also could appropriately receive the personal representative’s account and distribution under a closing statement. As distributee he could represent his beneficiaries in compromise settlements in the decedent’s estate which would be binding upon him and his beneficiaries. See Section 3-912.
       </p>
       <p>
        The general fiduciary responsibilities of the testamentary trustee are not altered by the Uniform Probate Code and the trustee continues to have the duty to collect and reduce to possession within a reasonable time the assets of the trust estate including the enforcement of any claims on behalf of the trust against prior fiduciaries, including the personal representative, and third parties.

        Decree of distribution is a final judgment and decree to extent of determining that all the interest that the estate had in certain property shall pass and be distributed to the heirs of deceased. It determines who are the heirs and their respective shares and interests in the estate, but it is not a decree affecting or adjudicating title to the property as between the estate or heirs to the estate and any third party.

        Subsection (b) is derived from § 64(b) of the Illinois Probate Act (1967) [S.H.A. ch. 3, § 64(b)]. Section 3-106 specifies that an order is binding as to all who are given notice even though less than all interested persons were notified. This section provides a method of curing an oversight in regard to notice which may come to light before the estate is finally settled. If the person who failed to receive notice of the earlier proceeding succeeds in obtaining entry of a different order from that previously made, others who received notice of the earlier proceeding may be benefitted. Still, they are not entitled to notice of the curative proceeding, nor should they be permitted to appear.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an order of settlement of the estate which will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent. The personal representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after one (1) year, from the appointment of the original personal representative, except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims which arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe the will and adjudicate final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all devisees and the personal representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those he represents. If it appears that a part of the estate is intestate, the proceedings shall be dismissed or amendments made to meet the provisions of section 15-3-1001[, Idaho Code,] of this Part.

       Section 3-1002 permits a final determination of the rights between each other and against the personal representative of the devisees under a will when there has been no formal proceeding in regard to testacy. Hence, the heirs in intestacy need not be made parties. Section 3-1001 permits a final determination of the rights between each other and against the personal representative of all persons interested in an estate. If supervised administration is used, Section 3-505 directs that the estate be closed by use of procedures like those described in 3-1001. Of course, testacy will have been adjudicated before time for the closing proceeding if supervised administration is used.

      <p>
       The Code uses “termination” to refer to events which end a personal representative’s authority. See Sections 3-608, et seq. The word “closing” refers to circumstances which support the conclusions that the affairs of the estate either are, or have been alleged to have been, wound up. If the affairs of the personal representative are reviewed and adjudicated under either Sections 3-1001 or 3-1002, the judicial conclusion that the estate is wound up serves also to terminate the personal representative’s authority. See Section 3-610(b). On the other hand, a “closing” statement under Section 3-1003 is only an affirmation by the personal representative that he believes the affairs of the estate to be completed. The statement is significant because it reflects that assets have been distributed. Any creditor whose claim has not been barred and who has not been paid is permitted by Section 3-1004 to assert his claim against distributees. The personal representative is also still fully subject to suit under Sections 3-602 and 3-608, for his authority is not “terminated” under Section 3-610(a) until one year after a closing statement is filed. Even if his authority is “terminated,” he remains liable to suit unless protected by limitation or unless an adjudication settling his accounts is the reason for “termination”. See Sections 3-1005 and 3-608.
    From a slightly different viewpoint, a personal representative may obtain a complete discharge of his fiduciary obligations through a judicial proceeding after notice. Sections 3-1001 and 3-1002 describe two proceedings which enable a personal representative to gain protection from all persons or from devisees only. A personal representative who neither obtains a judicial order of protection nor files a closing statement, is protected by Section 3-703 in regard to acts or distributions which were authorized when done but which become doubtful thereafter because of a change in testacy status. On the other questions, the personal representative who does not take any of the steps described by the Code to gain more protection has no protection against later claims of breach of his fiduciary obligation other than any arising from consent or waiver of individual distributees who may have bound themselves by receipts given to the personal representative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section increases the prospects of full discharge of a personal representative who uses the closing statement route over those of a personal representative who relies on receipts. Full protection follows from the running of the six months limitations period described in Section 3-1005. But, 3-1005’s protection does not prevent distributees from claiming lack of full disclosure. Hence, it offers little more protection than a receipt. Still, it may be useful to decrease the likelihood of later claim of non-disclosure. Its more significant function, however, is to provide a means for terminating the office of personal representative in a way that will be obvious to third persons.

As between distributees, each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of administration. Any distributee who shall have failed to notify other distributees of the demand made upon him by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in any proceeding in which the claim was asserted against him loses his right of contribution against other distributees.

       This section creates a ceiling on the liability of a distributee of “the value of his distribution” as of the time of distribution. The section indicates that each distributee is liable for all that a claimant may prove to be due, provided the claim does not exceed the value of the defendant’s distribution from the estate. But, each distributee may preserve a right of contribution against other distributees. The risk of insolvency of one or more, but less than all distributees, is on the distributee rather than on the claimant.
    In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended the addition, after “claimants for amounts” in the second sentence, of “received as exempt property, homestead or family allowances, or for amounts . . .” The purpose of the addition was to prevent unpaid creditors of a decedent from attempting to enforce their claims against a spouse or child who had received a distribution of exempt values.

       This and the preceding section make it clear that a claimant whose claim has not been barred may have alternative remedies when an estate has been distributed subject to his claim. Under this section, he has six months to prosecute an action against the personal representative if the latter breached any duty to the claimant. For example, the personal representative may be liable to a creditor if he violated the provisions of Section 3-807. The preceding section describes the fundamental liability of the distributees to unbarred claimants to the extent of the value received. The last sentence emphasizes that a personal representative who fails to disclose matters relevant to his liability in his closing statement and in the account of administration he furnished to distributees, gains no protection from the period described here. A personal representative may, however, use Section 3-1001, or, where appropriate, Section 3-1002 to secure greater protection.

       This section describes an ultimate time limit for recovery by creditors, heirs and devisees of a decedent from distributees. It is to be noted:

      <ol>
       <li id="t15c03p10s15-3-1006-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol11">
        Section 3-108 imposes a general limit of three years from death on one who must set aside an informal probate in order to establish his rights, or who must secure probate of a late-discovered will after an estate has been administered as intestate. Hence the time limit of Section 3-108 may bar one who would claim as an heir or devisee sooner than this section, although it would never cause a bar prior to three years from the decedent’s death.
       </li>
       <li id="t15c03p10s15-3-1006-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol12">
        This section would not bar recovery by a supposed decedent whose estate has been probated. See Section 3-412.
       </li>
       <li id="t15c03p10s15-3-1006-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol13">
        The limitation of this section ends the possibility of appointment of a personal representative to correct an erroneous distribution as mentioned in Sections 3-1005 and 3-1008. If there have been no adjudications under Section 3-409, or possibly 3-1001 or 3-1002, estate of the decedent which is discovered after administration has been closed may be the subject of different distribution than that attending the estate originally administered.
    The last sentence excepting actions or suits to recover property kept from one by the fraud of another may be unnecessary in view of the blanket provision concerning fraud in Article I [Chapter 1]. See Section 1-106.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In 1989, the Joint Editorial Board recommended changing the section so as to separate proceedings involving claims by claimants barred one year after decedent’s death by Section 3-803(a)(1), and other proceedings by unbarred claimants or by omitted heirs or devisees.

      <p>
       This section and the one preceding it outline a procedure which may be initiated by competent parties having beneficial interests in a decedent’s estate as a means of resolving controversy concerning the estate. If all competent persons with beneficial interests or claims which might be affected by the proposal and parents properly representing interests of their children concur, a settlement scheme differing from that otherwise governing the devolution may be substituted. The procedure for securing representation of minors and unknown or missing persons with interests must be followed. See Section 1-403. The ultimate control of the question of whether the substitute proposal shall be accepted is with the court which must find: “that the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement upon the interests of parties represented by fiduciaries is just and reasonable.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The thrust of the procedure is to put the authority for initiating settlement proposals with the persons who have beneficial interests in the estate, and to prevent executors and testamentary trustees from vetoing any such proposal. The only reason for approving a scheme of devolution which differs from that framed by the testator or the statutes governing intestacy is to prevent dissipation of the estate in wasteful litigation. Because executors and trustees may have an interest in fees and commissions which they might earn through efforts to carry out testator’s intention, the judgment of the court is substituted for that of such fiduciaries in appropriate cases. A controversy which the court may find to be in good faith, as well as concurrence of all beneficially interested and competent persons and parent-representatives provide prerequisites which should prevent the procedure from being abused. Thus, the procedure does not threaten the planning of a testator who plans and drafts with sufficient clarity and completeness to eliminate the possibility of good faith controversy concerning the meaning and legality of his plan.
    See Section 1-403 for rules governing representatives and appointment of guardians ad litem.

        The four sections which follow include two designed to facilitate transfer of small estates without use of a personal representative and two designed to simplify the duties of a personal representative, who is appointed to handle a small estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Flexible System of Administration described by earlier portions of Article III [Chapter 3] lends itself well to situations involving small estates. Letters may be obtained quickly without notice or judicial involvement. Immediately, the personal representative is in a position to distribute to successors whose deeds or transfers will protect purchasers. This route accommodates the need for quick and inexpensive transfers of land of small value as well as other assets. Consequently, it was unnecessary to frame complex provisions extending the affidavit procedures to land.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, transfers via letters of administration may prove to be less troublesome than use of the affidavit procedure. Still, it seemed desirable to provide a quick collection mechanism which avoids all necessity to visit the probate court. For one thing, unpredictable local variations in probate practice may produce situations where the alternative procedure will be very useful. For another, the provision of alternatives is in line with the overall philosophy of Article III [Chapter 3] to provide maximum flexibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Figures gleaned from a 1970 authoritative report of a major survey of probated estates in Cleveland, Ohio, demonstrate that more than one-half of all estates in probate had a gross value of less than $15,000. This means that the principal measure of the relevance of any legislation dealing with probate procedures is to be found in its impact on very small and moderate sized estates. Here is the area where probate affects most people.

        This section provides for an easy method for collecting the personal property of a decedent by affidavit prior to any formal disposition. Existing legislation generally permits the surviving widow or children to collect wages and other small amounts of liquid funds. Section 3-1201 goes further in that it allows the collection of personal property as well as money and permits any devisee or heir to make the collection. Since the appointment of a personal representative may be obtained easily under the Code, it is unnecessary to make the provisions regarding small estates applicable to realty.

      The person paying, delivering, transferring, or issuing personal property or the evidence thereof pursuant to affidavit is discharged and released to the same extent as if he dealt with a personal representative of the decedent. He is not required to see to the application of the personal property or evidence thereof or to inquire into the truth of any statement in the affidavit. If any person to whom an affidavit is delivered refuses to pay, deliver, transfer, or issue any personal property or evidence thereof, it may be recovered or its payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance compelled upon proof of their right in a proceeding brought for the purpose by or on behalf of the persons entitled thereto. Any person to whom payment, delivery, transfer or issuance is made is answerable and accountable therefor to any personal representative of the estate or to any other person having a superior right.

       <p>
        The starting point for calculating the apportionable estate is the value of the gross estate. Since the properties included and deductions allowed for determining different taxes can differ, the apportionable estate figure may not be the same for different taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Property not included in the apportionable estate for an estate tax typically will not bear any of that tax. However, the donee recipients of such property will bear part of an estate tax to the extent that the available assets of the apportionable estate are insufficient to pay the tax. See Sections 6(c) and 9(b). Since deductible transfers will not generate any estate tax, it is appropriate to insulate those transfers from the allocation of that tax to the extent that properties of the apportionable estate are sufficient.
    A gift tax paid by the decedent on a gift that was made by the decedent or the decedent’s spouse within three years of the decedent’s death is added back to the decedent’s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes by Internal Revenue Code §2035(b). A State or foreign estate tax may have a similar provision or effect. Subparagraph (1)(C) excludes any such gift tax from the apportionable estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The value of the apportionable estate is reduced by claims and expenditures that are allowable estate tax deductions whether or not allowed. For example, administrative expenses that could have been claimed as estate tax deductions, but instead are taken as income tax deductions, will reduce the apportionable estate. When a decedent’s estate includes property in more than one State, the apportionable estate for each State’s estate tax will be reduced by the expenses and claims that are deductible for purposes of that tax. Where an expenditure cannot be identified as pertaining to property in the gross estate of only one State tax, the expenditure is to be apportioned ratably among the taxes of the States in which the relevant properties are located, in accordance with the values of those properties.
       </p>
       <p>
        A spouse’s elective share of a decedent’s estate is excluded from the apportionable estate to the extent that the spouse’s share qualifies for an estate tax deduction. Other statutory claims against a decedent’s estate that do not qualify for an estate tax deduction (for example, a pretermitted heir) do not reduce the apportionable estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “estate tax” is defined in the Act to include all estate taxes and certain generation-skipping taxes arising because of an individual’s death. The term estate tax does not include any inheritance taxes, income taxes, gift taxes, or generation-skipping taxes incurred because of a taxable termination, a taxable distribution, or an inter vivos direct skip. A generation-skipping tax that is incurred because of a direct skip that takes place because of the decedent’s death is included in the term “estate tax.”

        Currently, no United States income tax is imposed on the unrealized appreciation of a decedent’s assets at the time of death. While Canada and some other foreign countries impose an income tax at death, those income taxes are not apportioned by the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some States impose an inheritance tax on recipients of property from a decedent. This Act does not apportion those taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Act does not provide for the apportionment of the income tax payable on the receipt of Income in Respect of a Decedent (IRD). If a decedent held an installment obligation the payment on which is accelerated by the decedent’s death, the income tax incurred thereby is not apportioned by the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a donor pays a gift tax during the donor’s life, the amount paid will not be part of the donor’s assets when the donor dies; and so the gift tax will not be subject to apportionment among the persons interested in the donor’s gross estate. This consequence is consistent with the typical donor’s wish that the gifts made during life pass to the donee free of any transfer tax. If all or part of a gift tax was not paid at the time of the donor’s death and is subsequently paid by the donor’s personal representative, the burden of the gift tax should lie with the same persons who would have borne it if the donor had paid it during life, typically, the residuary beneficiaries. A gift tax liability is not apportioned by this Act, but is treated the same as any other debt of the estate. A gift tax deficiency that becomes due after the decedent’s death also is treated as a debt of the decedent’s estate.
    The kinds of death benefits included in a gross estate depend upon the particular estate tax to be apportioned and may not be the same for each tax. For example, some State death taxes will have an exemption for a homestead; some will exclude life insurance proceeds and pensions. In determining the gross estate for such taxes, the property excluded from the tax will also be excluded from the gross estate for that tax. Property that is deductible under an estate tax, such as property that qualifies for a marital or charitable deduction, is nevertheless “subject to” that tax and included in the gross estate. Once the value of the gross estate for an estate tax is determined, the reductions described in Paragraph (1) are applied to ascertain the apportionable estate.

        A “time-limited interest” includes a term of years, a life interest, a life income interest, an annuity interest, an interest that is subject to a power of transfer, a unitrust interest, and similar interests, whether present or future, and whether held alone or in cotenancy. The fact that an interest that otherwise is not a time-limited interest is held in cotenancy does not make it a time-limited interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a debt is secured by more than one interest in property, the value of each such interest is the fair market value of that interest less a ratable portion of the debt that it secures.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the beneficiary of an interest in property is required by the terms of the transfer to make a payment to a third party or to pay a liability of the transferor, that obligation constitutes an encumbrance on the property, but does not necessarily reduce the value of the apportionable estate. If the obligation is to make a transfer or payment to a third party, other than an obligation to satisfy a debt of the decedent based on money or money worth’s consideration, the right of the third person constitutes an interest in the apportionable estate and so is subject to apportionment.
       </p>
       <p>
        A decedent’s direction by will or other dispositive instrument that property controlled by that instrument is to be used to pay a debt secured by an interest in property is an additional bequest to the person who is to receive the interest securing the debt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxes imposed on the transfer or receipt of property, regardless of whether a lien on the property or payable by the recipient of the property, do not reduce the value of the property for purposes of apportioning estate taxes by this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The date on which gross estate property is to be valued for federal estate tax purposes (and for some other estate tax purposes) is either the date of the decedent’s death or an alternate valuation date elected by the decedent’s personal representative pursuant to the estate tax law. An estate tax value that is determined on the alternate valuation date is not, as such, a “special valuation adjustment.” A “special valuation adjustment” refers to a reduction of the valuation of an item included in the gross estate pursuant to a provision of the estate tax law. See the Comment to Section 7.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a person has a right by contract or by the decedent’s will or other dispositive instrument to purchase gross estate property at a price below its estate tax value, the estate tax value of the property is the amount included in the value of the decedent’s gross estate. The difference or discount between the purchase price and the estate tax value of the property can be viewed as an interest which the decedent passed to that person. If the right to purchase is exercised, the amount of the discount is the value of that person’s interest in the apportionable estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The value of a person’s interest in the apportionable estate can depend upon the value of the apportionable estate. So, the value of a residuary interest in a decedent’s estate will reflect the amount of allowable deductions which, under this Act, reduce the apportionable estate, but will not be reduced by expenditures that are not allowable deductions for that estate tax. The formula for allocating estate taxes in Section 4(1) utilizes a fraction of which the numerator is the value of a person’s interest in the apportionable estate rather than the value of the person’s interest in the net estate or in the taxable estate. Since the denominator of the fraction is the value of the apportionable estate, the sum of the numerators of all persons having an interest in the apportionable estate will equal the denominator, and so 100% of the estate taxes will be apportioned. Consider the following example.
    Ex. D died leaving a gross estate with a value of $10,150,000 and made no provision for apportionment of taxes. D’s will made pecuniary devises totaling $1,000,000, and gave the residue to A and B equally. There are no claims against the estate and no marital or charitable deductions are allowable. The funeral expenses are $10,000, and the estate incurred administrative expenses of $240,000 of which, while all were allowed as administrative expenses by the State probate court, $100,000 was disallowed by the Service for a federal estate tax deduction on the ground that $100,000 of the expenses was not necessary for the administration of the estate. See Rev. Rul. 77-461 and TAM 7912006. The personal representative elected to deduct the remaining $140,000 of administrative expenses as a federal estate tax deduction. For federal estate tax purposes, the apportionable estate is equal to the difference between the gross estate ($10,150,000) and the allowable deductions of $150,000 ($140,000 deductible administrative expenses and $10,000 deductible funeral expenses); and so the apportionable estate is $10,000,000. The value of the two residuary beneficiaries’ interests in the apportionable estate is equal to the difference between the entire apportionable estate of $10,000,000 and the $1,000,000 that was devised to the pecuniary beneficiaries. While the residuary beneficiaries will not receive any part of the $100,000 of administrative expenses for which no federal estate tax deduction is allowable, that expense does not reduce the gross estate in determining the apportionable estate, and so does not affect the value of their residuary interests for the purpose of apportioning the federal estate tax. So, for purposes of apportioning the federal estate taxes, each residuary beneficiary has an interest in the apportionable estate valued at $4,500,000, which constitutes 45% of the apportionable estate of $10,000,000. Forty-five percent of the federal estate taxes is apportioned each to A and B, and 10% of the federal estate taxes is apportioned to the pecuniary beneficiaries.

       <p>
        A decedent’s direction will not control the apportionment of taxes unless it explicitly refers to the payment of an estate tax and is specific and unambiguous as to the direction it makes for that payment. For example, a testamentary direction that “all debts and expenses of and claims against me or my estate are to be paid out of the residuary of my probate estate” is not an express direction for the payment of estate taxes and will not control apportionment. While an estate tax is a claim against the estate, a will’s direction for payment of claims that does not explicitly mention estate taxes is likely to be a boiler plate that was written with no intention of controlling tax apportionment. To protect against an inadvertent inclusion of estate tax payment in a general provision of that nature, the Act requires that the direction explicitly mention estate taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, a direction in a will that “all taxes arising as a result of my death, whether attributable to assets passing under this will or otherwise, be paid out of the residue of my probate estate” satisfies the Act’s requirement for an explicit mention of estate taxes and is specific and unambiguous as to what properties are to bear the payment of those taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether other directions of a decedent that explicitly mention estate taxes comply with the Act’s requirement that they be specific and unambiguous is a matter for judicial construction. For example, there is a split among judicial decisions as to whether a direction such as “all estate taxes be paid out of the residue of my estate” is ambiguous because it is unclear whether it is intended to apply to taxes attributable to nonprobate assets. To the extent that it is determined that a decedent failed to apportion an estate tax, then the Act will apply to apportion that amount of the tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        If an amendment is made to a revocable trust instrument, and if the amendment itself contains an express and unambiguous provision apportioning an estate tax, the date of the amendment is the date of the revocable trust instrument. However, if an amendment to a revocable trust instrument does not contain an express and unambiguous provision apportioning an estate tax, the date of the revocable trust instrument is the date on which it was executed or the date of the most recent amendment containing an express and unambiguous provision apportioning an estate tax. An express and unambiguous provision apportioning an estate tax includes a provision directing that payment of an estate tax be made from specified property.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory apportionment rules of the Act are default rules applicable to the extent that the decedent does not make a valid provision as to how estate taxes are to be apportioned. The decedent has the power to determine which recipients of decedent’s property will bear the estate taxes and in what proportion. If provisions conflict, it is necessary to determine which prevails. A possible choice would permit the directions in each of decedent’s instruments determine the extent to which property controlled by that instrument bears a share of estate taxes, but having the provisions for an allocation scheme scattered among a number of documents would make decedent’s personal representative search multiple instruments to ascertain the decedent’s directions. Instead, the Act provides an order of priority for a decedent’s provisions for estate tax allocations. To the extent that a decedent makes an express and unambiguous provision by will, that provision will trump any competing provision in another instrument. To the extent that the will does not expressly and unambiguously provide for the allocation of some estate taxes, an express and unambiguous provision in a revocable trust instrument will control. If the decedent executed more than one revocable trust instrument, the express provisions in the instrument that was executed most recently will control. In determining which revocable trust instrument was executed most recently, the date of any amendment containing an express and unambiguous apportionment provision will be taken into account. In the event that the allocation of estate taxes is not fully provided for by the decedent’s will or revocable trust instrument, an express and unambiguous provision in other instruments executed by the decedent controls to the extent that the provision applies to the property disposed of in that instrument. An example of a provision in an instrument disposing of property, other than a will or revocable trust instrument, is a provision in a designation of a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds either that the proceeds will or will not be used to pay a portion of estate taxes. A designation of that form will be honored if there is no conflicting valid provision in a will or revocable trust instrument.
    A provision in decedent’s will, revocable trust, or other instrument will not be honored to the extent that it would contravene subsection (c).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exclusivity of the provisions of this section apply only to apportionment rules; they do not prevent a dispositive instrument from making additional gifts; nor do they prevent a governing instrument of an entity from rearranging the internal division of the assets of that entity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ex.(1). On D’s death, her will apportioned $100,000 of estate taxes to the holders of interests in the D Family Trust, an irrevocable trust created by D during her life. The D Family Trust is divided into two separate shares: the William Share, and the Franklin Share, each of which is for a different child of D. The William Share is for the benefit of William, and the Franklin Share is for the benefit of Franklin. The trust instrument provides that any taxes apportioned to the holders of interests in the trust or to any share of the trust are to be paid from the William Share. The effect of that trust provision is to require that taxes reduce the size of the William Share and do not reduce the Franklin Share. The apportionment provision in D’s will established the amount of estate tax that the trust must bear; the amount apportioned to the D Family Trust makes all of the assets of that trust liable for that amount. Since the decedent’s will did not direct how the trust’s burden should be allocated between the two shares of the trust, the direction in the trust instrument is not inconsistent with the will provision and so can control the allocation of taxes between properties disposed of in the trust instrument under subsection (c). Even if the direction in the trust instrument were deemed not to be permitted by subsection (c), the direction would be effective as a disposition of trust assets as explained in Example (2).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ex. (2). The same facts as those stated in Ex. (1) except that D’s will apportioned the $100,000 of estate taxes to the Franklin Share of the D Family Trust. The trust provision placing the burden of the tax on the William Share cannot qualify as an apportionment direction since it is in conflict with the will provision allocating all of the trust’s share of the estate tax to the Franklin Share. But the settlor has the power to direct trust assets to whomever the settlor pleases. The direction in the trust instrument that assets of the William Share are to be used to pay any taxes apportioned to the Franklin Share is a gift to Franklin of assets from the William Share. The direction is valid as a provision shifting trust assets from the William Share to the Franklin Share, which is a permissible disposition of a trust instrument.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal estate tax laws enable a decedent’s personal representative to collect a portion of the decedent’s federal estate tax from the recipients of certain nonprobate property that is included in the decedent’s gross estate. See e.g., §§2206 to 2207B of the Internal Revenue Code. There is a conflict among the courts as to whether those federal provisions preempt a State law apportionment provision. Choosing the position that there is no federal preemption, the Act apportions taxes without regard to the federal provisions. The federal provisions are not apportionment statutes; rather, they simply empower the personal representative to collect a portion of the estate tax that is attributable to the property included in the decedent’s gross estate and do not direct use of the collected amounts by the personal representative. The rights granted to the personal representative by federal law for the collection of assets from nonprobate beneficiaries do not conflict either with the apportionment of taxes by State law or with other rights of collection granted by State law. Since there is no conflict, this Act does not include a direction as to whether federal or State law takes priority.
    The Act does not permit anyone other than the decedent to override the allocation provisions of the Act. For example, if X created a QTIP trust for Y, the value of the trust assets will be included in Y’s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes on Y’s death. See §2044 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If X’s QTIP trust provided that the trust is not to bear any of the estate taxes imposed at Y’s death, the direction would be ineffective under the Act because only Y can direct apportionment of taxes on Y’s estate. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the right granted to a decedent’s estate by §2207A of the Internal Revenue Code to collect a share of the federal estate tax from a QTIP included in the decedent’s gross estate can be waived only by direction of the decedent in a will or revocable trust instrument. Y is in the best position to determine the optimum allocation of Y’s estate taxes among the various assets that comprise Y’s gross estate. If Y fails to make an allocation, the default provisions of the Act are more likely to reflect Y’s intentions than would a direction of a third person.
       </p>
       <p>
        If an instrument transferring property that may be included in the taxable estate of someone other than the transferor directs payment from the transferred property of any part of the estate taxes of the other person, the direction affects the size of the gift, and so is a dispositive rather than an apportionment provision, and is not subject to this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a decedent makes a valid direction that a person receiving property under a particular disposition is exonerated from payment of an estate tax, the tax that would have been borne by that person will, instead, be borne by other persons receiving interests under the instrument directing the exoneration. Thus, if several assets are disposed of by a governing instrument, which exonerates one or more of those assets from bearing an estate tax, the exoneration will not reduce the amount of estate tax to be allocated to all of the assets disposed of by that instrument, including the exonerated assets. For example, if decedent’s will directs that all federal estate taxes attributable to decedent’s probate estate be paid from the residuary of his estate, the exoneration of the pre-residuary devises will not affect the total amount of federal estate tax apportioned to the beneficiaries of the probate estate, all of which tax will be borne by the residuary beneficiaries if the residuary is sufficient. If the value of the other interests is insufficient to pay the estate taxes, the difference will be payable by other persons receiving interests in the apportionable estate that are not exonerated from apportionment of the tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a decedent directs that estate taxes be paid from properties, some of which qualify for a marital or charitable deduction, the provision making that direction may designate the extent to which the charitable or marital interests will or will not bear a portion of the tax. If the decedent makes no provision as to whether the marital or charitable interests bear a portion of the tax, the Act provides a default rule that exempts the marital or charitable interests from payment of the tax to the extent that it is feasible to do so. An example of when this circumstance arises is when the decedent’s will makes a residuary devise, a portion of which qualifies for a marital or charitable deduction and a portion of which does not. If the decedent provides that estate taxes are to be paid from the residuary, unless directed otherwise, the default provision of the Act will require the payment to be made first from the nondeductible interests in the residuary. The default rule does not apply to an allocation of tax to a holder of an interest in property in which there is a time-limited interest; the tax allocated to any interest in that property is to be paid from the principal of the property unless the decedent expressly directed otherwise or unless Section 7 applies to the property.
    If a decedent created a trust during life the value of which is included in the decedent’s gross estate at death, if immediately after decedent’s death, there were one or more time-limited interests in the trust that did not qualify for an estate tax deduction, and if one or more charities held a remainder interest in the trust that otherwise qualified for an estate tax charitable deduction, the charitable deduction for the remainder interests may be lost if the estate taxes generated by the nondeductible time-limited interests are to be paid from assets in the trust. See Rev. Rul. 82-128, Rev. Proc. 90-30 (§§ 4 and 5), and Rev. Proc. 90-31 (§§ 5 and 6). It is possible that if the payment of an estate tax is made from funds that, while directed to be added to the trust’s assets, had not been distributed to the trust before payment of the estate tax, the payment will not disqualify the charitable deduction. There are numerous instances in which estate taxes are required to be paid from a charitable remainder trust that was created inter vivos. Subsection (b)(4) is an attempt to protect the deduction in such cases by establishing a rule of construction requiring that funds directed to be added to the trust be used to pay any required estate tax before assets already in the trust itself are used. It seems unlikely that a decedent would wish to negate this construction of decedent’s direction, but the decedent has the power to do so by including an express statement to that effect in a will or revocable trust instrument.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a decedent had made an irrevocable transfer during his life, over which the decedent did not retain a power to make a subsequent transfer, and if that transfer is included in the decedent’s gross estate for estate tax purposes, a portion of the estate tax will be apportioned to the transferee unless the decedent effectively provides otherwise in a will, revocable trust or other instrument. While, by an express provision in the appropriate instrument, a decedent can reduce the amount of tax apportioned to such inter vivos transfers, the decedent is not permitted to increase the amount of tax apportioned to such a transferee. If a decedent attempts to do so, whether directly by apportioning more estate tax to the inter vivos transfer or indirectly by insulating some person interested in the gross estate from all or part of that person’s share of the estate tax, the amount of estate tax that is apportioned to the transferee of an irrevocable inter vivos transfer will not be greater than the amount that would have been apportioned to that transferee if the decedent had made no provision for apportionment in another instrument.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) does not apply to a decedent’s provision that no estate tax be apportioned to the recipient of an interest who would be excluded from apportionment by this Act in the absence of a contrary direction by the decedent. For example, a decedent’s provision that no estate tax be apportioned to the recipient of property that qualifies for a marital or charitable deduction is not subject to subsection (c).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a decedent transferred property to a revocable trust prior to executing a will that directs the apportionment of taxes to that trust, the apportionment direction will be valid even if the decedent subsequently released the power of revocation so that the trust became irrevocable prior to the decedent’s death. In such a case, Subsection (c) does not invalidate the will’s direction.
       </p>
       <p>
        If, immediately before the decedent’s death, the decedent had a power of appointment, whether inter vivos or testamentary, the decedent had the power to transfer the property interest within the meaning of this provision.

        The value of an interest in the apportionable estate is determined in accordance with Section 2(7) of the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Property values subtracted from the decedent’s gross estate in determining the apportionable estate under Section 2(1) are excluded from the apportionable estate, and beneficiaries of those properties do not have any estate tax apportioned to them because of their interest in those properties. This treatment is consistent with the Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers §1.1, comment g (1998). The Act adopts a method of equitable apportionment of estate taxes, but does not follow the Restatement method which allocates taxes apportioned to probate assets first to the residuary beneficiaries and invites preferential treatment for beneficiaries of specific and pecuniary gifts by will over beneficiaries of gifts by various non-probate transfer methods.
    A “direct skip” is defined in §§ 2612(c) and 2613 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2603(b) of the Internal Revenue Code states that, unless directed otherwise in the governing instrument, the tax on a generation-skipping transfer is charged to the property constituting the transfer. Section 2603(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes the duty of paying the tax on a direct skip on the transferor of the property. Under paragraph (2), the decedent’s personal representative will pay the generation-skipping tax on a direct skip out of the transferred property (or the proceeds from a sale of all or some of that property). To the extent that it is not feasible or practical to pay the tax from the transferred property, the transferees are to pay their proportionate share of the shortfall. Paragraph (2) is consistent with the treatment provided by federal law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The property to which paragraph (3) applies is sometimes referred to as “QTIP property” since § 2044 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 deals with “qualified terminable interest property.” See §§ 2044(b)(1), 2056(b)(7), and 2523(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Although the general rule of apportionment in the Act is to apportion estate taxes on the basis of the average rate of tax, the tax apportioned to the holders of interests in QTIP property by the Act is based on the marginal rate of tax. Note that federal estate tax law grants the decedent’s fiduciary the power to collect from the holders of the QTIP property the estate tax generated by that property at the marginal estate tax rate of the decedent’s estate. The Act tracks the federal law in this respect.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be harsh to collect the estate tax from persons holding discretionary or contingent interests in property since they may not obtain possession for many years, if at all. Hence, when the tax is apportioned to persons holding interests in property in which there are time-limited interests, paragraph (4) requires the tax to be paid from principal. This provision does not apply to property for which a special elective benefit (as described in Section 7) has been elected.
       </p>
       <p>
        An estate tax that is apportioned to an interest in property that cannot be reached because of legal or practical obstacles but is not subject to a time-limited interest is to be collected from the interest holder to the extent feasible. In that circumstance, since there is no time-limited interest, the tax will not be apportioned to a person who may not receive property for many years if at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        When some of the interests in property qualify for a charitable or marital deduction and some do not, requiring the tax to be paid from the principal of the property may reduce the amount of marital or charitable deduction that is allowable. Although the likely intent of a decedent would be to maximize the marital and charitable deductions available for the estate, paragraph (4) provides that the estate tax is to be paid from the principal of the property, a choice that avoids administrative complexity.

       Section 2013 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows a credit for federal estate taxes paid on certain properties that were included in the taxable estate of a person who died within a relatively short time of the decedent’s death. This credit often is referred to as a credit for property previously taxed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A beneficiary of property attracting a foreign or State death tax may have paid that tax directly or may have paid it indirectly by virtue of the tax’s being paid out of the property passing to that person. If that occurs, while the beneficiary’s payment of the foreign or State tax reduces the amount that the beneficiary will receive, it will not reduce the value of the beneficiary’s interest in the apportionable estate according to the definition of “value” in this Act. See Section 2(7). The Act mitigates the beneficiary’s burden by giving the beneficiary the benefit of any estate tax credit allowed for the foreign or State tax and paid by the beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefits and burdens described in paragraph (3) are to be allocated ratably among persons in accordance with the amount of deferral or extension attributable to their interests in the apportionable estate.

      <p>
       The term “time-limited interest” is defined in Section 2(6) [§ 15-3-1302(f)].
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) applies to property in which at least one person has a time-limited interest and which property can be reached by the personal representative of the decedent. In such cases, an estate tax that is payable as an advanced tax under subsection (c), is charged against the principal of the property, and is not apportioned among the several interests in that property. While there is no express apportionment of the advanced tax to the time-limited interests in the property, the holders of the time-limited interests will bear a share of the tax burden in that the resulting reduction of the value of the principal will reduce the value of the time-limited interests, except that it will not reduce the value of a dollar annuity interest. So, the holder of a dollar annuity interest will be exonerated from sharing in the burden of estate taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the estate tax apportioned to the owners of insulated property cannot be collected from the property, the tax is to be paid (as an advancement) by persons having interests in other assets of the estate (uninsulated holders), provided however that the total tax attributed to and advanced by an uninsulated holder cannot exceed the value of that person’s interest in the uninsulated property. See Section 9(d). If the amount of the aggregate tax apportioned to and to be advanced by an uninsulated holder exceeds the value of that holder’s interest in the uninsulated property, then the deficiency shall be apportioned to the holders of interests in properties that otherwise qualify for charitable or marital deductions. In such cases, those charitable and marital properties are reclassified as uninsulated properties, and so the beneficiaries of those properties will be uninsulated holders who will have a right of recovery from the distributees of insulated properties for which they paid a portion of the estate tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be harsh to make persons holding future interests in insulated property pay tax on properties that they will not receive until years later and may never receive. If they were required to pay the tax at the time of decedent’s death, that could give rise to widespread disclaimers of interests. Also, it would be difficult to value the interests of discretionary beneficiaries. For that reason, with one exception set forth in subsection (d), the tax attributable to insulated properties is reallocated to uninsulated holders who are required to advance the funds to pay the tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tax attributable to the insulated property that is required to be paid by the uninsulated holders is referred to as an “advanced tax.” To permit the uninsulated holders who bear the advanced tax to be reimbursed, the Act effectively provides the uninsulated holders with a phantom percentage interest in the property whose transfer is the source of the advanced tax. While the phantom percentage interest of the uninsulated holder remains constant, its value will increase or decrease as the value of the property changes. The phantom percentage interest is determined by dividing the advanced tax by the aggregate value of insulated properties as determined for purposes of the estate tax. When a distribution of insulated property is made, a percentage of that distribution must be paid over to the uninsulated holders; and this is a personal obligation of the distributee. If it were not for this Section, the uninsulated holders would have had a right of reimbursement under Section 10 for the amount of their outlay from the distributees; but instead, subsection (e) gives them a right to a fraction of the distributed amount rather than to a fixed dollar amount. The amount collected from a distributee is divided among the uninsulated holders according to the percentage of the advanced tax that they paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that the uninsulated holders do not have an actual interest in the insulated property and have no lien or security interest in that property while it is in the possession of the trust or fund. The uninsulated holders only have a claim against the persons who receive distributions from the trust or fund which holds the insulated property. The only exception is where previously insulated property loses its insulation so that it can be reached by the uninsulated holders without violating any prohibition against alienation of interests. Once insulated property is in the hands of a distributee, subsection (f) permits the uninsulated holders to seek a lien on the distributee’s property for the amount owed to them; but there is no lien or other encumbrance on the insulated property while it is in the possession of the trust or fund.
    The operation of this Section is illustrated in the following examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ex. (1) X dies having a gross estate and an apportionable estate of $10M and devises his probate property (with a value of $8M) to A, B and C, with A and B each receiving 40% of the probate estate, and C receiving 20%. In addition to the probate property, X had an interest in a nonqualified pension plan at his death which interest had a value of $2M. X’s contract with the plan provides that an annuity of $120,000 per year is to be paid to G for life, and upon G’s death the remainder of the corpus is to be paid to L. The only estate tax to which X’s estate is subject is the federal estate tax. The federal estate tax on X’s $10M gross estate is $4M. So, the average rate of the estate tax is 40%. Under Section 4(1), the estate tax that is attributable to the $2M pension fund is $800,000 — the value of the property interests that G and L hold in the fund ($2M) is 20% of the $10M value of the entire apportionable estate, and so 20% of the $4M estate tax is attributable to the pension fund. Assume that under local law, the assets of the pension fund cannot be reached by creditors or by the personal representative of X’s estate in order to use those funds to pay estate taxes. Under Subsection (c), the personal representative will collect 40% of the $800,000 (i.e., $320,000) from A and a like amount from B; and the personal representative will collect $160,000 from C.
      </p>
      <p>
       The advanced fraction for the pension fund is $800,000 (the amount of the estate tax that was advanced by A, B, and C) divided by the $2M value of the fund (the insulated property), which division results in a percentage of 40%. Putting it differently, the $800,000 estate tax attributable to the fund but not paid by those interested in the fund constitutes 40% of the $2M value of the fund. To compensate A, B and C for paying the advanced tax, they obtain what amounts to a 40% phantom interest in the fund. Their actual interest arises only when distributions are made from the fund or, in the event that the fund loses its insulation from creditors, when that occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Year One, the fund pays $120,000 to G pursuant to the terms of the contract. Forty percent of that distribution ($48,000) must be paid by G to A, B and C — 40% or $19,200 payable to A and another $19,200 payable to B, and 20% or $9,600 payable to C, since that is the proportion in which they bore the advanced tax. The next year, the fund distributes another $120,000 to G, and the same payments must be made to A, B and C. In the third year, G dies, and the fund distributes the remaining principal of $2,400,000 to L; the value of the principal had increased because of an increase in the value of the investments the fund held. A, B, and C are entitled to 40% of that $2,400,000, and so L must pay them $960,000, to be divided among them. A and B will each receive $384,000 (40% of the $960,000), and C will receive $192,000 (20% of $960,000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ex. (2) X dies leaving a taxable estate of $10,000,000 on which a federal estate tax of $5,000,000 is payable (for convenience of computation, we treat all of X’s estate as subject to a tax at a 50% marginal rate). X’s estate has no marital or charitable deductions. X left $4,000,000 of assets in an offshore trust that cannot be reached by X’s personal representative and so constitutes insulated property. The federal estate tax attributable to that property is $2,000,000. X had other nonprobate assets having an aggregate value of $2,000,000 and a residuary estate of $4,000,000. The holders of the nonprobate assets will have $1,000,000 in federal estate taxes apportioned to them, and the holders of the residuary interests will have $2,000,000 of federal estate taxes attributed to them. But, the personal representative must also pay the $2,000,000 of federal estate taxes attributable to the offshore assets. If the holders of interests in those assets cannot be reached, and if the Act did not apply, the personal representative would have to pay the $2,000,000 from the residuary of the estate, thereby wiping it out completely. Under the Act, a of the $2,000,000 of federal estate tax attributable to the offshore assets ($666,667) will be paid by the holders of the other nonprobate assets, and the remaining $1,333,333 of that tax will be paid by the beneficiaries of the residuary estate. Under the Act, the holders of the other nonprobate assets will have to bear their proportionate share of the tax on the offshore assets. When distributions are made of the offshore assets, the distributees will be personally liable to pay a portion of their distribution to the persons who paid the estate tax on the offshore fund.
    If undistributed insulated property loses its insulation from claims, the uninsulated holders can collect the balance of their interest from the property at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In certain circumstances, it would be more equitable to require the beneficiary of an interest in insulated property to bear the tax on that interest than to reapportion it to others. For example, if the beneficiary’s interest is one that will become possessory in a short period of time, so that the beneficiary will soon have possession of assets from the fund or trust, it would be more equitable to place personal liability on that beneficiary; and the court has discretion to do so. In determining whether a beneficiary is likely to obtain possession of all or a significant part of the beneficiary’s interest in the insulated property, the court can consider not only distributions that are required to be made to the beneficiary, but also distributions that, based on an examination of the history of the administration of the fund or trust, are likely to be made in the near future. Subsection (d) provides the court with the discretion to make that determination. While a beneficiary’s receipt of a distribution from the trust or fund would make that beneficiary liable to uninsulated holders who paid the advanced tax, that places a burden of collection on the uninsulated holders; and so, when the distribution is likely to be made to a beneficiary within a short period of time, it would be more equitable to have that beneficiary bear the tax.

       The types of special elective benefits at which this provision is aimed are currently set forth in §§ 2031(c), 2032A, and 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 2032A provides an election whereby “qualified real property” (real property that is used for a specified purpose and is held by certain parties related to the decedent) will be given a lower valuation for federal estate tax purposes than otherwise would have been true. Under § 2032A(c), if within 10 years after the decedent’s death the qualified heir disposes of an interest in the qualified realty or ceases to use it for its required purpose, an additional estate tax will be imposed to recapture some of the estate tax reduction that was obtained through the election. The purpose of this Section is to define how the benefit of an estate tax reduction of this or a similar type will be allocated and how any additional estate tax imposed to recapture some of that tax benefit will be allocated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another federal estate tax provision to which this Section applies is § 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. That provision grants an election to receive a special estate tax deduction for a “qualified family-owned business interest.” Under § 2057(f), if, within 10 years after the decedent’s death, one of four listed events occurs, an additional federal estate tax will be imposed in order to recapture some of the tax reduction obtained by electing to take the deduction. This Section defines how the benefits of the election and the burden of an additional tax will be apportioned. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 repealed § 2057 for the estates of decedent’s dying after the year 2003. However, the 2001 Act retains the 10-year recapture provision, and the sunset provision will reinstate § 2057 in the year 2011 unless the repeal is made permanent.
    Section 2031(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides an election whereby a portion of the value of land that is subject to a qualified conservation easement, as defined in § 2031(c)(8), is excluded from the gross estate. The exclusion does not apply to the value of a retained development right; but if, prior to the date for filing the estate tax return, all the persons who have an interest in the land execute an agreement to extinguish some or all of the development rights, an additional estate tax deduction will be allowed by § 2031(c)(5). A failure to implement that agreement within a specified time will cause the imposition of an additional estate tax to recapture that deduction. The allocation of the benefits of the exclusion and of the deduction for making the agreement, and the allocation of any additional estate tax, is determined by this Section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The allocation of the aggregate tax reduction obtained from all special elective benefits is made among the holders of interests in the specified properties in accordance with the reduction of the decedent’s taxable estate that is attributable to each holder’s interest. Since the determination of the amount of estate tax benefit is made by applying the marginal rate of estate tax to the reduced value of the gross estate, it is necessary to aggregate the tax reduction obtained from all of the special election benefits so that the greater tax reduction obtained from using a marginal rate is not duplicated by applying that rate to several distinct reductions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the amount of estate tax that is apportioned to the holder of an interest in specified property is determined, it will have to be paid. The holders of interests in a specified property may have difficulty paying that tax. To pay the tax, the holders will have to sell the property, borrow against it, use other funds to pay the tax, or defer the payment of the tax under tax deferral provisions and pay the tax in installments with income produced by the property. If they were to sell the property, the special elective benefit would be lost; so a sale is not a viable option. Accordingly, the requirement of Sections 3(b)(3), 4(4), and 6(b) that the estate tax or an advanced tax be paid from the principal of property subject to a time-limited interest does not apply to properties for which an election for a special elective benefit is made. The solution chosen in Section 6(c) and (e) of having other persons interested in the apportionable estate pay the tax and then collect reimbursement from distributees of the property is not practical here because there would be difficulty in determining what income was derived from the property itself, and there would be no trustee or other fiduciary to see that the amounts were turned over to the persons who paid the tax. So, that approach was not adopted. Instead, Sections 4(1) and this section apportion the estate tax to the holders of the interests in the properties who, facing the obligation to pay, can determine the best method for obtaining the funds to make that payment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If additional estate taxes are imposed to recapture some or all of a special elective benefit, Section 7 follows the allocation of liability imposed by the estate tax law that generated the additional tax. The burden of the additional estate tax will be borne by the persons who hold interests in the specified property at the time that the additional tax payment is made, and those persons may not be the same ones who held the specified property when the special elective benefit was allowed and so derived the benefit of that election.

       If a fiduciary is unable to collect from a person the estate tax apportioned to that person or to be advanced by that person, the fiduciary is authorized to collect the deficiency from any person interested in the apportionable estate whose interest is not exonerated from tax apportionment. The fiduciary is not obliged to collect the deficiency ratably from such persons. At the fiduciary’s discretion, the fiduciary is authorized to collect all of the deficiency from one person or from several persons in any proportion that the fiduciary chooses. The reason that the fiduciary is not required to collect a deficiency ratably is that the payment of the estate tax should not be delayed because of difficulties in collecting from a number of persons.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the amount collected from persons whose interests in the apportionable estate is not exonerated from tax apportionment is insufficient to make up the deficiency, the fiduciary can then collect any remaining deficiency from persons interested in the apportionable estate whose interests are exonerated from tax apportionment. This class excludes persons holding interests in property that qualified for a marital or charitable deduction since those interests are excluded from the apportionable estate. Again, the fiduciary is not required to collect the remaining deficiency ratably from the persons holding exonerated interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if the amount collected from persons holding exonerated interests is insufficient, the fiduciary can collect the balance from persons holding interests that qualify for a marital or charitable deduction. The fiduciary is not required to make that collection ratably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who pays more than his share of an estate tax or an advanced tax has a ratable right of reimbursement from those who did not pay their share. If requested, the fiduciary may assist in collecting that reimbursement.

       <p>
        This Article [Chapter] concerns the law applicable in estate problems which involve more than a single state. It covers the powers and responsibilities in the adopting state of personal representatives appointed in other states.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some provisions of the code covering local appointment of personal representatives for non-residents appear in Article III [Chapter 3]. These include the following: Sections 3-201 (venue), 3-202 (resolution of conflicting claims regarding domicile), 3-203 (priority as personal representative of representative previously appointed at domicile), 3-307(a) (30 days delay required before appointment of a local representative for a non-resident), 3-803(a) (claims barred by non-claim at domicile before local administration commenced are barred locally) and 3-815 (duty of personal representative in regard to claims where estate is being administered in more than one state). See also Sections 3-308, 3-611(a) and 3-816. Also, see Section 4-207.
    The recognition provisions contained in Article IV [Chapter 4] and the various provisions of Article III [Chapter 3] which relate to administration of estates of non-residents are designed to coerce respect for domiciliary procedures and administrative acts to the extent possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first part of Article IV [Chapter 4] contains some definitions of particular relevance to estates located in two or more states.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second part of Article IV [Chapter 4] deals with the powers of foreign personal representatives in a jurisdiction adopting the Uniform Probate Code. There are different types of power which may be exercised. First, a foreign personal representative has the power under Section 4-201 to receive payments of debts owed to the decedent or to accept delivery of property belonging to the decedent. The foreign personal representative provides an affidavit indicating the date of death of the nonresident decedent, that no local administration has been commenced and that the foreign personal representative is entitled to payment or delivery. Payment under this provision can be made any time more than 60 days after the death of the decedent. When made in good faith the payment operates as a discharge of the debtor. A protection for local creditors of the decedent is provided in Section 4-203, under which local debtors of the non-resident decedent can be notified of the claims which local creditors have against the estate. This notification will prevent payment under this provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        A second type of power is provided in Sections 4-204 to 4-206. Under these provisions a foreign personal representative can file with the appropriate court a copy of his appointment and official bond if he has one. Upon so filing, the foreign personal representative has all of the powers of a personal representative appointed by the local court. This would be all of the powers provided for in an unsupervised administration as provided in Article III [Chapter 3] of the Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third type of power which may be obtained by a foreign personal representative is conferred by the priority the domiciliary personal representative enjoys in respect to local appointment. This is covered by Section 3-203. Also, see Section 3-611(b).
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 3 provides for power in the local court over foreign personal representatives who act locally. If a local or ancillary administration has been started, provisions in Article III [Chapter 3] subject the appointee to the power of the court. See Section 3-602. In Part 3 of this Article [Chapter], it is provided that a foreign personal representative submits himself to the jurisdiction of the local court by filing a copy of his appointment to get the powers provided in Section 4-205 or by doing any act which would give the state jurisdiction over him as an individual. In addition, the collection of funds as provided in Section 4-201 gives the court quasi-in-rem jurisdiction over the foreign personal representative to the extent of the funds collected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, Section<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.04.html#t04c03s4-303" target="_blank">4-303</a></cite> [4-302] provides that the foreign personal representative is subject to the jurisdiction of the local court “to the same extent that his decedent was subject to jurisdiction immediately prior to death.” This is similar to the typical non-resident motorist provision that provides for jurisdiction over the personal representative of a deceased non-resident motorist, see Note, 44 Iowa L. Rev. 384 (1959). It is, however, a much broader provision. Section 4-304 [4-303] provides for the mechanical steps to be taken in serving the foreign personal representatives.

       <p>
        <p class="">
    Part 4 of the Article [Chapter] deals with the res judicata effect to be given adjudications for or against a foreign personal representative. Any such adjudication is to be conclusive on a local personal representative “unless it resulted from fraud or collusion . . . to the prejudice of the estate.” This provision must be read with Section 3-408 which deals with certain out-of-state findings concerning a decedent’s estate. [Comment to<cite class="id_code">§ 15-4</cite>-101.]

       <p>
        Section 1-201 includes definitions of “foreign personal representatives,” “personal representative” and “non-resident decedent.”

      Article V [Chapter 5], entitled “Protection of Persons Under Disability and Their Property” embodies separate systems of guardianship to protect persons of minors and mental incompetents. It also includes provisions for a type of power of attorney that does not terminate on disability of the principal which may be used by adults approaching senility or incompetence to avoid the necessity for other kinds of protective regimes. Finally, Part 4 of the Article [Chapter] offers a system of protective proceedings, including conservatorships, to provide for the management of substantial aggregations of property of persons who are, for one reason or another, including minority and mental incompetence, unable to manage their own property.
    It should be emphasized that the Article [Chapter] contains many provisions designed to minimize or avoid the necessity of guardianship and protective proceedings, as well as provisions designed to simplify and minimize arrangements which become necessary for care of persons or their property. The power of attorney which confers authority notwithstanding later incompetence is one example of the former. Another is a facility of payment provision which permits relatively small sums owed to a minor to be paid whether or not there is a guardian or other official who has been designated to act for the minor. A new device tending to simplify necessary protective proceedings, is found in provisions in Part 4 which permit a judge to make appropriate orders concerning the property of a disabled person without appointing a fiduciary.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The highspots of the several parts of Article V [Chapter 5], considered in somewhat more detail, include the following:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t15c05p01s15-5-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTaVol1a">
       The facility of payment clause, which is Section 5-103 in Part 1, permits one owing up to $5,000 per year to a minor to be validly discharged by payment to the minor, if he is over eighteen or married, to the minor’s parent or grandparent or other adult with whom the minor resides, to a guardian, or by deposit in an account in the name of the minor.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p01s15-5-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTaVol1b">
       A provision in Part 2 permits the surviving parent of a minor to designate a guardian by will. A similar provision in Part 3 authorizes a parent or spouse to designate a guardian for an incapacitated person by will. Such designation becomes effective upon probate of the will and the filing of an acceptance by the guardian. Thereafter the status of guardian and ward arises. It is like guardianship of the person, rather than of estate. It is described as a parental relationship without the parental obligation of support. The relationship follows the guardian and ward and is properly recognized and implemented, as and when necessary, by the courts of any jurisdiction where these persons may be located. No requirement of periodic reports or accounts is imposed on a testamentary guardian. The question of his proper expenditure of the small sums which he may receive for the ward is left to be settled by the guardian and ward after the ward attains full age. If the amounts involved becomes more than the guardian cares to be responsible for on this basis, he or any other interested person may seek the appointment of a property manager who is called a “conservator” by the Code. The guardian may be eligible to be appointed to this position.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p01s15-5-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTaVol1c">
       A parent or guardian is permitted to delegate his authority for short periods as necessitated by anticipated absence or incapacity.
      </li>

       As previously mentioned, Part 4 of the Article [Chapter] deals with protective proceedings designed to permit substantial property interests of minors and others unable properly to manage their own affairs to be controlled by court order or managed by a conservator appointed by the court. The causes for inability of owner-management that are listed by the statute are quite broad. Technical incompetency is but one of several reasons why one may be unable to manage his affairs. See Section 5-401 (2) [15-5-401(b)]. The draftsmen’s view was that reliance should be placed on the fact that the court applying the statute would be a full power court and on the various procedural safeguards, including a right to jury trial, to protect against unwise use of the proceedings, rather than to attempt to state and rely upon a narrow or technical test of lack of ability.
    Section 5-409 is important, for it makes it clear that a court entertaining a protective proceeding has full power, through its orders, to do anything the protected person himself might have done if not disabled. Another provision broadens the form of relief so that the court may handle a single transaction, like renewal of a mortgage, or a sale and related investment of proceeds, which is recommended in respect to the affairs of a protected person directly by its orders rather than through the appointment of a conservator.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p01s15-5-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTaVol1e">
       If a conservator is appointed, provisions in Part 4 of the draft give him broad powers of management that may be exercised without a court order. On the other hand, provision is made for restricting the managerial or distribution powers of a conservator, provided notation of the restriction appears on his letters of appointment. Unless restricted, the fiduciary may be able to distribute and end the arrangement without court order if he can meet the terms of the Act. Among other kinds of expenditures and disbursements authorized, payments for the support and education of the protected person as determined by a guardian of the protected person, if any, or by the conservator, if there is no guardian, are approved. Also, certain payments for the support of dependents of the protected person are approved by the Code and hence would require no special approval.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p01s15-5-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTaVol1f">
       Other provisions in Part 4 round out the relationship of protective proceedings to creditors of the protected person and persons who deal with a conservator. Claims are handled by the conservator who is given a fiduciary responsibility to claimants and suitable discretion concerning allowance. If questions arise, the appointing court has all needed power to deal with disputes with creditors. The draft changes the common law rule that contracts of a guardian are his personal responsibility. A conservator is not liable personally on contracts made for the estate unless he agrees to such liability. A section buttresses the managerial powers given to conservator by protecting all persons who deal with them.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p01s15-5-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTaVol1g">
       Another section seeks to reduce the importance of state lines in respect to the authority of conservators by permitting appointees of foreign courts to act locally. Also, it follows the pattern of Article III [Chapter 3] dealing with ancillary administration of decedents’ estates by giving the conservator appointed at the domicile of the protected person priority for appointment locally in case local administration of a protected person’s assets becomes necessary.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p01s15-5-101-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTaVol1h">
       The many states which have adopted the Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act now have two systems for protection of the property of minors and mental incompetents, one of which applies if the property was derived, in whole or in part, from benefits paid by the Veterans Administration and its minor or incompetent owner is or has been a beneficiary of the Veterans Administration, and the other of which applies to all other property. It is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether a person has ever received a benefit from the Veterans Administration and commonly impossible to determine whether property was derived in part from benefits paid by the Veterans Administration. Part 4 would provide a single system for the protection of property of minors and others unable to manage their own property, thus superseding the Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act. It would preserve the right of the Veterans Administration to appear in protective proceedings involving the property of its beneficiaries and would permit the imposition of the same safeguards provided by the superseded Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act.

      Part 2 also permits a testamentary guardian of a minor to receive and expend sums payable to the minor for the minor’s support and education without court order. He may not pay himself for services, however, and is under a duty to deposit excess funds, or to seek a suitable property-protection order if other management is needed.

      Any person under a duty to pay or deliver money or personal property to a minor may perform this duty, in amounts not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per annum, by paying or delivering the money or property to, (1) the minor, if he has attained the age of eighteen (18) years or is married; (2) any person having the care and custody of the minor with whom the minor resides; (3) a guardian of the minor; or (4) a financial institution incident to a deposit in a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor and giving notice of the deposit to the minor. This section does not apply if the person making payment or delivery has actual knowledge that a conservator has been appointed or proceedings for appointment of a conservator of the estate of the minor are pending. The persons, other than the minor or any financial institution under (4) of this section, receiving money or property for a minor, are obligated to apply the money to the support and education of the minor, but may not pay themselves except by way of reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for goods and services necessary for the minor’s support. Any excess sums shall be preserved for future support of the minor and any balance not so used and any property received for the minor must be turned over to the minor when he attains majority. Persons who pay or deliver in accordance with provisions of this section are not responsible for the proper application thereof.

       Where a minor has only a small amount of property, it would be wasteful to require protective proceedings to deal with the property. This section makes it possible for other persons, such as the guardian, to handle the less complicated property affairs of the ward. Protective proceedings, including the possible establishment of conservatorship, will be sought where substantial property is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not go as far as many facility of payment provisions found in trust instruments which usually permit application of sums due minor beneficiary to any expense or charge for the minor. It was felt that a grant of so large an area of discretion to any category of person who might owe funds to a minor would be unwise. Nonetheless, the section as drafted should reduce the need for trust facility of payment provision somewhat, while extending opportunities to insurance companies and other debtors to minors for relatively simple methods of gaining discharge.

     <p>
      A parent or a guardian of a minor or incapacitated person, by a properly executed power of attorney, may delegate to another person, for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or in the case of military personnel serving beyond the territorial limits of the United States for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months, any of the parent’s or guardian’s powers regarding care, custody, or property of the minor or ward including, but not limited to, powers for medical care and educational care of the minor or ward, except the parent’s or guardian’s power to consent to marriage or adoption of a minor or ward. The delegation for a minor to a grandparent of the minor, or to a sibling of the minor, or to a sibling of either parent of the minor, shall continue in effect until the time period, or date, or condition set forth in the power of attorney for automatic expiration of the power of attorney occurs. If the power of attorney does not provide a time period, or date, or condition for automatic expiration of the power, the power of attorney shall continue in effect for a period of three (3) years. The power may be revoked prior to the expiration of the three (3) year period, or prior to the time period, or date, or condition for automatic expiration, in a writing delivered to the grandparent or sibling by the delegating parent or guardian. The power of attorney does not need to be notarized or recorded to be valid. However, if the power is recorded, any revocation of the power by a writing must also be recorded before the revocation is effective.

       This section permits a temporary delegation of parental powers. For example, parents (or guardian) of a minor plan to be out of the country for several months. They wish to empower a close relative (an uncle, e.g.) to take any necessary action regarding the child while they are away. Using this section, they could execute an appropriate power of attorney giving the uncle custody and power to consent. Then, if an emergency operation were required, the uncle could consent on behalf of the child; as a practical matter he would of course attempt to communicate with the parents before acting. The section is designed to reduce problems relating to consents for emergency treatment.

        A father who, after a divorce in which custody of his children was given to his wife and after the wife’s remarriage and removal to the state of Connecticut, failed to make substantial payments for their support, to visit them, or to make sufficient inquiry to learn of their whereabouts was deemed to have abandoned such children and was not entitled to their custody after the death of their mother.

       <p>
        Nonsupport does not necessarily, of itself, constitute abandonment and, where a father’s failure to contribute to the support of his child after a divorce was with the consent of the mother and where the father maintained a continuous and abiding interest in the child, manifested by visitation and by seeking his custody immediately upon the death of the mother, the court did not err in failing to find that he had abandoned the child.

        In a proceeding to determine custody of a child between parent and third party, the court should consider the following factors: (1) interest of the parents, (2) interest of third party caring for the child, and (3) interest of the child. In re Altmiller, 76 Idaho 521, 285 P.2d 1064 (1955).

        In a proceeding of habeas corpus filed by father to obtain custody of child who was in the home of the grandmother, a determination in favor of the father based on ground that he was a fit person to take care of his child even though he had not supported child for five years due to sickness and insufficient funds, was set aside by the Supreme Court on the ground that father was not in a position to adequately care for the child whereas the grandmother had given the child a comfortable home to which the child was much attached.

      § 15-5-202. Testamentary appointment of guardian of minor.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A parent of a minor may appoint a guardian of an unmarried minor by will, subject to the right of the minor under section 15-5-203, Idaho Code. The termination of parental rights of a parent as to the minor shall also terminate the right of that parent to appoint a guardian for the minor. A testamentary appointment becomes effective upon the filing of the guardian’s acceptance in the court in which the will is probated, if, at the decedent’s death, no parent of the minor was alive who had a right to appoint a guardian for the minor. This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by the guardian’s acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator’s domicile. Written notice of acceptance of the appointment must be given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having his custody, or if none, his care, or if none, to his nearest adult relation immediately upon acceptance of appointment. The parent may appoint by will one (1) or more alternate guardians, in order of priority. If a guardian appointed by will fails to accept guardianship within thirty (30) days after the will is probated, or files a notice of declination to accept appointment prior to the running of the thirty (30) day period, or is deceased, or ceases to act after acceptance, then the alternate guardian next in priority becomes the appointed guardian and may file a written notice of acceptance in the court in which the will is probated.

       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 183, rewrote this section, which formerly read: “The parent of a minor may appoint by will a guardian of an unmarried minor. Subject to the right of the minor under section 15-5-203, Idaho Code, a testamentary appointment becomes effective upon filing the guardian’s acceptance in the court in which the will is probated, if before acceptance, both parents are dead. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority. This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the guardian’s acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator’s domicile. Written notice of acceptance of the appointment must be given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having his care or to his nearest adult relation immediately upon acceptance of appointment.”
    The 2014 amendment, by ch. 287, substituted “his custody, or if none, his care, or if none, to his nearest adult relation” for “his care or to his nearest relation” in the fifth sentence and added the last two sentences.

         The court may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor if all parental rights of custody have been terminated by prior court order or upon a finding that the child has been neglected, abused, or abandoned or whose parents are unable to provide a stable home environment. “Abandoned” means the failure of the parent to maintain a normal parental relationship with the child including, but not limited to, reasonable support or regular contact. Failure to maintain a normal parental relationship with the child without just cause for a period of six (6) months shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment. Except in those circumstances described in subsections (2) and (3) of this section and where a temporary guardianship has been created at the request of a parent on active duty in or deployment with the United States armed forces, the court shall consider the best interests of the child as the primary factor in the determination whether to appoint, and whom to appoint, as a guardian for such child. In determining the choice of a guardian for an unmarried minor, the advanced age or disability of a potential guardian shall not, in and of itself, be used as a criterion of the suitability of the potential guardian as long as the potential guardian is otherwise suitable. A guardian appointed by will as provided in section 15-5-202, Idaho Code, whose appointment has not been prevented or nullified under section 15-5-203, Idaho Code, has priority over any guardian who may be appointed by the court, but the court may proceed with an appointment nonetheless upon a finding that the testamentary guardian has failed to accept the testamentary appointment within thirty (30) days after notice of the guardianship proceeding.

        The courts of this state have jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for minors domiciled in the state, and, after having made such appointment, the courts retain jurisdiction for all purposes in connection therewith until the guardian’s accounts are rendered and he is legally discharged.

       <p>
        While parent being competent and not unsuitable is absolutely entitled to the guardianship of minor child, yet the right of parent may be abandoned or forfeited by act or conduct on his part and, if his right is not clear, the best interest of the child will govern decision of the court. Andrino v. Yates, 12 Idaho 618, 87 P. 787 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is only where the legal right of the parent to custody of his child is not clear that child can be committed to the custody of another on ground of welfare. If parent is competent to transact his or her own business and is not otherwise unsuitable, custody of the child is not to be given to another, even though such other may be a more suitable person. In re Crocheron’s Estate, 16 Idaho 441, 101 P. 741 (1909); Jain v. Priest, 30 Idaho 273, 164 P. 364 (1917); McChesney v. Geiger, 35 Idaho 69, 204 P. 658 (1922); Schiller v. Douglas, 48 Idaho 803, 285 P. 1021 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding that a father is a man of intemperate habits and lacking in integrity is not sufficient to deprive him of guardianship of his minor children. In re Crocheron’s Estate, 16 Idaho 441, 101 P. 741 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parents, when suitable, are absolutely entitled to guardianship of their minor children and surrender of such right may be made only in the manner provided by law. Ex parte Martin, 29 Idaho 716, 161 P. 573 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        As between parent and grandparent mere finding that appointment of latter is for best interest of child is insufficient. There must be finding that parent is unfit to have control. Piatt v. Piatt, 32 Idaho 407, 184 P. 470 (1919); Schiller v. Douglas, 48 Idaho 803, 285 P. 1021 (1930).

       <p>
        Fact of parentage having been established, it devolves upon contestants to show forfeiture of right of guardianship or at least that parent is unsuitable person. Schiller v. Douglas, 48 Idaho 803, 285 P. 1021 (1930).

       <p>
        The magistrate has authority under this section to consider, as an alternative to formal termination of parental rights, whether suspension of parental rights may exist because of special circumstances. Diamond v. Diamond, 109 Idaho 409, 707 P.2d 520 (Ct. App. 1985).
    “Suspended by circumstances” must contemplate some set of circumstances which deprives a parent of the ability to accept the rights and responsibilities of parenthood. Irwin v. Celeya, 124 Idaho 888, 865 P.2d 979 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        While there may have been evidence to support the magistrate’s finding that the natural mother’s parental rights were temporarily suspended by circumstances, those circumstances no longer existed at a permanent guardianship hearing where the natural mother made it clear that she no longer desired to leave her children with the non-relative guardians and that she was willing and capable of caring for them; therefore, the magistrate erred in concluding that natural mother’s parental rights were still suspended by circumstances and in proceeding with the permanent guardianship. Irwin v. Celeya, 124 Idaho 888, 865 P.2d 979 (1993).

       The words “all parental rights of custody” are to be read with Sections 5-201 and 5-209 which give testamentary and court-appointed guardians of minors certain parental rights respecting the minor. Hence, no authority to appoint a guardian for a minor exists if a testamentary guardian has accepted an effective appointment by will. The purpose of this restriction is to support and encourage testamentary appointments which may occur without judicial act. If a testamentary guardian proves to be unsatisfactory, removal proceedings as provided in Section 5-211 may be used if the objection device of Section 5-203 is unavailable.

        Rather than provide for priorities among various classes of relatives, it was felt that the only priority should be for the person nominated by the minor. The important point is to locate someone whose appointment will be in the best interests of the minor. If there is contention among relatives over who should be named, it is not likely that a statutory priority keyed to degrees of kinship would help resolve the matter. For example, if the argument involved a squabble between relatives of the child’s father and relatives of its mother, priority in terms of degrees of kinship would be useless.
       </p>
       <p>
        Guardianships under this Code are not likely to be attractive positions for persons who are more interested in handling a minor’s estate than in his personal well being. An order of a court having equity power is necessary if the guardian is to receive payment for services where there is no conservator for the minor’s estate. Also, the powers of management of a ward’s estate conferred on a guardian are restricted so that if a substantial estate is involved, a conservator will be needed to handle the financial matters.

The court may decline to appoint an attorney or guardian ad litem if it finds in writing that such appointment is not necessary to serve the best interests of the minor or if the Idaho department of health and welfare has legal custody of the child.

      This determination by the court must be stated in the order of appointment and in the letters of guardianship.

      <p>
       The “long-arm” principle behind this section is well established. It seems desirable that the Court in which acceptance is filed be able to serve its process on the guardian wherever he has moved. The continuing interest of that court in the welfare of the minor is ample to justify this provision. The consent to service is real rather than fictional in the guardianship situation, where the guardian acts voluntarily in filing acceptance. It is probable that the form of acceptance will expressly embody the provisions of this section, although the statute does not expressly require this.

      § 15-5-209. Powers and duties of guardian of minor.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who has not been deprived of custody of his minor and unemancipated child, except that a guardian is not legally obligated to provide from his own funds for the ward and is not liable to third persons by reason of the parental relationship for acts of the ward. In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian has the following powers and duties:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t15c05p02s15-5-209ol11">
       He must take reasonable care of his ward’s personal effects and commence protective proceedings if necessary to protect other property of the ward.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p02s15-5-209ol12">
       He may receive money payable for the support of the ward to the ward’s parent, guardian or custodian under the terms of any statutory benefit or insurance system, or any private contract, devise, trust, conservatorship or custodianship. He also may receive money or property of the ward paid or delivered by virtue of section 15-5-103, Idaho Code. Any sums so received shall be applied to the ward’s current needs for support, care and education. He must exercise due care to conserve any excess for the ward’s future needs unless a conservator has been appointed for the estate of the ward, in which case the excess shall be paid over at least annually to the conservator. Sums so received by the guardian are not to be used for compensation for his services except as approved by order of the court or as determined by a duly appointed conservator other than the guardian. A guardian may institute proceedings to compel the performance by any person of a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare of the ward.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p02s15-5-209ol13">
       The guardian is empowered to facilitate the ward’s education, social, or other activities and to authorize medical or other professional care, treatment, or advice. A guardian is not liable by reason of this consent for injury to the ward resulting from the negligence or acts of third persons unless it would have been illegal for a parent to have consented. A guardian may consent to the marriage or adoption of his ward.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p02s15-5-209ol14">
       A guardian shall report to the court at least annually on the status of the ward and the ward’s estate which has been subject to his possession or control. All reports shall be under oath or affirmation and shall comply with the Idaho supreme court rules.

      § 15-5-210. Termination of appointment of guardian — General.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A guardian’s authority and responsibility terminates upon the death, resignation or removal of the guardian, termination of the guardianship or upon the minor’s death, adoption, marriage or attainment of majority, but termination does not affect his liability for prior acts, nor his obligation to account for funds and assets of his ward. Resignation of a guardian without the appointment of a successor guardian does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the court. A testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.

       Under Section 1-302 [not adopted in Idaho], the Court is designated as the proper court to handle matters relating to guardianship. The present section is intended to give jurisdiction to the forum where the ward resides as well as to the one where appointment initiated. This has primary importance where the ward’s residence has been moved from the appointing state. Because the Court where acceptance of appointment is filed may as a practical matter be the only forum where jurisdiction over the person of the guardian may be obtained (by reason of Section 5-208), that Court is given concurrent jurisdiction.

       This section, modeled after Section 5-202, is designed to give the surviving parent, or the spouse, of an incapacitated person, the ability to confer the authority of a guardian on a person designated by will. This opportunity may be most useful in cases where parents, during their lifetime, have arranged an informal or voluntary commitment of an incompetent child, and are anxious to designate another who can maintain contact with the patient and act on his behalf without the necessity of a sanity hearing. The person designated by will must act by filing acceptance of the appointment. This provides a check against will directions which might prove to be unwise or unnecessary after the parents’ death. Moreover, the testamentary designee will have the risk of the possibility that the ward is not in fact incapacitated to prevent him from using the authority conferred to restrain the liberty of the ward. In cases of doubt, the testamentary appointee should petition for a Court appointment under Section 5-303.

       Venue in guardianship proceedings lies in the county where the incapacitated person is present, as well as where he resides. Thus, if the person is temporarily away from his county of usual abode, the Court of the county where he happens to be may handle requests for guardianship proceedings relating to him. In protective proceedings, venue is normally in the county of residence. See Section 5-403. See Section 1-303 for disposition when venue is in two counties and for transfer of venue.

     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t15c05p03s15-5-303ol1a">
       The incapacitated person or any person interested in his welfare may petition for a finding of incapacity and appointment of a guardian or co-guardians, limited or general. It is desirable to make available the least restrictive form of guardianship to assist persons who are only partially incapable of caring for their own needs. Recognizing that every individual has unique needs and differing abilities, the public welfare should be promoted by establishing a guardianship that permits incapacitated persons to participate as fully as possible in all decisions affecting them; that assists such persons in meeting the essential requirements for their physical health and safety, in protecting their rights, in managing their financial resources, and in developing or regaining their abilities to the maximum extent possible; and that accomplishes these objectives through providing, in each case, the form of guardianship that least interferes with legal capacity of a person to act in his own behalf. The petition shall include a plan in reasonable detail for the proposed actions of the guardian regarding the affairs of the ward after appointment of the guardian, to the extent reasonably known to the petitioner at the time of filing of the petition. If the complete mental, physical and emotional status, and the health care needs and other needs of the ward are not reasonably known to the petitioner at the time the petition is filed, or if the petitioner is not the proposed guardian, then the guardian shall submit to the court, and to all interested persons, in writing, within thirty (30) days after appointment of the guardian, a reasonably detailed plan covering such matters. Such plan must also be given to any person who has filed a request for notice under section 15-5-406, Idaho Code, and to other persons as the court may direct. Such plan shall be given to all such persons in accordance with the methods set forth in section 15-1-401, Idaho Code. If the plan changes during any time period between the periodic reports of the guardian, the modified plan shall be filed with the next report as a part thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p03s15-5-303ol1b">
       Upon the filing of a petition, the court shall set a date for hearing on the issues of incapacity and unless the allegedly incapacitated person has counsel of his own choice, it shall appoint an attorney to represent him in the proceeding, who shall have the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem. The person alleged to be incapacitated shall be examined by a physician or other qualified person appointed by the court who shall submit his report in writing to the court. The court may, in appropriate cases, appoint a mental health professional, defined as a psychiatrist, psychologist, gerontologist, licensed social worker, or licensed counselor, to examine the proposed ward and submit a written report to the court. The person alleged to be incapacitated also shall be interviewed by a visitor sent by the court. The visitor shall also interview the person who appears to have caused the petition to be filed and any person who is nominated to serve as guardian, and visit the present place of abode of the person alleged to be incapacitated and the place it is proposed that he will be detained or reside if the requested appointment is made and submit his report in writing to the court. Where possible without undue delay and expenses beyond the ability to pay of the allegedly incapacitated person, the court, in formulating the judgment, may utilize the service of any public or charitable agency that offers or is willing to evaluate the condition of the allegedly incapacitated person and make recommendations to the court regarding the most appropriate form of state intervention in his affairs.
    (c) Unless excused by the court for good cause, the proposed guardian shall attend the hearing. The person alleged to be incapacitated is entitled to be present at the hearing in person, and to see or hear all evidence bearing upon his condition. He is entitled to be represented by counsel, to present evidence and subpoena witnesses and documents, to examine witnesses, including the court-appointed physician, mental health professional, or other person qualified to evaluate the alleged impairment, as well as the court-appointed visitor, and otherwise participate in the hearing. The hearing may be a closed hearing upon the request of the person alleged to be incapacitated or his counsel and a showing of good cause. After appointment, the guardian shall immediately provide written notice of any proposed change in the permanent address of the ward to the court and all interested parties.

       The purpose of guardianship is to provide for the care of a person who is unable to care for himself. There is no reason to seek a guardian in those situations where the problems to be dealt with center around the property of a disabled person. In that event, a protective proceeding under Part 4 may be in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is assumed that the standards suggested by the definition in Section 5-101 for the “incapacitated” person are different from those which will determine when a person may be committed as mentally ill. For example, involuntary commitment proceedings may well be inappropriate unless it is determined that the patient is or probably will become dangerous to himself or the person or property of others. As indicated in 5-101, the meaning of “incapacitated” turns on whether the subject lacks “understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions concerning his person.” There is overlap between the two sets of standards, but they are different. Hence, a finding that a person is “incapacitated” does not amount to a finding that he is mentally ill, or can be committed. In the reverse situation, if a person has been committed to institutional care and custody because of mental illness, it may be unnecessary to appoint a guardian for him. Nonetheless, it may be desirable to have a personal guardian for one who is or may be committed or who will be cared for by an institution. For one thing, a guardian, having custody, might arrange for a voluntary care arrangement like that which a parent for a minor and incapacitated child could establish. Moreover, the limited authority of a guardian over property of his ward may be appropriate in cases where the ward is committed. Because the relationship between existing guardianship legislation and the handling of committed persons appears to vary considerably from state to state, the Code was deliberately left rather general on points relevant to the relationship. Section 5-312 qualifies the power of a guardian to determine the place of residence of a ward who has been committed.

       The proceedings under Article V [Chapter 5] are flexible. The Court should not appoint a guardian unless one is necessary or desirable for the care of the person. If it develops that the needs of the person who is alleged to be incapacitated are not those which would call for a guardian, the Court may adjust the proceeding accordingly. By acceptance of the appointment, the guardian submits to the Court’s jurisdiction in much the same way as a personal representative. Cf. Sec. 3-602.

        The persons entitled to notice in guardianship proceeding are usually fewer in number than those in a protective proceeding. Cf. Section 5-405. Required notice shall be given in accordance with the general notice provision of the Code. See Section 1-401.

His appointment would be obtained in emergency situations or as a protective device against default by a guardian.

        A guardian of an incapacitated person must make provision for the ward’s care, comfort, and maintenance. If no conservator has been appointed, the guardian may receive money and property deliverable to the ward and apply them to the ward’s care, but the guardian must exercise care to conserve any excess for the ward’s needs.

        The guardian is responsible for the care of the person of his ward. This section gives him the powers necessary to carry out this responsibility. Where there are no protective proceedings, the guardian also has limited authority over the property of the ward. Where the ward has substantial property, it may be desirable to have protective proceedings to handle his property problems. The same person, of course, may serve as guardian and conservator. Section 5-408 authorizes the Court to make preliminary orders protecting the estate once a petition for appointment of a conservator is filed.

       <p>
        This is the basic section of this part providing for protective proceedings for minors and disabled persons. “Protective proceedings” is a generic term used to describe proceedings to establish conservatorships and obtain protective orders. “Disabled persons” is used in this section to include a broad category of persons who, for a variety of different reasons, may be unable to manage their own property.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the problems of property management are generally the same for minors and disabled persons, it was thought undesirable to treat these problems in two separate parts. Where there are differences, these have been separately treated in specific sections.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Comment to Section 5-304, supra, points up the different meanings of incapacity (warranting guardianship), and disability.

       While the bulk of all judicial proceedings involving the conservator will be in the court supervising the conservatorship, third parties may bring suit against the conservator or the protected person on some matters in other courts. Claims against the conservator after his appointment are dealt with by Section 5-428.

       Venue for protective proceedings lies in the county of residence (rather than domicile) or, in the case of the nonresident, where his property is located. Unitary management of the property is obtainable through easy transfer of proceedings (Section 1-303(b)) and easy collection of assets by foreign conservators (Section 5-431).

       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 71, changed the designations in the section to match the scheme used generally in the Idaho Code; and in the first sentence in subsection (1), deleted “and any government agency paying benefits to the person sought to be protected (if the person seeking the appointment has knowledge of the existence of these benefits)” following “guardian or conservator.” However, the changes by S.L. 2007, ch. 71, § 3 could not be given effect because of the revision of the section by S.L. 2007, ch. 70, § 5.

       It is important that the provision be made for the approval of single transactions or the establishment of protective arrangements as alternatives to full conservatorship. Under present law, a guardianship often must be established simply to make possible a valid transfer of land or securities. This section eliminates the necessity of the establishment of long-term arrangements in this situation.

      The court may require a conservator to furnish a bond conditioned upon faithful discharge of all duties of the trust according to law, with sureties as it shall specify. Unless otherwise directed, the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in his control plus one (1) year’s estimated income minus the value of securities deposited under arrangements requiring an order by the court for their removal and the value of any land which the fiduciary, by express limitation of power, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. The court in lieu of sureties on a bond, may accept other security for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of land.

        A coconservator was not absolutely liable for another conservator’s conversion of insurance proceeds; rather, he was liable for that loss only if he breached his fiduciary duties and that breach had some causal connection with the loss.

        Under the Uniform Probate Code, the duties and liabilities of a conservator are much the same as those of a trustee. Brixey v. Hoffman, 101 Idaho 215, 611 P.2d 1000 (1979).

       The appointment of a conservator vests in him title as trustee to all property of the protected person, presently held or thereafter acquired, including title to any property theretofore held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys in fact, or to the part thereof specified in the order. An order specifying that only a part of the property of the protected person vests in the conservator creates a limited conservatorship.

       The appointment of a conservator is not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or state statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will or trust instrument, imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of his rights or interest, but this section does not restrict the ability of persons to make specific provision by contract or dispositive instrument relating to a conservator.

       This section permits independent administration of the property of protected persons once the appointment of a conservator had been obtained. Any interested person may require the conservator to account in accordance with Section 5-419. As a trustee, a conservator holds title to the property of the protected person. The appointment of a conservator is a serious matter and the Court must select him with great care. Once appointed, he is free to carry on his fiduciary responsibilities. If he should default in these in any way, he may be made to account to the Court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike a situation involving appointment of a guardian, the appointment of a conservator has no bearing on the capacity of the disabled person to contract or engage in other transactions.

      Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets, or the part thereof specified in the letters, of a protected person to the conservator. An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of all assets of the estate subjected to the conservatorship from the conservator to the protected person, or his successors. Letters of conservatorship and orders terminating conservatorship may be recorded in the office of the county recorder in any county in which property affected by such letters or orders is located and, from the time of filing the same for record, notice is imparted to all persons of the contents of such letters or orders.

        A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with him for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order as provided in section 15-5-408[, Idaho Code,] of this Part, is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 15-5-426[, Idaho Code,] of this Part are effective as to third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters. The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

     </h3>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1a">
       A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care or benefit of the protected person and his dependents in accordance with the following principles:
       <ol>
        <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1a1">
         The conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard of support, education and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any. He may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually furnishing support, education or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person, unless he knows that the parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of the protected person.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1a2">
         The conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care or benefit of the protected person with due regard to (A) the size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage his affairs and the estate which has been conserved for him; (B) the accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of his household; (C) other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1a3">
         The conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person’s household who are unable to support themselves, and who are in need of support.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1a4">
         Funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the protected person to reimburse for expenditures which the conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1a5">
         A conservator, in discharging the responsibilities conferred by court order and this part, shall implement the principles described in section 15-5-408(a)[, Idaho Code,] of this code.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1b">
       If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions authorized by the preceding subsections [subsection], a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year twenty percent (20%) of the income from the estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1c">
       When a minor who has not been adjudged disabled under subsection (b) of section 15-5-401[, Idaho Code,] of this part attains his majority, his conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1d">
       When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person’s disability (other than minority) has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-425ol1e">
       If a protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person which may have come into his possession, inform the executor or a beneficiary named therein that he has done so, and retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the decedent or other persons entitled thereto. If after forty (40) days from the death of the protected person no other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative so that he may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent’s estate without additional or further appointment. Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under section 15-3-204[, Idaho Code,] of this code and to any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and indorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this section shall have the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in section 15-3-308[, Idaho Code,] and parts 6 through 10 of chapter 3[, title 15, Idaho Code,] except that the estate in the name of the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent’s successors without prior re-transfer to the conservator as personal representative.
    (f) During the period between the death of a protected person and the appointment of a personal representative for the protected person’s estate, or the conferral of the powers of a personal representative upon the conservator as provided in this section, the person acting as conservator at the time of the deceased protected person’s death shall have the duties and powers of a temporary conservator as set forth in section 15-5-407A, Idaho Code, and the powers set forth in section 54-1142(1)(j), Idaho Code.

       This section sets out those situations wherein the conservator may distribute property or disburse funds during the continuance of or on termination of the trust.

      Subject to the restrictions in subsection (d) [paragraph (b)(4)] of section 15-5-408[, Idaho Code,] of this Part, the court may confer on a conservator at the time of appointment or later, in addition to the powers conferred on him by sections 15-5-424 and 15-5-425[, Idaho Code,] of this Part, any power which the court itself could exercise under subsection (b) and (c) [paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)] of section 15-5-408[, Idaho Code,] of this Part. The court may, at the time of appointment or later, limit the powers of a conservator otherwise conferred by sections 15-5-424 and 15-5-425[, Idaho Code,] of this Part, or previously conferred by the court, and may at any time relieve him of any limitation.

       This section makes it possible to appoint a fiduciary whose powers are limited to part of the estate or who may conduct important transactions, such as sales and mortgages of land, only with special Court authorization. In the latter case, a conservator would be in much the position of a guardian of property under the law currently in force in most states, except that he would have title to the property. The purpose of giving conservators title as trustees is to ensure that the provisions for protection of third parties have full effect. The Veterans Administration may insist that, when it is paying benefits to a minor or disabled, the letters of conservatorship limit powers to those of a guardian under the Uniform Veteran’s Guardianship Act and require the conservator to file annual accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Court may not only limit the powers of the conservator but may expand his powers so as to make it possible for him to act as the Court itself might act.

        A certificate of deposit containing a payable-on-death designation meets the statutory definition of “estate plan,” because it is a contractual arrangement that transfers a benefit at the grantor’s death. Old Nat’l Bank v. Tate, 122 Idaho 401, 834 P.2d 1317 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because bank had no knowledge that grantor said anything to grantee regarding distribution of the proceeds of the certificate of deposit, any estate plan to that extent would not have been binding on bank because it was not known to the bank at time the CD matured; however, bank as conservator of grantor’s estate must account for its handling of CD, payable-on-death account, a known estate plan complete and valid on its face. Oral agreement between grantor and grantee of which bank had no knowledge does not change this. Old Nat’l Bank v. Tate, 122 Idaho 401, 834 P.2d 1317 (1992).

        This section requires conservators to preserve only “known” estate plans. Obviously, conservators cannot be required to preserve estate plans of which they have no knowledge. Old Nat’l Bank v. Tate, 122 Idaho 401, 834 P.2d 1317 (1992). Procedure When Validity of Estate Questioned.

       <p>
        When conservators in the administration of estates have knowledge of an estate plan valid and complete on its face, they must under this section, take into account and preserve that estate plan insofar as possible. Once this is done, if a question arises as to validity of the estate plan either because of a perceived technical defect in its creation or because of allegations of incompetency on the part of the grantor, or undue influence or duress by others.

       A conservator must pay from the estate all just claims against the estate and against the protected person arising before or after the conservatorship upon their presentation and allowance. A claim may be presented by either of the following methods: (1) the claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant and the amount claimed; (2) the claimant may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court and deliver or mail a copy of the statement to the conservator. A claim is deemed presented on the first to occur of receipt by the conservator of a written statement of claim or the filing with the court of the written statement of claim. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the conservator to the claimant within sixty (60) days after its presentation. The presentation of a claim tolls any statute of limitations relating to the claim until thirty (30) days after its disallowance.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-428ol1b">
       A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of his claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitation, and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance and payment from the estate. If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a claim against the estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05p04s15-5-428ol1c">
       If it appears that the estate in conservatorship is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference is to be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance and education of the protected person or his dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.

      The protected person, his personal representative, the conservator, or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the conservatorship. A protected person seeking termination is entitled to the same rights and procedure as in an original proceeding for a protective order. The court, upon determining after notice and hearing that the minority or disability of the protected person has ceased or that it would be in the best interests of the protected person to establish the conservatorship in another jurisdiction may terminate the conservatorship and, where appropriate, order initiation of proceedings in another jurisdiction or delivery of the assets to a foreign conservator as set forth in chapters 9, 10 and/or 11, title 15, Idaho Code. Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the former protected person or to his successor subject to provision in the order for expenses of administration or to conveyances from the conservator to the former protected person or his successors, to evidence the transfer.

       This section organizes the sections which follow into those dealing with the relationship between parties to multiple-party accounts on the one hand, and those relating to the financial institution-depositor (or party) relationship, on the other. By keeping these relationships separate, it is possible to achieve the degree of definiteness that financial institutions must have in order to be induced to offer multiple-party accounts for use by their customers, while preserving the opportunity for individuals involved in multiple-party accounts to show various intentions that may have attended the original deposit, or any unusual transactions affecting the account thereafter. The separation thus permits individuals using accounts of the type dealt with by these sections to avoid unconsidered and unwanted definiteness in regard to their relationship with each other. In a sense, the approach is to implement a layman’s wish to “trust” a co-depositor by leaving questions that may arise between them essentially unaffected by the form of the account.

        Establishment of a joint account may effect a gift by the depositor to the other party or parties to the account. In determining the effect of a joint account agreement, the significant consideration is the intent of the depositor, and the party asserting that a gift was intended must prove all the elements of a gift, excepting irrevocable delivery, by clear and convincing evidence.

      <p>
       This section reflects the assumption that a person who deposits funds in a multiple-party account normally does not intend to make an irrevocable gift of all or any part of the funds represented by the deposit. Rather, he usually intends no present change of beneficial ownership. The assumption may be disproved by proof that a gift was intended. Read with Section 6-101(6) which defines “net contributions,” the section permits parties to certain kinds of multiple-party accounts to be as definite, or as indefinite, as they wish in respect to the matter of how beneficial ownership should be apportioned between them. It is important to note that the section is limited to describe ownership of an account while original parties are alive. Section 6-104 prescribes what happens to beneficial ownership on the death of a party. The section does not undertake to describe the situation between parties if one withdraws more than he is then entitled to as against the other party. Sections 6-108 and 6-112 protect a financial institution in such circumstances without reference to whether a withdrawing party may be entitled to less than he withdraws as against another party. Presumably, overwithdrawal leaves the party making the excessive withdrawal liable to the beneficial owner as a debtor or trustee. Of course, evidence of intention by one to make a gift to the other of any sums withdrawn by the other in excess of his ownership should be effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final Code contains no provision dealing with division of the account when the parties fail to prove net contributions. The omission is deliberate. Undoubtedly a court would divide the account equally among the parties to the extent that net contributions cannot be proven; but a statutory section explicitly embodying the rule might undesirably narrow the possibility of proof of partial contributions and might suggest that gift tax consequences applicable to creation of a joint tenancy should attach to a joint account. The theory of these sections is that the basic relationship of the parties is that of individual ownership of values attributable to their respective deposits and withdrawals; the right of survivorship which attaches unless negated by the form of the account really is a right to the values theretofore owned by another which the survivor receives for the first time at the death of the owner. That is to say, the account operates as a valid disposition at death rather than as a present joint tenancy.

      <p>
       The effect of (a) of this section, when read with the definition of “joint account” in 6-101(4), is to make an account payable to one or more of two or more parties a survivorship arrangement unless “clear and convincing evidence of a different contention” is offered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The underlying assumption is that most persons who use joint accounts want the survivor or survivors to have all balances remaining at death. This assumption may be questioned in states like Michigan where existing statutes and decisions do not provide any safe and wholly practical method of establishing a joint account which is not survivorship. See
    Leib v. Genesee Merchants Bank
    , 371 Mich. 89, 123 N.W.(2d) 140 (1962). But, use of a form negating survivorship would make (d) of this section applicable. Still, the financial institution which paid after the death of a party would be protected by 6-108 and 6-109. Thus, a safe nonsurvivorship account form is provided. Consequently, the presumption stated by this section should become increasingly defensible.
    The section also is designed to apply to various forms of multiple-party accounts which may be in use at the effective date of the legislation. The risk that it may turn nonsurvivorship accounts into unwanted survivorship arrangements is meliorated by various considerations. First of all, there is doubt that many persons using any form of multiple name account would not want survivorship rights to attach. Secondly, the survivorship incidents described by this section may be shown to have been against the intention of the parties. Finally, it would be wholly consistent with the purpose of the legislation to provide for a delayed effective date so that financial institutions could get notices to customers warning them of possible review of accounts which may be desirable because of the legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) accepts the New York view that an account opened by “A” in his name as “trustee for B” usually is intended by A to be an informal will of any balance remaining on deposit at his death. The section is framed so that accounts with more than one “trustee,” or more than one “beneficiary” can be accommodated. Section 6-103(c) would apply to such an account during the lifetimes of “all parties.” “Party” is defined by 6-101 (7) so as to exclude a beneficiary who is not described by the account as having a present right of withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a trust account for two or more beneficiaries, the section prescribes a presumption that all beneficiaries who survive the last “trustee” to die own equal and undivided interests in the account. This dovetails with Sections 6-111 and 6-112 which give the financial institution protection only if it pays to all beneficiaries who show a right to withdraw by presenting appropriate proof of death. No further survivorship between surviving beneficiaries of a trust account is presumed because these persons probably have had no control over the form of the account prior to the death of the trustee. The situation concerning further survivorship between two or more surviving parties to a joint account is different.

      The provisions of section 15-6-104[, Idaho Code,] of this Part as to rights of survivorship are determined by the form of the account at the death of a party. This form may be altered by written order given by a party to the financial institution to change the form of the account or to stop or vary payment under the terms of the account. The order or request must be signed by a party, received by the financial institution during the party’s lifetime, and not countermanded by other written order of the same party during his lifetime.

       It is to be noted that only a “party” may issue an order blocking the provisions of Section 6-104. “Party” is defined by Section 6-101(7). Thus if there is a trust account in the name of A or B in trust for C, C cannot change the right of survivorship because he has no present right of withdrawal and hence is not a party.

        Article 6 of the Uniform Probate Code was completely revised by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1989. The State of Idaho did not adopt the 1989 revision of Article 6. However, in 2003, the Idaho legislature adopted the 1998 amendment of section 6-102 of revised Article 6, with minor changes to reflect Idaho probate law, to replace Section 6-107, Rights of Creditors, from the original 1971 adoption of the Uniform Probate Code. The Comment below is taken from the 1998 revision of Section 6-102 of the Revised Article 6.

        Added to the Code in 1998 [2003], this section clarifies that the recipients of nonprobate transfers can be required to contribute to pay allowed claims and statutory allowances to the extent the probate estate is inadequate. The maximum liability for a single nonprobate transferee is the value of the transfer. Values are determined under subsection (b) [(2)] as of the time when the benefits are “received or controlled by the transferee.” This would be the date of the decedent’s death for nonprobate transfers made by means of a revocable trust, and date of receipt for other nonprobate transfers. Two or more transferees are severally liable for the proportion of the liability based on the value of transfers received by each.

        Section 6-102 [15-6-107] replaces Section 6-215 with coverage designed to extend the principle of Section 6-215 to transfers at death by revocable trust, TOD security registration agreements and similar death benefits not insulated from decedents’ creditors or statutory allowances by other legislation. The initial clause of subsection (b) [(2)], “Except as otherwise provided by statute,” is designed to prevent a conflict with and to clarify that this section does not supersede existing legislation protecting death benefits in life insurance, retirement plans or IRAs from claims by creditors.

        The definition of “nonprobate transfer” in subsection (a) [(1)] includes revocable transfers by a decedent; it does not include a transfer at death incident to a decedent’s exercise or non-exercise of a presently exercisable general power of appointment created by another person. The drafters decided against including such powers even though presently exercisable general powers of appointment are subject to the Code’s augmented estate provisions dealing with protection of a surviving spouse from disinheritance. Spousal protection against disinheritance by the other spouse supports the institution of marriage; creditors are better able to fend for themselves than financially disadvantaged surviving spouses. In addition, a presently exercisable general power of appointment created by another person is commonly viewed as a provision in the trust creator’s instrument designed to provide flexibility in the estate plan rather than as a gift to the donee.

        The required ability to revoke or otherwise prevent a nonprobate transfer at death that is vital to application of subsection (a) [(1)] is described as a “power,” a word intended by the drafters to signify legal authority rather than capacity or practical ability. This corresponds to the definition in Code Section 2-201(6).

       <li id="t15c06p01s15-6-107-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol15">
        The exclusion of a “survivorship interest in joint tenancy of real estate” from the definition of “nonprobate transfer” in subsection (a) [(1)] is contrary to the law of some states (e.g., South Dakota) that allow an insolvent decedent’s creditors to reach the share the decedent could have received prior to death by unilateral severance of the joint tenancy. The law in most other states is to the contrary. By excluding real estate joint tenancies, stability of title and ease of title examination is preserved. Moreover, real estate joint tenancies have served for generations to keep the share of a couples’ real estate owned by the first to die out of probate and away from estate creditors. This familiar arrangement need not be disturbed incident to expanding the ability of decedents’ creditors to reach newly recognized nonprobate transfers at death.
    No view is expressed as to whether a survivorship interest in personal or intangible property registered in two or more names as joint tenants with right of survivorship would come within 6-102(a) [15-6-102(1)]. The outcome might depend on who originated the registration and whether severance by any co-owner acting alone was possible immediately preceding a co-owner’s death.

       <li id="t15c06p01s15-6-107-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol16">
        A feature of replaced Section 6-215 that was clarified by 1991 technical amendment protects a survivor beneficiary of a joint account from liability to the probate estate of a deceased co-depositor for funds in the account owned by the survivor prior to decedent’s death. Subsection (a) [(1)] continues this protection by use of the language “valid transfer effective at death . . . by a transferor . . . [who] had power, acting alone, to prevent the transfer by revocation or withdrawal and instead use the property for the benefit of the transferor . . .” Section 6-211 and related sections of the Code make it clear that parties to a joint and survivor account separately own values in the account in proportion to net contributions. Hence, a surviving joint account depositor who had contributed to the balance on deposit prior to the death of the other party is subject to the remedies described in this section only to the extent of new account values gained through survival of the decedent.
       </li>
       <li id="t15c06p01s15-6-107-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol17">
        Transferees of nonprobate transfers subject to the possible liability described in subsection (b) include trustees of revocable trusts to the extent of assets transferred to the trust before death that were subject to the decedent’s sole power to revoke. Such assets would be valued as of the date of death. While the trustee of an irrevocable trust, or of a trust that may be revoked only by the settlor and another person would ordinarily not be subject to this section, this section could apply if the trust is named as a beneficiary of a nonprobate transfer, such as of securities registered in TOD form. Under subsection (b) [(2)], such a transfer would involve a possibility of trust liability based on the value of the TOD transfer as of the time of its receipt. Liability under this section incurred by a trustee is a trust liability for which the trustee does not incur personal liability except as provided by UPC Section 3-808(b) [15-3-808(b)].
       </li>
       <li id="t15c06p01s15-6-107-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol18">
        Trusts and non-trust recipients of nonprobate transfers incur liability in the order described in subsection (c) [(3)]. Note that either a revocable or an irrevocable trust might be designated devisee of a pour-over provision that would make the trust the “principal non-probate instrument in the decedent’s estate plan” and, consequently, make it liable under subsection (c)(2) [(3)(b)] ahead of other nonprobate transferees to the extent of values acquired by a transfer at death as described in subsection (a) [(1)]. Note, too, that nothing would pass to the receptacle trust by the pour-over devise if all probate estate assets are used to discharge statutory allowances and claims. However, the fact that the trust was designated to receive a pour-over devise signals that the trust probably includes the equivalent of a residuary clause measuring benefits by available assets and signaling probable intention of the settlor that residuary benefits should abate to pay the settlor’s debts prior to other trust gifts.
       </li>
       <li id="t15c06p01s15-6-107-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol19">
        The abatement order among classes of beneficiaries of trusts specified by subsection (d) [(4)] applies to all trusts subject to liability to the extent of nonprobate transfers received or administered whether or not the trust instrument is the principal nonprobate instrument in the decedent’s estate plan. The drafters decided against a cross-reference to the Code’s abatement provision, Section 3-902 [15-3-902], in part because that section deals with intestate and partially intestate estates as well as estates governed by wills. Note, too, that trusts for successive beneficiaries also will be governed by income and principal accounting principles that will serve to resolve some abatement issues.
    10. Subsection (e) [5] recognizes that a number of separate instruments and transactions, executed at different times and with or without internal references linking them to other documents, may constitute the paperwork describing succession to a decedent’s assets by probate and nonprobate methods. By authorizing control of abatement among gifts made by various transfers at death by the last executed instrument, the subsection permits a simple, last-minute override of earlier directions concerning a decedent’s wishes regarding priorities among successors. Thus, a will or trust amendment can correct or avoid liquidity and abatement problems discovered prior to death. The expression “block buster will” was coined by estate planners in the mid-70’s to signal interest in legislation enabling a later will to override death benefits by any nonprobate transfer device. This subsection meets some of the goals of advocates of this legislation.

       This section replaces Section 6-107 [15-6-107] of the original Code, and its 1989 sequel, 6-215. To the extent a deceased party’s probate estate was insufficient, these sections made a deceased party’s interest in multiple name accounts in financial institutions passing outside probate liable for the deceased party’s statutory allowances and creditor claims. Assets passing at death by revocable trust or TOD asset registration agreements were not covered by these sections. Also, Section 6-201(b) [15-6-201(b)] of the original Code and its 1989 sequel, 6-101(b), provided merely that the section did not limit any other rights that might exist. Neither section created any rights.
    If there are no probate assets, a creditor or other person seeking to use this Section 6-102 [15-6-107] would first need to secure appointment of a personal representative to invoke Code procedures for establishing a creditor’s claim as “allowed.” The use of probate proceedings as a prerequisite to gaining rights for creditors against nonprobate transferees has been a feature of UPC Article VI [Chapter 6] since originally approved in 1969. It works well in practice. The Article III [Chapter 3] procedures for opening estates, satisfying probate exemptions, and presenting claims are very efficient.

       If a state’s insurance laws do not exempt or protect a particular insurance death benefit, the insured’s creditors would not be able to establish a “nonprobate transfer” under (a) [(1)] except to the extent of any cash surrender value generated by premiums paid by the insured that the insured could have obtained immediately before death. Note, also, that (i)(1) [(9)(a)] would protect a life insurance company that paid a death benefit before receiving written notice from the decedent’s personal representative.
      </p>
      <p>
       11. Subsection (f) [(6)] builds on the principle employed in the Code’s augmented estate provisions (UPC<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.02.html#t02c02s2-201" target="_blank">§§ 2-201 </a></cite>— 2-214) in relation to nonprobate transfers made to persons in other states, possibly by transactions governed by laws of other states. The underlying principle is that the law of a decedent’s last domicile should be controlling as to rules of public policy that override the decedent’s power to devise the estate to anyone the decedent chooses. The principle is implemented by subjecting donee recipients of the decedent to liability under the decedent’s domiciliary law, with the belief that judgments recovered in that state following appropriate due process notice to defendants in other states will be accorded full faith and credit by courts in other states should collection proceedings be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       12. The first and third sentences of subsection (g) [(7)] are identical to sentences now appearing in UPC Section 6-215, which this section replaces. The second sentence is new. It reflects sensitivity for the dilemma confronting a probate fiduciary who, acting as required of a fiduciary, concludes that the costs and risks associated with a possible recovery from a nonprobate transferee outweigh the probable advantages to the estate and its claimants. A creditor whose claim has been allowed but remains unsatisfied and whose demand for a proceeding has been turned down by the estate fiduciary may proceed at personal risk in efforts to enforce the estate claim against the nonprobate beneficiary. This is so because the last two sentences of (g) [(7)] shift the risk of unrecoverable costs from the decedent’s estate to the claimant who undertakes collection efforts on behalf of the decedent’s estate. Any recovery of costs should be used to reimburse the claimant who bore the risk of loss for the proceeding. A personal representative tempted to decline a demand for a proceeding should note that the “good faith” standard of this section must be determined in light of the fiduciary responsibility imposed by UPC Section 3-703 [15-3-703].
      </p>
      <p>
       13. Subparagraph (h) [(8)] meshes with time limits in the Code’s sections governing allowance and disallowance of claims. See Sections 3-804 [15-3-804] and 3-806 [15-3-806].
      </p>
      <p>
       14. Subsection (i)(1) [(9)(a)] is designed to protect issuers of TOD security registrations who make payments or delivery to designated death beneficiaries before receiving notice from the decedent’s probate estate of a probable insolvency. These entities are not “transferees” subject to liability under subsection (b) [(2)], but they might incur legal or other costs if the beneficiaries request payment in spite of warning notices from estate fiduciaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (i)(2) [(9)(b)] is designed to enable trustees handling nonprobate transfers to distribute trust assets in accordance with trust terms if no warning of probable estate insolvency has been received. Beneficiaries receiving distributions from a trustee take subject to personal liability in the amount and priority of the trustee based on the value distributed.

       <p>
        This section authorizes a variety of contractual arrangements which have in the past been treated as testamentary. For example most courts treat as testamentary a provision in a promissory note that if the payee dies before payment is made the note shall be paid to another named person, or a provision in a land contract that if the seller dies before payment is completed the balance shall be cancelled and the property shall belong to the vendee. These provisions often occur in family arrangements. The result of holding the provisions testamentary is usually to invalidate them because not executed in accordance with the statute of wills. On the other hand the same courts have for years upheld beneficiary designations in life insurance contracts. Similar kinds of problems are arising in regard to beneficiary designations in pension funds and under annuity contracts. The analogy of the power of appointment provides some historical base for solving some of these problems aside from a validating statute. However, there appear to be no policy reasons for continuing to treat these varied arrangements as testamentary. The revocable living trust and the multiple-party bank accounts, as well as the experience with United States government bonds payable on death to named beneficiaries, have demonstrated that the evils envisioned if the statute of wills is not rigidly enforced simply do not materialize. The fact that these provisions often are part of a business transaction and in any event are evidenced by a writing eliminate the danger of “fraud.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the types of provisions described in the statute are characterized as nontestamentary, the instrument does not have to be executed in compliance with Section 2-502; nor does it have to be probated, nor does the personal representative have any power or duty with respect to the assets involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sole purpose of this section is to eliminate the testamentary characterization from the arrangements falling within the terms of the section. It does not invalidate other arrangements by negative implication. Thus it is not intended by this section to embrace oral trusts to hold property at death for named persons; such arrangements are already generally enforceable under trust law.

       “Survive” is not defined.

For purposes of this Act, survive is used in its common law sense of outliving another for any time interval no matter how brief. The drafting committee sought to avoid imposition of a new and unfamiliar meaning of the term on intermediaries familiar with the meaning of “survive” in joint tenancy registrations.
    The definitions of “devisee,” “heirs,” “person,” “personal representative,” “property,” and “state” are taken from Section 1-201 of the Uniform Probate Code which, as revised in 1989, includes this Act as Part 3 of Article VI.

       This section is designed to prevent co-owners from designating any death beneficiary other than one who is to take only upon survival of all co-owners. It coerces co-owning registrants to signal whether they hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship (JT TEN), as tenants by the entireties (T ENT), or as owners of community property. Also, it imposes survivorship on co-owners holding in a beneficiary form that fails to specify a survivorship form of holding. Tenancy in common and community property otherwise than in a survivorship setting in negated for registration in beneficiary form because persons desiring to signal independent death beneficiaries for each individual’s fractional interest in a co-owned security normally will split their holding into separate registrations of the number of units previously constituting their fractional share. Once divided, each can name his or her own choice of death beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “individuals,” as used in this section, limits those who may register as owner or co-owner of a security in beneficiary from to natural persons. However, the section does not restrict individuals using this ownership form as to their choice of death beneficiary. The definition of “beneficiary form” in Section 1 indicates that any “person” may be designated beneficiary in a registration in beneficiary form. “Person” is defined so that a church, trust company, family corporation, or other entity, as well as any individual, may be designated as a beneficiary.

       This section encourages registrations in beneficiary form to be made whenever a state with which either of the parties to a registration has contact has enacted this or a similar statute. Thus, a registration in beneficiary form of X Company shares might rely on an enactment of this Act in X Company’s state of incorporation, or in the state of incorporation of X Company’s transfer agent. Or, an enactment by the state of the issuer’s principal office, the transfer agent’s principal office, or of the issuer’s office making the registration also would validate the registration. An enactment of the state of the registering owner’s address at time of registration also might be used for validation purposes.

       The abbreviation POD is included for use without regard for whether the subject is a money claim against an issuer, such as its own note or bond for money loaned, or is a claim to securities evidenced by conventional title documentation. The use of POD in a registration in beneficiary form of shares in an investment company should not be taken as a signal that the investment is to be sold or redeemed on the owner’s death so that the sums realized may be “paid” to the death beneficiary. Rather, only a transfer on death, not a liquidation on death, is indicated. The committee would have used only the abbreviation TOD except for the familiarity, rooted in experience with certificates of deposit and other deposit accounts in banks, with the abbreviation POD as signalling a valid nonprobate death benefit or transfer on death.

       This section simply affirms the right of a sole owner, or the right of all multiple owners, to end a TOD beneficiary registration without the assent of the beneficiary. The section says nothing about how a TOD beneficiary designation may be canceled, meaning that the registering entity’s terms and conditions, if any, may be relevant. See Section 10. If the terms and conditions have nothing on the point, cancellation of a beneficiary designation presumably would be effected by a reregistration showing a different beneficiary or omitting reference to a TOD beneficiary.

      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

       Even though multiple owners holding in the beneficiary form here authorized hold with right of survivorship, no survivorship rights attend the positions of multiple beneficiaries who become entitled to securities by reason of having survived the sole owner or the last to die of multiple owners. Issuers (and registering entities) who decide to accept registrations in beneficiary form involving more than one primary beneficiary also should provide by rule whether fractional shares will be registered in the names of surviving beneficiaries where the number of shares held by the deceased owner does not divide without remnant among the survivors. If fractional shares are not desired, the issuer may wish to provide for sale of odd shares and division of proceeds, for an uneven distribution with the first or last named to receive the odd share, or for other resolution. Section 8 deals with whether intermediaries have any obligation to offer beneficiary registrations of any sort; Section 10 enables issuers to adopt terms and conditions controlling the details of applications for registrations they decide to accept and procedures for implementing such registrations after an owner’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to surviving, multiple TOD beneficiaries as tenants in common is not intended to suggest that a registration form specifying unequal shares, such as “TOD A (20%), B (30%), C (50%)” would be improper. Though not included in the beneficiary forms described for illustrative purposes in Section 10, the Act enables a registering entity to accept and implement a TOD beneficiary designation like the one just suggested. If offered, such a registration form should be implemented by registering entity terms and conditions providing for disposition of the share of a beneficiary who predeceases the owner when two or more of a group of multiple beneficiaries survive the owner. For example, the terms might direct the share of the predeceased beneficiary to the survivors in the proportion that their original shares bore to each other. Unless unequal shares are specified in a registration in beneficiary form designating multiple beneficiaries, the shares of the beneficiaries would, of course, be equal.
    The statement that a security registered in beneficiary form is in the deceased owner’s estate when no beneficiary survives the owner is not intended to prevent application of any anti-lapse statute that might direct a nonprobate transfer on death to the surviving issue of a beneficiary who failed to survive the owner. Rather, the statement is intended only to indicate that the registering entity involved should transfer or reregister the security as directed by the decedent’s personal representative.

       “Good faith” as used in this section is intended to mean “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade,” as specified in UCC<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.02.html#t02c01s2-103" target="_blank">§ 2-103</a></cite>(1)(b).

       The protections described in this section are designed to meet any questions regarding registering entity protection that may not be foreclosed by issuer protections provided in the Uniform Commercial Code. Because persons interested in this Act may wish to be reminded of relevant UCC provisions, a brief summary follows.
      </p>
      <p>
       “U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c04s8-403" target="_blank">§ 8-403</a></cite>, ‘Issuer’s Duty as to Adverse Claims’ contains detailed provisions regarding duties of inquiry by an issuer of a certificated or uncertificated security who is requested to effect a transfer, and the availability and use of 30 day notices to force adverse claimants to start litigation if further delay in transfer is desired. U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c02s8-201" target="_blank">§ 8-201</a></cite>’s definition of ‘issuer’ for purposes of ‘registration of transfer . . .’ is simply ‘a person on whose behalf transfer books are maintained’. U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c04s8-403" target="_blank">§ 8-403</a></cite> is among the sections dealing with registration of transfers.
    “U.C.C. sections 8-308 and 8-404(1) appear to exonerate an issuer who acts in response to transfer directions signalled by the ‘necessary indorsement’ on or with a certificated security or in responsed to ‘an instruction originated by an appropriate person’ in the case of an uncertificated security. Section 8-308 describes the meaning of ‘appropriate person’ in the case of a certificated security as ‘the person specified by the certificated security . . . to be entitled to the security.’ U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c03s8-308" target="_blank">§ 8-308</a></cite>(6) (1978). In the case of an uncertificated security, ‘appropriate person’ means the ‘registered owner.’

   <cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c03s8-308" target="_blank">§ 8-308</a></cite>(7). The survivor of owners listed as joint tenants with right of survivorship is specifically defined as an authorized person.
    <span class="s1">
     Id.
    </span>
   <cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c03s8-308" target="_blank">§ 8-308</a></cite>(8)(d). The U.C.C. aspect of the problem could be met by an additional sub-paragraph to section 8-308(8) that would include a TOD beneficiary as an ‘appropriate person’ when the beneficiary has survived the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       “No U.C.C. addition would be necessary if a TOD beneficiary designation were viewed as a contingent order for transfer at the owner’s death that may be safely implemented as a direction from the owner as an ‘authorized person.’ The owner’s death before completion of the transfer would not pose U.C.C. problems because section 8-308(10) provides: ‘Whether the person signing is appropriate is determined as of the date of signing and an indorsement made by or an instruction originated by him does not become unauthorized for the purposes of this Article by virtue of any subsequent change of circumstances.’
      </p>
      <p>
       “It might be questioned whether a TOD direction, which may be revoked before it is carried into effect and is also contingent on the beneficiary’s survival of the registrant, is within the transfer directions contemplated by the U.C.C. framers for purposes of issuer protection. However, since section 8-202 explicitly protects issuers against problems arising because of restrictions or conditions on transfers, only the novelty of revocable directions for transfer on death gives pause.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In general, article 8 of the U.C.C. reflects a careful attempt to protect implementation of a wide range of transfer instructions so long as the signatures are genuine and are those of owners acting in conformity with duly imposed rules of the issuer organization. . ..
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, existing U.C.C. protections should be adequate, . . .”

       A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests (i) for registrations in beneficiary form, and (ii) for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary’s descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary’s death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes.” This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary’s descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary’s domicile at the owner’s death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one (1) or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity’s terms and conditions.

        Use of “and” or “or” between the names of persons registered as co-owners is unnecessary under the Act and should be discouraged. If used, the two words should have the same meaning insofar as concerns a title form;
        <span class="s1">

        Descendants of a named beneficiary who take by virtue of a “LDPS” designation appended to a beneficiary’s name take as TOD beneficiaries rather than as intestate successors. If no descendant of a predeceased primary beneficiary survives the owner, the security passes as a part of the owner’s estate as provided in Section 7.

     <p>
      The trustee of a trust having its principal place of administration in this state shall register the trust in the court of this state at the principal place of administration. Unless otherwise designated in the trust instrument, the principal place of administration of a trust is the trustee’s usual place of business where the records pertaining to the trust are kept, or at the trustee’s residence if he has no such place of business. In the case of co-trustees, the principal place of administration, if not otherwise designated in the trust instrument, is (1) the usual place of business of the corporate trustee if there is but one (1) corporate co-trustee, or (2) the usual place of business or residence of the individual trustee who is a professional fiduciary if there is but one (1) such person and no corporate co-trustee, and otherwise (3) the usual place of business or residence of any of the co-trustees as agreed upon by them. The duty to register under this Part does not apply to the trustee of a trust if registration would be inconsistent with the retained jurisdiction of a foreign court from which the trustee cannot obtain release.

        Several considerations explain the presence in the Uniform Probate Code of procedures applicable to inter vivos and testamentary trusts. The most important is that the Court assumed by the Code is a full power court which appropriately may receive jurisdiction over trustees. Another is that personal representatives under Articles III and IV [Chapters 3 and 4] and conservators under Article V [Chapter 5], have the status of trustees. It follows naturally that these fiduciaries and regular trustees should bear a similar relationship to the Court. Also, the general move of the Code away from the concept of supervisory jurisdiction over any fiduciary is compatible with the kinds of procedural provisions which are believed to be desirable for trustees.
       </p>
       <p>
        The relevance of trust procedures to those relating to settlement of decedents’ estates is apparent in many situations. Many trusts are created by will. In a substantial number of states, statutes now extend probate court control over decedents’ estates to testamentary trustees, but the same procedures rarely apply to inter vivos trusts. For example, eleven states appear to require testamentary trustees to qualify and account in much the same manner as executors, though quite different requirements relate to trustees of inter vivos trusts in these same states. Twenty-four states impose some form of mandatory court accountings on testamentary trustees, while only three seem to have comparable requirements for inter vivos trustees.
       </p>
       <p>
        From an estate planning viewpoint, probate court supervision of testamentary trustees causes many problems. In some states, testamentary trusts cannot be released to be administered in another state. This requires complicated planning if inconvenience to interested persons is to be avoided when the beneficiaries move elsewhere. Also, some states preclude foreign trust companies from serving as trustees of local testamentary trusts without complying with onerous or prohibitive qualification requirements. Regular accountings in court have proved to be more expensive than useful in relation to the vast majority of trusts and sometimes have led to the ill-advised use of legal life estates to avoid these burdens.
       </p>
       <p>
        The various restrictions applicable to testamentary trusts have caused many planners to recommend use of revocable inter vivos trusts. The widely adopted Uniform Testamentary Addition to Trusts Act has accelerated this tendency by permitting testators to devise estates to trustees of previously established receptacle trusts which have and retain the characteristics of inter vivos trusts for purpose of procedural requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The popularity of this legislation and the widespread use of pour-over wills indicates rather vividly the obsolescence and irrelevance of statutes contemplating supervisory jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the problems with inter vivos and receptacle trusts at the present time, however, is that persons interested in these arrangements as trustees or beneficiaries frequently discover that there are no simple and efficient statutory or judicial remedies available to them to meet the special needs of the trust relationship. Proceedings in equity before courts of general jurisdiction are possible, of course, but the difficulties of obtaining jurisdiction over all interested persons on each occasion when a judicial order may be necessary or desirable are commonly formidable. A few states offer simplified procedures on a voluntary basis for inter vivos as well as testamentary trusts. In some of these, however, the legislation forces inter vivos trusts into unpopular patterns involving supervisory control. Nevertheless, it remains true of the legislation in most states that there is too little for inter vivos trusts and too much for trusts created by will.
    Other developments suggest that enactment of useful, uniform legislation on trust procedures is a matter of considerable social importance. For one thing, accelerating mobility of persons and estates is steadily increasing the pressure on locally oriented property institutions. The drafting and technical problems created by lack of uniformity of trust procedures in the several states are quite serious. If people cannot obtain efficient trust service to preserve and direct wealth because of state property rules, they will turn in time to national arrangements that eliminate property law problems. A general shift away from local management of trusteed wealth and increased reliance on various contractual claims against national funds seems the most likely consequence if the local law of trusts remains nonuniform and provincial.
       </p>
       <p>
        Modestly endowed persons who are turning to inter vivos trusts to avoid probate are of more immediate concern. Lawyers in all parts of the country are aware of the trend toward reliance on revocable trusts as total substitutes for wills which recent controversies about probate procedures have stimulated. There would be little need for concern about this development if it could be assumed also that the people involved are seeking and getting competent advice and fiduciary assistance. But there are indications that many people are neither seeking nor receiving adequate information about trusts they are using. Moreover, professional fiduciaries are often not available as trustees for small estates. Consequently, neither settlors nor trustees of “do-it-yourself” trusts have much idea of what they are getting into. As a result, there are corresponding dangers to beneficiaries who are frequently uninformed or baffled by formidable difficulties in obtaining relief or information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Enactment of clear statutory procedures creating simple remedies for persons involved in trust problems will not prevent disappointment for many of these persons but should help minimize their losses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several objectives of the Code are suggested by the preceding discussion. They may be summarized as follows:

        Registration of trusts is a new concept and differs importantly from common arrangements for retained supervisory jurisdiction of courts of probate over testamentary trusts. It applies alike to inter vivos and testamentary trusts, and is available to foreign-created trusts as well as those locally created. The place of registration is related not to the place where the trust was created, which may lose its significance to the parties concerned, but is related to the place where the trust is primarily administered, which in turn is required (Section 7-305) to be at a location appropriate to the purposes of the trust and the interests of its beneficiaries. Sections 7-102 and 7-305 provide for transfer of registration. The procedure is more flexible than the typical retained jurisdiction in that it permits registration or submission to other appropriate procedures at another place, even in another state, in order to accommodate relocation of the trust at a place which becomes more convenient for its administration. (Cf. 20 Pa. Stat. § 2080.309.) In addition, the registration acknowledges that a particular court will be accessible to the parties on a permissive basis without subjecting the trust to compulsory, continuing supervision by the court.
       </p>
       <p>
        The process of registration requires no judicial action or determination but is accomplished routinely by simple acts on the part of the trustee which will place certain information on file with the court (Section 7-102). Although proceedings involving a registered trust will not be continuous but will be separate each time an interested party initiates a proceeding, it is contemplated that a court will maintain a single file for each registered trust as a record available to interested persons. Proceedings are facilitated by the broad jurisdiction of the court (Section 7-201) and the Code’s representation and notice provisions (Section 1-403).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 7-201 provides complete jurisdiction over trust proceedings in the court of registration. Section 7-103 above provides for jurisdiction over parties. Section 7-104 should facilitate use of trusts involving assets in several states by providing for a single principal place of administration and reducing concern about qualification of foreign trust companies.

        This section rests on the assumption that a central “filing office” will be designated in each county where the Court may sit in more than one place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of this section and of Article VII [Chapter 7] is tied to the definition of “trustee” in section 1-201. It was suggested that the definition should be expanded to include “land trusts.” It was concluded, however, that the inclusion of this term, which has special meaning principally in Illinois, should be left for decision by enacting states. Under the definition of “trust” in this Code, custodial arrangements as contemplated by legislation dealing with gifts to minors, are excluded, as are “trust accounts” as defined in Article VI [Chapter 6].

      Registration shall be accomplished by filing a statement indicating the name and address of the trustee in which it acknowledges the trusteeship. The statement shall indicate whether the trust has been registered elsewhere. The statement shall identify the trust: (1) in the case of a testamentary trust, by the name of the testator and the date and place of domiciliary probate; (2) in the case of a written inter vivos trust, by the name of each settlor and the original trustee and the date of the trust instrument; or (3) in the case of an oral trust, by information identifying the settlor or other source of funds and describing the time and manner of the trust’s creation and the terms of the trust, including the subject matter, beneficiaries and time of performance. If a trust has been registered elsewhere, registration in this state is ineffective until the earlier registration is released by order of the court where prior registration occurred, or an instrument executed by the trustee and all beneficiaries, filed with the registration in this state.

       This section provides for jurisdiction over the parties. Subject matter jurisdiction for proceedings involving trusts is described in Sections 7-201 and 7-202. The basic jurisdictional concept in Section 7-103 is that reflected in widely adopted long-arm statutes, that a state may properly entertain proceedings when it is a reasonable forum under all the circumstances, provided adequate notice is given. Clearly the trustee can be deemed to consent to jurisdiction by virtue of registration. This basis for consent jurisdiction is in addition to and not in lieu of other bases of jurisdiction during or after registration. Also, incident to an order releasing registration under Section 7-305, the Court could condition the release on registration of the trust in another state or court. It also seems reasonable to require beneficiaries to go to the seat of the trust when litigation has been initiated there concerning a trust in which they claim beneficial interests, much as the rights of shareholders of a corporation can be determined at a corporate seat. The settlor has indicated a principal place of administration by his selection of a trustee or otherwise, and it is reasonable to subject rights under the trust to the jurisdiction of the Court where the trust is properly administered. Although most cases will fit within traditional concepts of jurisdiction, the section goes beyond established doctrines of in personam or quasi in rem jurisdiction as regards a nonresident beneficiary’s interests in foreign land of chattels, but the National Conference believes the section affords due process and represents a worthwhile step forward in trust proceedings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A trustee who fails to register a trust in a proper place as required by this Part, for purposes of any proceedings initiated by a beneficiary of the trust prior to registration, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of any court in which the trust could have been registered. In addition, any trustee who, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written demand by a settlor or beneficiary of the trust, fails to register a trust as required by this chapter is subject to removal and denial of compensation or to surcharge as the court may direct unless directed not to register by all beneficiaries or as provided in section 15-1-108[, Idaho Code,] of this code a person with a general power of appointment representing all the beneficiaries and acting for them. A provision in the terms of the trust purporting to excuse the trustee from the duty to register, or directing that the trust or trustee shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the court, is ineffective.

       Under Section 1-108, the holder of a presently exercisable general power of appointment can control all duties of a fiduciary to beneficiaries who may be changed by exercise of the power. Hence, if the settlor of a revocable inter vivos trust directs the trustee to refrain from registering a trust, no liability would follow even though another beneficiary demanded registration. The ability of the general power holder to control the trustee ends when the power is terminated.

     <p>
      A foreign corporate trustee is required to qualify as a foreign corporation doing business in this state if it maintains the principal place of administration of any trust within the state. A foreign cotrustee is not required to qualify in this state solely because its cotrustee maintains the principal place of administration in this state. Unless otherwise doing business in this state, local qualification by a foreign trustee, corporate or individual, is not required in order for the trustee to receive distribution from a local estate or to hold, invest in, manage or acquire property located in this state, or maintain litigation. Nothing in this section affects a determination of what other acts require qualification as doing business in this state.

       Section 7-105 deals with nonresident trustees in a fashion which should correct a widespread deficiency in present regulation of trust activity. Provisions limiting business of foreign corporate trustees constitute an unnecessary limitation on the ability of a trustee to function away from its principal place of business. These restrictions properly relate more to continuous pursuit of general trust business by foreign corporations than to isolated instances of litigation and management of the assets of a particular trust. The ease of avoiding foreign corporation qualification statutes by the common use of local nominees or subtrustees, and the acceptance of these practices, are evidence of the futility and undesirability of more restrictive legislation of the sort commonly existing today. The position embodied in this section has been recommended by important segments of the banking and trust industry through a proposed model statute, and the failure to adopt this reform has been characterized as unfortunate by a leading trust authority. See 5 Scott on Trusts § 558 (3rd ed. 1967).

       While recognizing that trusts which are essentially foreign can be the subject of proceedings in this state, this section employs the concept of forum non conveniens to center litigation involving the trustee and beneficiaries at the principal place of administration of the trust but leaves open the possibility of suit elsewhere when necessary in the interests of justice. It is assumed that under this section a court would refuse to entertain litigation involving the foreign registered trust unless for jurisdictional or other reasons, such as the nature and location of the property or unusual interests of the parties, it is manifest that substantial injustice would result if the parties were referred to the court of registration. As regards litigation involving third parties, the trustee may sue and be sued as any owner and manager of property under the usually applicable rules of civil procedure and also as provided in Section 7-203.
    The concepts of res judicata and full faith and credit applicable to any managing owner of property have generally been applicable to trustees. Consequently, litigation by trustees has not involved the artificial problems historically found when personal representatives maintain litigation away from the state of their appointment, and a prior adjudication for or against a trustee rendered in a foreign court having jurisdiction is viewed as conclusive and entitled to full faith and credit. Because of this, provisions changing the law, analogous to those relating to personal representatives in Section 4-401 do not appear necessary. See also Section 3-408. In light of the foregoing, the issue is essentially only one of forum non conveniens in having litigation proceed in the most appropriate forum. This is the function of this section.

       In view of the broad jurisdiction conferred on the probate court, description of the special proceeding authorized by this section might be unnecessary. But the Code’s theory that trustees may fix their own fees and those of their attorneys marks an important departure from much existing practice under which fees are determined by the Court in the first instance. Hence, it seems wise to emphasize that any interested person can get judicial review of fees if he desires it. Also, if excessive fees have been paid, this section provides a quick and efficient remedy. This review would meet in part the criticism of the broad powers given in the Uniform Trustees’ Powers Act.

       This is a new general provision designed to make clear the standard of skill expected from trustees both individual and corporate, nonprofessional and professional. It differs somewhat from the standard stated in Section 174 of the Restatement of Trusts, Second, which is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary in administering the trust to exercise such care and skill as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property; and if the trustee has or procures his appointment as trustee by representing that he has greater skill than that of a reasonable man of ordinary prudence, he is under a duty to exercise such skill.”
      </p>
      <p>
       By making the basic standard align to that observed by a prudent man in dealing with the property of another, the section accepts a standard as it has been articulated in some decisions regarding the duty of a trustee concerning investments. See
    Estate of Cook
    , (Del. Chanc. 1934) 20 Del. Ch. 123, 171 A. 730. Also, the duty as described by the above section more clearly conveys the idea that a trustee must comply with an external, rather than with a personal, standard of care.

        Analogous provisions are found in Section 3-705.
       </p>
       <p>
        This provision does not require regular accounting to the Court nor are copies of statements furnished beneficiaries required to be filed with the Court. The parties are expected to assume the usual ownership responsibility for their interests including their own record keeping. Under Section 1-108, the holder of a general power of appointment or of revocation can negate the trustee’s duties to any other person.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires that a reasonable selection of beneficiaries is entitled to information so that the interests of the future beneficiaries may adequately be protected. After mandatory notification of registration by the trustee to the beneficiaries, further information may be obtained by the beneficiary upon request. This is to avoid extensive mandatory formal accounts and yet provide the beneficiary with adequate protection and sources of information. In most instances, the trustee will provide beneficiaries with copies of annual tax returns or tax statements that must be filed. Usually this will be accompanied by a narrative explanation by the trustee. In the case of the charitable trust, notice need be given only to the attorney general or other state officer supervising charitable trusts and in the event that the charitable trust has, as its primary beneficiary, a charitable corporation or institution, notice should be given to that charitable corporation or institution. It is not contemplated that all of the individuals who may receive some benefit as a result of a charitable trust be informed.

       This section and Section 7-102 are related. The latter section makes it clear that registration may be released without Court order if the trustee and beneficiaries can agree on the matter. Section 1-108 may be relevant, also.
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary thrust of Article VII [Chapter 7] is to relate trust administration to the jurisdiction of courts, rather than to deal with substantive matters of trust law. An aspect of deviation, however, is touched here.

        The statutory modification of the common law rule by this section does not alter the trustee’s status as the holder of title to assets in the trust estate, nor does it make it necessary for the trustee to disclose his fiduciary capacity in executing documents that affect the trust estate; by implication this section recognizes that a trustee may effectively enter into contracts for trust purposes without disclosure of his fiduciary capacity.

       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to make the liability of the trust and trustee the same as that of the decedent’s estate and personal representative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimate liability as between the estate and the fiduciary need not necessarily be determined whenever there is doubt about this question. It should be permissible, and often it will be preferable, for judgment to be entered, for example, against the trustee individually for purposes of determining the claimant’s rights without the trustee placing that matter into controversy. The question of his right of reimbursement may be settled informally with beneficiaries or in a separate proceeding in the probate court involving reimbursement. The section does not preclude the possibility, however, that beneficiaries might be permitted to intervene in litigation between the trustee and a claimant and that all questions might be resolved in that action.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation, any claim against a trustee for breach of trust is barred as to any beneficiary who has received a final account or other statement fully disclosing the matter and showing termination of the trust relationship between the trustee and the beneficiary unless a proceeding to assert the claim is commenced within six (6) months after receipt of the final account or statement. In any event and notwithstanding lack of full disclosure a trustee who has issued a final account or statement received by the beneficiary and has informed the beneficiary of the location and availability of records for his examination is protected after three (3) years. A beneficiary is deemed to have received a final account or statement if, being an adult, it is received by him personally or if, being a minor or disabled person, it is received by his representative as described in subsections (a)(1) and (2) [paragraphs (b)(1) and (2)] of section 15-1-403[, Idaho Code,] of this code.

       Final accounts terminating the trustee’s obligations to the trust beneficiaries may be formal or informal. Formal judicial accountings may be initiated by the petition of any trustee or beneficiary. Informal accounts may be conclusive by consent or by limitation. This section provides a special limitation supporting informal accounts. With regard to facilitating distribution see Section 5-103.

       Section 1-108 makes approval of an informal account or settlement with a trustee by the holder of a presently exercisable general power of appointment binding on all beneficiaries.

The trustee shall give written notice of the proposed division or consolidation by personal service or by certified mail to all interested persons of every trust affected by the division or consolidation and to any trustee of such trust(s) who does not join in the notice. The notice shall: (i) state the name and mailing address of the trustee; (ii) include a copy of the governing instrument of each trust to be divided or consolidated; (iii) include a statement of assets and liabilities of each trust to be divided or consolidated, dated within ninety (90) days of the notice; (iv) fully describe the terms and manner of division or consolidation; and (v) state the reasons supporting the proposed division or consolidation. The notice shall advise the recipient of the right to petition for a judicial determination of the proposed division or consolidation as provided in subsection (3) of this section. The notice shall include a form on which consent or objection to the proposed division or consolidation may be indicated. If the trustee receives written consent to the proposed division or consolidation from all persons entitled to notice, the trustee may divide or consolidate the trusts as provided in the notice. Any person dealing with the trustee of the resulting divided or consolidated trust is entitled to rely on the authority of that trustee to act and is not obliged to inquire into the validity or propriety of the division or consolidation under this section.

If nonjudicial consolidation has been commenced pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, a petition may be filed under this section unless the trustee has received all necessary consents. The principal place of administration of the trust is the trustee’s usual place of business where the records pertaining to the trust are kept, or the trustee’s residence if the trustee has no such place of business. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that the requirements of subsections (2)(a), (b) and (c) of this section have been satisfied, it may direct division of one (1) or more trusts or consolidation of two (2) or more trusts on such terms and conditions as appropriate.

The provisions of this chapter are intended to provide nonjudicial methods for the resolution of matters by agreement. This chapter also provides for judicial resolution of disputes if a nonjudicial resolution is not obtained that are alternatives to the other provisions for resolution of contested matters under other chapters of title 15, Idaho Code. The provisions of this chapter shall not supersede, but shall supplement, any otherwise applicable provisions and procedures contained in title 15, Idaho Code, or other Idaho law.

        Limited Liability.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Provisions in a Trust and Estate Dispute Resolution Act (TEDRA) agreement, exculpating a party from liability, are enforceable only to the extent they settle past claims of negligence and of breaches of fiduciary duty committed before the agreement was executed. To the extent the provisions purport to exculpate the party from liability for future negligence or for breaches of fiduciary duty occurring after the TEDRA agreement, such provisions are void as against public policy.

Unless notice of a hearing is required to be given by publication, if all persons entitled to notice of the hearing waive the notice or appear at the hearing without objecting to the lack of proper notice or personal jurisdiction, the court may hear the matter immediately. A guardian or conservator or a guardian ad litem may make the waivers on behalf of the incapacitated person, and a trustee may make the waivers on behalf of any competent or incapacitated beneficiary of the trust.

     <p>
      Sections 15-8-301 through 15-8-305, Idaho Code, shall be applicable to the resolution of any matter, as defined in section 15-8-103, Idaho Code, other than matters subject to chapter 5, title 15, Idaho Code, or a trust for a minor or other incapacitated person created at its inception by the judgment or decree of a court unless the judgment or decree provides that sections 15-8-301 through 15-8-305, Idaho Code, shall be applicable. If all parties agree to a resolution of any such matter, then the agreement shall be evidenced by a written agreement signed by all parties. Subject to the provisions of section 15-8-304, Idaho Code, the written agreement shall be binding and conclusive on all persons interested in the estate or trust. The agreement shall identify the subject matter of the dispute and the parties. If the agreement or a memorandum of the agreement is to be filed with the court under section 15-8-303, Idaho Code, the agreement may, but need not, include provisions specifically addressing jurisdiction, governing law, the waiver of notice of the filing and the discharge of any special representative who has acted with respect to the agreement. If a party who virtually represents another person under section 15-8-205, Idaho Code, signs the agreement, then the party’s signature constitutes the signature of all persons whom the party virtually represents, and all the virtually represented persons shall be bound by the agreement.

       Any party, or a party’s legal representative, may file the written agreement or a memorandum summarizing the written agreement with the court having jurisdiction over the estate or trust. However, if a special representative is a party to the written agreement, the agreement or a memorandum of its terms may not be filed within thirty (30) days of the agreement’s execution by all parties unless the written consent of the special representative is filed along with, or included within, the provision of such agreement or memorandum. The agreement or a memorandum of its terms may be filed after a special representative has commenced a proceeding under section 15-8-304, Idaho Code, only after the court has determined that the special representative has adequately represented and protected the parties represented. Failure to complete any action authorized or required under this subsection does not cause the written agreement to be ineffective and the agreement is nonetheless binding and conclusive on all persons interested in the estate or trust.

      Within thirty (30) days of execution of the agreement by all parties, the special representative may notice a hearing for presentation of the written agreement to a court of competent jurisdiction. The special representative shall provide notice of the time and date of the hearing to each party to the agreement whose address is known, unless such notice has been waived. Proof of mailing or delivery of the notice must be filed with the court. At such hearing, the court shall review the agreement on behalf of the parties represented by the special representative. The court shall determine whether or not the interests of the represented parties have been adequately represented and protected, and an order declaring the court’s determination shall be entered. If the court determines that such interests have not been adequately represented and protected, the agreement shall be declared of no effect.

     PREFATORY NOTE
    </h4>
    <p>
     The catalyst for the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (the “Act”) was a national review of state power of attorney legislation. The review revealed growing divergence among states’ statutory treatment of powers of attorney. The original Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (“Original Act”), last amended in 1987, was at one time followed by all but a few jurisdictions. Despite initial uniformity, the review found that a majority of states had enacted non-uniform provisions to deal with specific matters upon which the Original Act is silent. The topics about which there was increasing divergence included: 1) the authority of multiple agents; 2) the authority of a later-appointed fiduciary or guardian; 3) the impact of dissolution or annulment of the principal’s marriage to the agent; 4) activation of contingent powers; 5) the authority to make gifts; and 6) standards for agent conduct and liability. Other topics about which states had legislated, although not necessarily in a divergent manner, included: successor agents, execution requirements, portability, sanctions for dishonor of a power of attorney, and restrictions on authority that has the potential to dissipate a principal’s property or alter a principal’s estate plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     A national survey was then conducted by the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trust and Estate Acts (JEB) to ascertain whether there was actual divergence of opinion about default rules for powers of attorney or only the lack of a detailed uniform model. The survey was distributed to probate and elder law sections of all state bar associations, to the fellows of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel, the leadership of the ABA Section of Real Property, Probate and Trust Law and the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, as well as to special interest list serves of the ABA Commission on Law and Aging. Forty-four jurisdictions were represented in the 371 surveys returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     The survey responses demonstrated a consensus of opinion in excess of seventy percent that a power of attorney statute should:

    <p>
     Informed by the review and the survey results, the Conference’s drafting process also incorporated input from the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel, the ABA Section of Real Property, Probate and Trust Law, the ABA Commission on Law and Aging, the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trust and Estate Acts, the National Conference of Lawyers and Corporate Fiduciaries, the American Bankers Association, AARP, other professional groups, as well as numerous individual lawyers and corporate counsel. As a result of this process, the Act codifies both state legislative trends and collective best practices, and strikes a balance between the need for flexibility and acceptance of an agent’s authority and the need to prevent and redress financial abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the Act contains safeguards for the protection of an incapacitated principal, the Act is primarily a set of default rules that preserve a principal’s freedom to choose both the extent of an agent’s authority and the principles to govern the agent’s conduct. Among the Act’s features that enhance drafting flexibility are the statutory definitions of powers in Article 2, which can be incorporated by reference in an individually drafted power of attorney or selected for inclusion on the optional statutory form provided in Article 3. The statutory definitions of enumerated powers are an updated version of those in the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act (1988), which the Act supersedes. The national review found that eighteen jurisdictions had adopted some type of statutory form power of attorney. The decision to include a statutory form power of attorney in the Act was based on this trend and the proliferation of power of attorney forms currently available to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 119 [§ 15-12-119] and 120 [§ 15-12-120] of the Act address the problem of persons refusing to accept an agent’s authority. Section 119 [§ 15-12-119] provides protection from liability for persons that in good faith accept an acknowledged power of attorney. Section 120 [§ 15-12-120] sanctions refusal to accept an acknowledged power of attorney unless the refusal meets limited statutory exceptions.

     In exchange for mandated acceptance of an agent’s authority, the Act does not require persons that deal with an agent to investigate the agent or the agent’s actions. Instead, safeguards against abuse are provided through heightened requirements for granting authority that could dissipate the principal’s property or alter the principal’s estate plan (Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)]), provisions that set out the agent’s duties and liabilities (Sections 114 and 117 [§§ 15-12-114 and 15-12-117]) and by specification of the categories of persons that have standing to request judicial review of the agent’s conduct (Section 116 [§ 15-12-116]). The following provides a brief overview of the entire Act.
     Overview of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act
    </h5>
    <p>
     The Act consists of 4 articles. The basic substance of the Act is located in Articles 1 and 2. Article 3 contains the optional statutory form and Article 4 consists of miscellaneous provisions dealing with general application of the Act and repeal of certain prior acts.

     Article 1 — General Provisions and Definitions
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p class="">
    Article 1 — General Provisions and Definitions — Section 102 [§ 15-12-102] lists definitions which are useful in interpretation of the Act. Of particular note is the definition of “incapacity” which replaces the term “disability” used in the Original Act. The definition of “incapacity” is consistent with the standard for appointment of a conservator under Section 401 of the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act as amended in 1997. Another significant change in terminology from the Original Act is the use of “agent” in place of the term “attorney in fact.” The term “agent” was also used in the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act (1988) and is intended to clarify confusion in the lay public about the meaning of “attorney in fact.” Section 103 [§ 15-12-103] provides that the Act is to apply broadly to all powers of attorney, but excepts from the Act powers of attorney for health care and certain specialized powers such as those coupled with an interest or dealing with proxy voting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another innovation is the default rule in Section 104 [§ 15-12-104] that a power of attorney is durable unless it contains express language indicating otherwise. This change from the Original Act reflects the view that most principals prefer their powers of attorney to be durable as a hedge against the need for guardianship. While the Original Act was silent on execution requirements for a power of attorney, Section 105 [§ 15-12-105] requires the principal’s signature and provides that an acknowledged signature is presumed genuine. Section 106 recognizes military powers of attorney and powers of attorney properly executed in other states or countries, or which were properly executed in the state of enactment prior to the Act’s effective date. Section 107 [§ 15-12-107] states a choice of law rule for determining the law that governs the meaning and effect of a power of attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 108 [§ 15-12-108] addresses the relationship of the agent to a later court-appointed fiduciary. The Original Act conferred upon a conservator or other later-appointed fiduciary the same power to revoke or amend the power of attorney as the principal would have had prior to incapacity. In contrast, the Act reserves this power to the court and states that the agent’s authority continues until limited, suspended, or terminated by the court. This approach reflects greater deference for the previously expressed preferences of the principal and is consistent with the state legislative trend that has departed from the Original Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     The default rule for when a power of attorney becomes effective is stated in Section 109. [§ 15-12-109] Unless the principal specifies that it is to become effective upon a future date, event, or contingency, the authority of an agent under a power of attorney becomes effective when the power is executed. Section 109 [§ 15-12-109] permits the principal to designate who may determine when contingent powers are triggered. If the trigger for contingent powers is the principal’s incapacity, Section 109 [§ 15-12-109] provides that the person designated to make that determination has the authority to act as the principal’s personal representative under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for purposes of accessing the principal’s health-care information and communicating with the principal’s health-care provider. This provision does not, however, confer on the designated person the authority to make health-care decisions for the principal. If the trigger for contingent powers is incapacity but the principal has not designated anyone to make the determination, or the person authorized is unable or unwilling to make the determination, the determination may be made by a physician or licensed psychologist, who must find that the principal’s ability to manage property or business affairs is impaired, or by an attorney at law, judge, or appropriate governmental official, who must find that the principal is missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States.
    The bases for termination of a power of attorney are covered in Section 110 [§ 15-12-110]. In response to concerns expressed in the JEB survey, the Act provides as the default rule that authority granted to a principal’s spouse is revoked upon the commencement of proceedings for legal separation, marital dissolution or annulment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 111 through 118 [§§ 15-12-111 through 15-12-118] address matters related to the agent, including default rules for coagents and successor agents (Section 111 [§ 15-12-111]), reimbursement and compensation (Section 112 [§ 15-12-112]), an agent’s acceptance of appointment (Section 113 [§ 15-12-113]), and the agent’s duties (Section 114 [§ 15-12-114]). Section 115 [§ 15-12-115] provides that a principal may lower the standard of liability for agent conduct subject to a minimum level of accountability for actions taken dishonestly, with an improper motive, or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the power of attorney or the best interest of the principal. Section 116 [§ 15-12-116] sets out a comprehensive list of persons that may petition the court to review the agent’s conduct and Section 117 [§ 15-12-117] addresses agent liability. An agent may resign by following the notice procedures described in Section 118 [§ 15-12-118].
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 119 and 120 [§ 15-12-119 and 15-12-120] are included in the Act to address the frequently reported problem of persons refusing to accept a power of attorney. Section 119 [§ 15-12-119] protects persons that in good faith accept an acknowledged power of attorney without actual knowledge that the power of attorney is revoked, terminated, or invalid or that the agent is exceeding or improperly exercising the agent’s powers. Subject to statutory exceptions, alternative Sections 120 [§ 15-12-120] impose liability for refusal to accept a power of attorney. Alternative A sanctions refusal of an acknowledged power of attorney and Alternative B sanctions only refusal of an acknowledged statutory form power of attorney [Idaho adopted Alternative A.].
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 121 through 123 [§§ 15-12-121 through 15-12-123] address the relationship of the Act to other law. Section 121 [§ 15-12-121] clarifies that the Act is supplemented by the principles of common law and equity to the extent those principles are not displaced by a specific provision of the Act, and Section 122 [§ 15-12-122] further clarifies that the Act is not intended to supersede any law applicable to financial institutions or other entities. With respect to remedies, Section 123 [§ 15-12-123] provides that the remedies under the Act are not exclusive and do not abrogate any other cause of action or remedy that may be available under the law of the enacting jurisdiction.

     Article 2 — Authority
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p class="">
    Article 2 — Authority — The Act offers the drafting attorney enhanced flexibility whether drafting an individually tailored power of attorney or using the statutory form. Like the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act, Sections 204 through 217 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-217] of the Act set forth detailed descriptions of authority relating to subjects such as “real property,” “retirement plans,” and “taxes,” which a principal, pursuant to Section 202 [§ 15-12-202], may incorporate in full into the power of attorney either by a reference to the short descriptive term for the subject used in the Act or to the section number. Section 202 [§ 15-12-202] further states that a principal may modify in a power of attorney any authority incorporated by reference. The definitions in Article 2 also provide meaning for authority with respect to subjects enumerated on the optional statutory form in Article 3. Section 203 applies to all incorporated authority and grants of general authority, providing further detail on how the authority is to be construed. Article 2 also addresses concerns about authority that might be used to dissipate the principal’s property or alter the principal’s estate plan. Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)] lists specific categories of authority that cannot be implied from a grant of general authority, but which may be granted only through express language in the power of attorney. Section 201(b) [§ 15-12-201(2)] contains a default rule prohibiting an agent that is not an ancestor, spouse, or descendant of the principal from creating in the agent or in a person to whom the agent owes a legal obligation of support an interest in the principal’s property, whether by gift, right of survivorship, beneficiary designation, disclaimer, or otherwise.

In the section of the form addressing general authority, the principal must initial the subjects over which the principal wishes to delegate general authority to the agent. In the section of the form addressing specific authority, the Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)] categories of specific authority are listed, preceded by a warning to the principal about the potential consequences of granting such authority to an agent. The principal is instructed to initial only the specific categories of actions that the principal intends to authorize. Article 3 also contains a sample agent certification form.

      <p>
       The Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006) replaces the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (1979/1987) (formerly codified at Article V, Part 5 of the Uniform Probate Code), and the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act (1988). The primary purpose of the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (1979/1987) was to provide individuals with an inexpensive, non-judicial method of surrogate property management in the event of later incapacity. Two key concepts were introduced by the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act: 1) creation of a durable agency — one that survives, or is triggered by, the principal’s incapacity, and 2) validation of post-mortem exercise of powers by an agent who acts in good faith and without actual knowledge of the principal’s death. The success of the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (1979/1987) is evidenced by the widespread use of durable powers in every jurisdiction, not only for incapacity planning, but also for convenience while the principal retains capacity. However, the limitations of the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (1979/1987) are evidenced by the number of states that have supplemented and revised their statutes to address myriad issues upon which the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (1979/1987) is silent. These issues include parameters for the creation and use of powers of attorney as well as guidelines for the principal, the agent, and the person who is asked to accept the agent’s authority. The general provisions and definitions of Article 1 in the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006) (codified as Article 5B of the Uniform Probate Code (2011)), address those issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to providing greater detail than the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (1979/1987), this Act changes two presumptions in the earlier act: 1) that a power of attorney is not durable unless it contains language to make it durable; and 2) that a later court-appointed fiduciary for the principal has the power to revoke or amend a previously executed power of attorney. Section 104 [§ 15-12-104] of this Article reverses the non-durability presumption by stating that a power of attorney is durable unless it expressly provides that it is terminated by the incapacity of the principal. Section 108 gives deference to the principal’s choice of agent by providing that if a court appoints a fiduciary to manage some or all of the principal’s property, the agent’s authority continues unless limited, suspended, or terminated by the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Act is primarily a default statute, Article 1 also contains rules that govern all powers of attorney subject to the Act. Examples of these rules include imposition of certain minimum fiduciary duties on an agent who has accepted appointment (Section 114(a) [§ 15-12-114(1)]), recognition of persons who have standing to request judicial construction of the power of attorney or review of the agent’s conduct (Section 116 [§ 15-12-116]), and protections for persons who accept an acknowledged power of attorney without actual knowledge that the power of attorney or the agent’s authority is void, invalid, or terminated, or that the agent is exceeding or improperly exercising the power (Section 119 [§ 15-12-119]). In contrast with the rules of general application in Article 1, the default provisions are clearly indicated by signals such as “unless the power of attorney otherwise provides,” or “except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney.” These signals alert the draftsperson to options for enlarging or limiting the Act’s default terms. For example, default provisions in Article 1 state that, unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, the power of attorney is effective immediately (Section 109 [§ 15-12-109]), coagents may exercise their authority independently (Section 111 [§ 15-12-111]), and an agent is entitled to reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred and to reasonable compensation (Section 112 [§ 15-12-112]).
    This Act, which replaces the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (1979/1987), does not contain the word “durable” in the title. Pursuant to Section 104 [§ 15-12-104], a power of attorney created under the Act is durable unless the power of attorney provides that it is terminated by the incapacity of the principal.

       <p>
        Although most of the definitions in Section 102 [this section] are self-explanatory, a few of the terms warrant further comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Agent” replaces the term “attorney in fact” used in the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act to avoid confusion in the lay public about the meaning of the term and the difference between an attorney in fact and an attorney at law. Agent was also used in the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act which this Act supersedes.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Incapacity” replaces the term “disability” used in the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act in recognition that disability does not necessarily render an individual incapable of property and business management. The definition of incapacity stresses the operative consequences of the individual’s impairment-inability to manage property and business affairs-rather than the impairment itself. The definition of incapacity in the Act is also consistent with the standard for appointment of a conservator under Section 401 of the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act as amended in 1997.
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of “power of attorney” clarifies that the term applies to any grant of authority in a writing or other record from a principal to an agent which appears from the grant to be a power of attorney, without regard to whether the words “power of attorney” are actually used in the grant.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Presently exercisable general power of appointment” is defined to clarify that where the phrase appears in the Act it does not include a power exercisable by the principal in a fiduciary capacity or exercisable only by will.
    Cf.
    Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills and Don. Trans.) § 19.8 cmt. d (Tentative Draft No. 5, approved 2006) (noting that unless the donor of a presently exercisable power of attorney has manifested a contrary intent, it is assumed that the donor intends that the donee’s agent be permitted to exercise the power for the benefit of the donee). Including in a power of attorney the authority to exercise a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by the principal is consistent with the objective of giving an agent comprehensive management authority over the principal’s property and financial affairs. The term appears in Section 211 [§ 15-12-211] (Estates, Trusts, and Other Beneficial Interests) in the context of authority to exercise for the benefit of the principal a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by the principal (
    <i>

    </i>
    Section 211(b)(3) [§ 15-12-211(2)(c)]), and in Section 217 [§ 15-12-217] (Gifts) in the context of authority to exercise for the benefit of someone else a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by the principal (
    <i>
     see
    </i>
    Section 217(b)(1) [§ 15-12-217(2)(a)]). The term is also incorporated by reference when using the statutory form in Section 301 [§ 15-12-301] to grant authority with respect to “Estates, Trusts, and Other Beneficial Interests” or authority with respect to “Gifts.” If a principal wishes to delegate authority to exercise a power that the principal holds in a fiduciary capacity, Section 201(a)(7) [§ 15-12-201(1)(g)] requires that the power of attorney contain an express grant of such authority. Furthermore, delegation of a power held in a fiduciary capacity is possible only if the principal has authority to delegate the power, and the agent’s authority is necessarily limited by whatever terms govern the principal’s ability to exercise the power.

        The Uniform Power of Attorney Act is intended to be comprehensive with respect to delegation of surrogate decision making authority over an individual’s property and property interests, whether for the purpose of incapacity planning or mere convenience. Given that an agent will likely exercise authority at times when the principal cannot monitor the agent’s conduct, the Act specifies minimum agent duties and protections for the principal’s benefit. These provisions, however, may not be appropriate for all delegations of authority that might otherwise be included within the definition of a power of attorney. Section 103 [this section] lists delegations of authority that are excluded from the Act because the subject matter of the delegation, the objective of the delegation, the agent’s role with respect to the delegation, or a combination of the foregoing, would make application of the Act’s provisions inappropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (1) excludes a power to the extent that it is coupled with an interest in the subject of the power. This exclusion addresses situations where, due to the agent’s interest in the subject matter of the power, the agent is not intended to act as the principal’s fiduciary.
    See
    Restatement (Third) of Agency § 3.12 (2006) and M.T. Brunner, Annotation,
        What Constitutes Power Coupled with Interest within Rule as to Termination of Agency
        , 28 A.L.R.2d 1243 (1953). Common examples of powers coupled with an interest include powers granted to a creditor to perfect or protect title in, or to sell, pledged collateral. While the example of “a power given to or for the benefit of a creditor in connection with a credit transaction” is highlighted in paragraph (1), it is not meant to exclude application of paragraph (1) to other contexts in which a power may be coupled with an interest, such as a power held by an insurer to settle or confess judgment on behalf of an insured.
        See, e.g., Hayes v. Gessner
        , 52 N.E.2d 968 (Mass. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (2) excludes from the Act delegations of authority to make health-care decisions for the principal. Such delegations are covered under other law of the jurisdiction. The Act recognizes, however, that matters of financial management and health-care decision making are often interdependent. The Act consequently provides in Section 114(b)(5) [§ 15-12-114(2)(e)] a default rule that an agent under the Act must cooperate with the principal’s health-care decision maker.
       </p>
       <p>
        Likewise, paragraph (3) excludes from the Act a proxy or other delegation to exercise voting rights or management rights with respect to an entity. The rules with respect to those rights are typically controlled by entity-specific statutes within a jurisdiction.
    See, e.g.
    , Model Bus. Corp. Act § 7.22 (2002); Unif. Ltd. Partnership Act § 118 (2001); and Unif. Ltd. Liability Co. Act § 404(e) (1996). Notwithstanding the exclusion of such delegations from the operation of this Act, Section 209 [§ 15-12-209] contemplates that a power granted to an agent with respect to operation of an entity or business includes the authority to “exercise in person or by proxy . . . a right, power, privilege, or option the principal has or claims to have as the holder of stocks and bonds. . . .” (
    <i>
     see
    </i>
    paragraph (5) of Section 209 [§ 15-12-209]). Thus, while a person that holds only a proxy pursuant to an entity voting statute will not be subject to the provisions of this Act, an agent that is granted Section 209 [§ 15-12-209] authority is subject to the Act because the principal has given the agent authority that is greater than that of a mere voting proxy. In fact, typical entity statutes contemplate that a principal’s agent or “attorney in fact” may appoint a proxy on behalf of the principal.
    <i>
     See, e.g.
    </i>
    , Model Bus. Corp. Act § 7.22 (2002); Unif. Ltd. Partnership Act § 118 (2001); and Unif. Ltd. Liability Co. Act § 404(e) (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (4) excludes from the Act any power created on a governmental form for a governmental purpose. Like the excluded powers in paragraphs (2) and (3), the authority for a power created on a governmental form emanates from other law and is generally for a limited purpose. Notwithstanding this exclusion, the Act specifically provides in paragraph (7) of Section 203 [§ 15-12-203] that a grant of authority to an agent includes, with respect to that subject matter, authority to “prepare, execute, and file a record, report, or other document to safeguard or promote the principal’s interest under a statute or governmental regulation.” Section 203 [§ 15-12-203], paragraph (8), further clarifies that the agent has the authority to “communicate with any representative or employee of a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, on behalf of the principal.” The intent of these provisions is to minimize the need for a special power on a governmental form with respect to any subject matter over which an agent is granted authority under the Act.

       Section 104 [this section] establishes that a power of attorney created under the Act is durable unless it expressly states otherwise. This default rule is the reverse of the approach under the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act and based on the assumption that most principals prefer durability as a hedge against the need for guardianship.
    See also
    Section 107 [§ 15-12-107] Comment (noting that the default rules of the jurisdiction’s law under which a power of attorney is created, including the default rule for durability, govern the meaning and effect of a power of attorney).

        While notarization of the principal’s signature is not required to create a valid power of attorney, this section strongly encourages the practice by according acknowledged signatures a statutory presumption of genuineness. Furthermore, because Section 119 [§ 15-12-119] (Acceptance of and Reliance Upon Acknowledged Power of Attorney) and alternative Sections 120 [§ 15-12-120] (Alternative A — Liability for Refusal to Accept Acknowledged Power of Attorney, and Alternative B — Liability for Refusal to Accept Acknowledged Statutory Form Power of Attorney) do not apply to unacknowledged powers, persons who are presented with an unacknowledged power of attorney may be reluctant to accept it. As a practical matter, an acknowledged signature is required if the power of attorney will be recorded by the agent in conjunction with the execution of real estate documents on behalf of the principal.
    See
    R.P.D., Annotation,
    <i>
     Recording Laws as Applied to Power of Attorney under which Deed or Mortgage is Executed

    , 114 A.L.R. 660 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, at a minimum, requires that the power of attorney be signed by the principal or by another individual who the principal has directed to sign the principal’s name. If another individual is directed to sign the principal’s name, the signing must occur in the principal’s “conscious presence.” The 1990 amendments to the Uniform Probate Code codified the “conscious presence” test for the execution of wills (Section 2-502(a)(2)), which generally requires that the signing is sufficient if it takes place within the range of the senses — usually sight or hearing — of the individual who directed that another sign the individual’s name.

        One of the purposes of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act is promotion of the portability and use of powers of attorney. Section 106 [this section] makes clear that the Act does not affect the validity of pre-existing powers of attorney executed under prior law in the enacting jurisdiction, powers of attorney validly created under the law of another jurisdiction, and military powers of attorney. While the effect of this section is to recognize the validity of powers of attorney created under other law, it does not abrogate the traditional grounds for contesting the validity of execution such as forgery, fraud, or undue influence.

        This section also provides that unless another law in the jurisdiction requires presentation of the original power of attorney, a photocopy or electronically transmitted copy has the same effect as the original. An example of another law that might require presentation of the original power of attorney is the jurisdiction’s recording act.

       This section recognizes that a foreign power of attorney, or one executed before the effective date of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act, may have been created under different default rules than those in this Act. Section 107 [this section] provides that the meaning and effect of a power of attorney is to be determined by the law under which it was created. For example, the law in another jurisdiction may provide for different default rules with respect to durability of a power of attorney (
    see
    Section 104 [§ 15-12-104]), the authority of coagents (
    <i>
     see
    </i>
    Section 111 [§ 15-12-111]) or the scope of specific authority such as the authority to make gifts (
    <i>
     see
    </i>
    Section 217 [§ 15-12-217]). Section 107 [this section] clarifies that the principal’s intended grant of authority will be neither enlarged nor narrowed by virtue of the agent using the power in a different jurisdiction. For a discussion of the issues that can arise with inter-jurisdictional use of powers of attorney,

      </p>
      <p>
       This section also establishes an objective means for determining what jurisdiction’s law the principal intended to govern the meaning and effect of a power of attorney. The phrase, “the law of the jurisdiction indicated in the power of attorney,” is intentionally broad, and includes any statement or reference in a power of attorney that indicates the principal’s choice of law. Examples of an indication of jurisdiction include a reference to the name of the jurisdiction in the title or body of the power of attorney, citation to the jurisdiction’s power of attorney statute, or an explicit statement that the power of attorney is created or executed under the laws of a particular jurisdiction. In the absence of an indication of jurisdiction in the power of attorney, Section 107 [this section] provides that the law of the jurisdiction in which the power of attorney was executed controls. The distinction between “the law of the jurisdiction indicated in the power of attorney” and “the law of the jurisdiction in which the power of attorney was executed” is an important one. The common practice of property ownership in more than one jurisdiction increases the likelihood that a principal may execute in one jurisdiction a power of attorney that was created and intended to be interpreted under the laws of another jurisdiction. A clear indication of the jurisdiction’s law that is intended to govern the meaning and effect of a power of attorney is therefore advisable in all powers of attorney.
    See, e.g.
    , Section 301 [§ 15-12-301] (providing for the name of the jurisdiction to appear in the title of the statutory form power of attorney).

        Section 108(b) [subsection (2)] is a departure from the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act which gave a court-appointed fiduciary the same power to revoke or amend a power of attorney as the principal would have if not incapacitated.
    See
    Unif. Durable Power of Atty. Act § 3(a) (1987). In contrast, this Act gives deference to the principal’s choice of agent by providing that the agent’s authority continues, notwithstanding the later court appointment of a fiduciary, unless the court acts to limit or terminate the agent’s authority. [But, see 2013 amendment of this section.] This approach assumes that the later-appointed fiduciary’s authority should supplement, not truncate, the agent’s authority. If, however, a fiduciary appointment is required because of the agent’s inadequate performance or breach of fiduciary duties, the court, having considered this evidence during the appointment proceedings, may limit or terminate the agent’s authority contemporaneously with appointment of the fiduciary. Section 108(b) [subsection (2)] is consistent with the state legislative trend that has departed from the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act. See, e.g., 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 45/2-10 (1992); Ind. Code Ann.<cite class="id_code">§ 30-5</cite>-3-4 (1994); Kan. Stat. Ann.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.58.html#t58c06s58-662" target="_blank">§ 58-662 </a></cite>(2005); Mo. Ann. Stat. § 404.727 (2001); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 46:2B-8.4 (2003); N.M. Stat. Ann.<cite class="id_code">§ 45-5</cite>-503A (2004); Utah Code Ann.<cite class="id_code">§ 75-5</cite>-501 (2006); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, § 3509(a) (2002); Va. Code Ann.<cite class="id_code">§ 11-9</cite>.1B (2006). Section 108(b) is also consistent with the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act § 6(a) (1993), which provides that a guardian may not revoke the ward’s advance health-care directive unless the court appointing the guardian expressly so authorizes. Furthermore, it is consistent with the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act (1997), which provides that a guardian or conservator may not revoke the ward’s or protected person’s power of attorney for health-care or financial management without first obtaining express authority of the court.
    <i>
     See Unif.
    </i>
    Guardianship &amp; Protective Proc. Act § 316(c) (guardianship), § 411(d) (protective proceedings).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deference for the principal’s autonomous choice is evident both in the presumption that an agent’s authority continues unless limited or terminated by the court, and in the directive that the court shall appoint a fiduciary in accordance with the principal’s most recent nomination (
    see
    subsection (a) [(1)]). Typically, a principal will nominate as conservator or guardian the same individual named as agent under the power of attorney. Favoring the principal’s choice of agent and nominee, an approach consistent with most statutory hierarchies for guardian selection (
        see
        Unif. Guardianship & Protective Proc. Act § 310(a)(2) (1997)), also discourages guardianship petitions filed for the sole purpose of thwarting the agent’s authority to gain control over a vulnerable principal.
        See
        Unif. Guardianship & Protective Proc. Act § 310 cmt. (1997).

        This section establishes a default rule that a power of attorney is effective when executed. If the principal chooses to create what is commonly known as a “springing” or contingent power of attorney-one that becomes effective at a future date or upon a future event or contingency-the principal may authorize the agent or someone else to provide written verification that the event or contingency has occurred (subsection (b) [(2)]). Because the person authorized to verify the principal’s incapacitation will likely need access to the principal’s health information, subsection (d) [(4)] qualifies that person to act as the principal’s “personal representative” for purposes of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
    See
    45 C.F.R. § 164.502(g)(1)-(2) (2006) (providing that for purposes of disclosing an individual’s protected health information, “a covered entity must . . . treat a personal representative as the individual”). Section 109 [this section] does not, however, empower the agent to make health-care decisions for the principal.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 103 [§ 15-12-103] and comment (discussing exclusion from this Act of powers to make health-care decisions).
       </p>
       <p>
        The default rule reflects a “best practices” philosophy that any agent who can be trusted to act for the principal under a springing power of attorney should be trustworthy enough to hold an immediate power. Survey evidence suggests, however, that a significant number of principals still prefer springing powers, most likely to maintain privacy in the hope that they will never need a surrogate decision maker. See Linda S. Whitton,
    National Durable Power of Attorney Survey Results and Analysis
    , National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, 6-7 (2002),
        http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/dpoaa/surveyoct2002.htm
        (reporting that 23% of lawyer respondents found their clients preferred springing powers, 61% reported a preference for immediate powers, and 16% saw no trend; however, 89% stated that a power of attorney statute should authorize springing powers).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the principal’s incapacity is the trigger for a springing power of attorney and the principal has not authorized anyone to make that determination, or the authorized person is unable or unwilling to make the determination, this section provides a default mechanism to trigger the power. Incapacity based on the principal’s impairment may be verified by a physician or licensed psychologist (subsection (c)(1) [(3)(a)]), and incapacity based on the principal’s unavailability (
    i.e.
    , the principal is missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States) may be verified by an attorney at law, judge, or an appropriate governmental official (subsection (c)(2) [(3)(b)]). Examples of appropriate governmental officials who may be in a position to determine that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of Section 102(5)(b) include an officer acting under authority of the United States Department of State or uniformed services of the United States or a sworn federal or state law enforcement officer. The default mechanism for triggering a power of attorney is available only when no incapacity determination has been made. It is not available to challenge the determination made by the principal’s authorized designee.

        This section addresses termination of a power of attorney or an agent’s authority under a power of attorney. It first lists termination events (
    see
    subsections (a) and (b) [(1) and (2)]), and then lists circumstances that, in contrast, either do not invalidate the power of attorney (
        see
        subsections (c) and (f) [(3) and (6)]) or the actions taken pursuant to the power of attorney (
        see
        subsections (d) and (e) [(4) and (5)]).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) [(3)] provides that a power of attorney under the Act does not become “stale.” Unless a power of attorney provides for termination upon a certain date or after the passage of a period of time, lapse of time since execution is irrelevant to validity, a concept carried over from the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act.
    See
    Unif. Durable Power of Atty. Act § 1 (as amended in 1987). Similarly, subsection (f) [(6)] clarifies that a subsequently executed power of attorney will not revoke a prior power of attorney by virtue of inconsistency alone. To effect a revocation, a subsequently executed power of attorney must expressly revoke a previously executed power of attorney or state that all other powers of attorney are revoked. The requirement of express revocation prevents inadvertent revocation when the principal intends for one agent to have limited authority that overlaps with broader authority held by another agent. For example, the principal who has given one agent a very broad power of attorney, including general authority with respect to real property, may later wish to give another agent limited authority to execute closing documents with respect to out-of-town real estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsections (d) and (e) [(4) and (5)] emphasize that even a termination event is not effective as to the agent or person who, without actual knowledge of the termination event, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. For example, the principal’s death terminates a power of attorney (
    see
    subsection (a)(1) [(1)(a)]), but an agent who acts in good faith under a power of attorney without actual knowledge of the principal’s death will bind the principal’s successors in interest with that action (
    <i>
     see
    </i>
    subsection (d)[(4)]). The same result is true if the agent knows of the principal’s death, but the person who accepts the agent’s apparent authority has no actual knowledge of the principal’s death.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Restatement (Third) of Agency § 3.11 (2006) (stating that “termination of actual authority does not by itself end any apparent authority held by an agent”).
    <i>
     See also
    </i>
    Section 119(c) [§ 15-12-119(3)] (stating that “[a] person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of attorney without actual knowledge that the power of attorney is . . . terminated . . . may rely upon the power of attorney as if the power of attorney were . . . still in effect . . . .”). These concepts are also carried forward from the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Unif. Durable Power Atty. Act § 4 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Of special note in the list of termination events is subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)] which provides that a spouse-agent’s authority is revoked when an action is filed for the dissolution or annulment of the agent’s marriage to the principal, or their legal separation. Although the filing of an action for dissolution or annulment might render a principal particularly vulnerable to self-interested actions by a spouse-agent, subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)] is not mandatory and may be overridden in the power of attorney. There may be special circumstances precipitating the dissolution, such as catastrophic illness and the need for public benefits, that would prompt the principal to specify that the agent’s authority continues notwithstanding dissolution, annulment or legal separation.

       This section provides several default rules that merit careful consideration by the principal. Subsection (a) [(1)] states that if a principal names coagents, each coagent may exercise its authority independently unless otherwise directed in the power of attorney. The Act adopts this default position to discourage the practice of executing separate, co-extensive powers of attorney in favor of different agents, and to facilitate transactions with persons who are reluctant to accept a power of attorney from only one of two or more named agents. This default rule should not, however, be interpreted as encouraging the practice of naming coagents. For a principal who can still monitor the activities of an agent, naming coagents multiplies monitoring responsibilities and significantly increases the risk that inconsistent actions will be taken with the principal’s property. For the incapacitated principal, the risk is even greater that coagents will use the power of attorney to vie for control of the principal and the principal’s property. Although the principal can override the default rule by requiring coagents to act by majority or unanimous consensus, such a requirement impedes use of the power of attorney, especially among agents who do not share close physical or philosophical proximity. A more prudent practice is generally to name one original agent and one or more successor agents. If desirable, a principal may give the original agent authority to delegate the agent’s authority during periods when the agent is temporarily unavailable to serve (
    see
    Section 201(a)(5) [§ 15-12-201(1)(e)]).
    Subsection (b) [(2)] states that unless a power of attorney otherwise provides, a successor agent has the same authority as that granted to the original agent. While this default provision ensures that the scope of authority granted to the original agent can be carried forward by successors, a principal may want to consider whether a successor agent is an appropriate person to exercise all of the authority given to the original agent. For example, authority to make gifts, to create, amend, or revoke an inter vivos trust, or to create or change survivorship and beneficiary designations (

       Subsection (c) [(3)] provides a default rule that an agent is not liable for the actions of another agent unless the agent participates in or conceals the breach of fiduciary duty committed by that other agent. Consequently, absent specification to the contrary in the power of attorney, an agent has no duty to monitor another agent’s conduct. However, subsection (d) [(4)] does require that an agent that has actual knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary duty must notify the principal, and if the principal is incapacitated, take reasonably appropriate action to safeguard the principal’s best interest. Subsection (d) [(4)] provides that if an agent fails to notify the principal or to take action to safeguard the principal’s best interest, that agent is only liable for the reasonably foreseeable damages that could have been avoided had the agent provided the required notification.

       This section provides a default rule that an agent is entitled to reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred on behalf of the principal and to reasonable compensation. While it is unlikely that a principal would choose to alter the default rule as to expenses, a principal’s circumstances may warrant including limitations in the power of attorney as to the categories of expenses the agent may incur; likewise, the principal may choose to specify the terms of compensation rather than leave that determination to a reasonableness standard. Although many family-member agents serve without compensation, payment of compensation to the agent may be advantageous to the principal in circumstances where the principal needs to spend down income or resources to meet qualifications for public benefits.

       This section establishes a default rule for agent acceptance of appointment under a power of attorney. Unless a different method is provided in the power of attorney, an agent’s acceptance occurs upon exercise of authority, performance of duties, or any other assertion or conduct indicating acceptance. Acceptance is the critical reference point for commencement of the agency relationship and the imposition of fiduciary duties (
    see
    Section 114(a) [§ 15-12-114(1)]). Because a person may be unaware that the principal has designated the person as an agent in a power of attorney, clear demarcation of when an agency relationship commences is necessary to protect both the principal and the agent.

       Although well settled that an agent under a power of attorney is a fiduciary, there is little clarity in state power of attorney statutes about what that means.
    See generally
    Karen E. Boxx,
       The Durable Power of Attorney’s Place in the Family of Fiduciary Relationships
       , 36 Ga. L. Rev. 1 (2001); Carolyn L. Dessin,
       Acting as Agent under a Financial Durable Power of Attorney: An Unscripted Role
       , 75 Neb. L. Rev. 574 (1996). Among states that address agent duties, the standard of care varies widely and ranges from a due care standard (
       see, e.g.
       , 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 45/2-7 (1992); Ind. Code Ann. § 30-5-6-2 (1994)) to a trustee-type standard (
       <i>
        see, e.g.
       </i>
       , Fla. Stat. Ann. § 709.08(8) (2006); Mo. Ann. Stat. § 404.714 (2001)). Section 114 [this section] clarifies agent duties by articulating minimum mandatory duties (subsection (a) [(1)]) as well as default duties that can be modified or omitted by the principal (subsection (b) [(2)]).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mandatory duties — acting in accordance with the principal’s reasonable expectations, if known, and otherwise in the principal’s best interest; acting in good faith; and acting only within the scope of authority granted — may not be altered in the power of attorney. Establishing the principal’s reasonable expectations as the primary guideline for agent conduct is consistent with a policy preference for “substituted judgment” over “best interest” as the surrogate decision-making standard that better protects an incapacitated person’s self-determination interests.
    See
    Wingspan — The Second National Guardianship Conference,
       Recommendations
       , 31 Stetson L. Rev. 595, 603 (2002).

       Unif. Guardianship & Protective Proc. Act § 314(a) (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act does not require, nor does common practice dictate, that the principal state expectations or objectives in the power of attorney. In fact, one of the advantages of a power of attorney over a trust or guardianship is the flexibility and informality with which an agent may exercise authority and respond to changing circumstances. However, when a principal’s subjective expectations are potentially inconsistent with an objective best interest standard, good practice suggests memorializing those expectations in a written and admissible form as a precaution against later challenges to the agent’s conduct (
    see
    Section 116 [§ 15-12-116]).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a principal’s expectations potentially conflict with a default duty under the Act, then stating the expectations in the power of attorney, or altering the default rule to accommodate the expectations, or both, is advisable. For example, a principal may want to invest in a business owned by a family member who is also the agent in order to improve the economic position of the agent and the agent’s family. Without the principal’s clear expression of this objective, investment by the agent of the principal’s property in the agent’s business may be viewed as breaching the default duty to act loyally for the principal’s benefit (subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)]) or the default duty to avoid conflicts of interest that impair the agent’s ability to act impartially for the principal’s best interest (subsection (b)(2) [(2)(b)]).
    Two default duties in this section protect the principal’s previously-expressed choices. These are the duty to cooperate with the person authorized to make health-care decisions for the principal (subsection (b)(5) [(2)(e)]) and the duty to preserve the principal’s estate plan (subsection (b)(6) [(2)(f)]). However, an agent has a duty to preserve the principal’s estate plan only to the extent the plan is actually known to the agent and only if preservation of the estate plan is consistent with the principal’s best interest. Factors relevant to determining whether preservation of the estate plan is in the principal’s best interest include the value of the principal’s property, the principal’s need for maintenance, minimization of taxes, and eligibility for public benefits. The Act protects an agent from liability for failure to preserve the estate plan if the agent has acted in good faith (subsection (c) [(3)]).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) [(4)] provides that an agent acting with care, competence, and diligence for the best interest of the principal is not liable solely because the agent also benefits from the act or has a conflict of interest. This position is a departure from the traditional common law duty of loyalty which required an agent to act solely for the benefit of the principal.
    See
    Restatement (Second) of Agency § 387 (1958);
       see also
       Unif. Trust Code § 802(a) (2003) (requiring a trustee to administer a trust “solely in the interests” of the beneficiary). Subsection (d) [(4)] is modeled after state statutes which provide that loyalty to the principal can be compatible with an incidental benefit to the agent.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Cal. Prob. Code § 4232(b) (2006); 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 45/2-7 (1992); Ind. Code Ann. § 30-5-9-2 (2005). The Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.01 (2006) also contemplates that loyal service to the principal may be concurrently beneficial to the agent (
       <i>

       </i>
       Reporter’s note a).
       <i>

       </i>
       , 114 Yale L.J. 929, 943 (2005) (arguing that the sole interest test for loyalty should be replaced by the best interest test). The public policy which favors best interest over sole interest as the benchmark for agent loyalty comports with the practical reality that most agents under powers of attorney are family members who have inherent conflicts of interest with the principal arising from joint property ownership or inheritance expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) [(5)] provides additional protection for a principal who has selected an agent with special skills or expertise by requiring that such skills or expertise be considered when evaluating the agent’s conduct. If a principal chooses to appoint a family member or close friend to serve as an agent, but does not intend that agent to serve under a higher standard because of special skills or expertise, the principal should consider including an exoneration provision within the power of attorney (
    see
    comment to Section 115 [§ 15-12-115]).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (f) and (g) [(6) and (7)] state protections for an agent that are similar in scope to those applicable to a trustee. Subsection (f) [(6)] holds an agent harmless for decline in the value of the principal’s property absent a breach of fiduciary duty (
    cf.
    Unif. Trust Code § 1003(b) (2003)). Subsection (g) [(7)] holds an agent harmless for the conduct of a person to whom the agent has delegated authority, or who has been engaged by the agent on the principal’s behalf, provided the agent has exercised care, competence, and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person (
       cf.
       Unif. Trust Code § 807(c) (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (h) [(8)] codifies the agent’s common law duty to account to a principal (
    see
    Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.12 (2006); Restatement (First) of Agency § 382 (1933)). Rather than create an affirmative duty of periodic accounting, subsection (h) [(8)] states that the agent is not required to disclose receipts, disbursements or transactions unless ordered by a court or requested by the principal, a fiduciary acting for the principal, or a governmental agency with authority to protect the welfare of the principal. If the principal is deceased, the principal’s personal representative or successor in interest may request an agent to account. While there is no affirmative duty to account unless ordered by the court or requested by one of the foregoing persons, subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)] does create a default duty to keep records.
    The narrow categories of persons that may request an agent to account are consistent with the premise that a principal with capacity should control to whom the details of financial transactions are disclosed. If a principal becomes incapacitated or dies, then the principal’s fiduciary or personal representative may succeed to that monitoring function. The inclusion of a governmental agency (such as Adult Protective Services) in the list of persons that may request an agent to account is patterned after state legislative trends and is a response to growing national concern about financial abuse of vulnerable persons.

       This section permits a principal to exonerate an agent from liability for breach of fiduciary duty, but prohibits exoneration for a breach committed dishonestly, with improper motive, or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the power of attorney or the best interest of the principal. The mandatory minimum standard of conduct required of an agent is equivalent to the good faith standard applicable to trustees. A trustee’s failure to adhere to that standard cannot be excused by language in the trust instrument.
    See
    Unif. Trust Code § 1008 cmt. (2003) (noting that “a trustee must always act in good faith with regard to the purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries”).
    <i>
     See also
    </i>
    Section 102(4) [§ 15-12-102(d)] (defining good faith for purposes of the Act as “honesty in fact”). Section 115 [this section] provides, as an additional measure of protection for the principal, that an exoneration provision is not binding if it was inserted as the result of abuse of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with the principal. While as a matter of good practice an exoneration provision should be the exception rather than the rule, its inclusion in a power of attorney may be useful in meeting particular objectives of the principal. For example, if the principal is concerned that contentious family members will attack the agent’s conduct in order to gain control of the principal’s assets, an exoneration provision may deter such action or minimize the likelihood of success on the merits.

        The primary purpose of this section is to protect vulnerable or incapacitated principals against financial abuse. Subsection (a) [(1)] sets forth broad categories of persons who have standing to petition the court for construction of the power of attorney or review of the agent’s conduct, including in the list a “person that demonstrates sufficient interest in the principal’s welfare” (subsection (a)(8) [(1)(h)]). Allowing any person with sufficient interest to petition the court is the approach taken by the majority of states that have standing provisions.

        In addition to providing a means for detecting and redressing financial abuse by agents, this section protects the self-determination rights of principals. Subsection (b) [(2)] states that the court must dismiss a petition upon the principal’s motion unless the court finds that the principal lacks the capacity to revoke the agent’s authority or the power of attorney. Contrasted with the breadth of Section 116 [this section] is Section 114(h) [§ 15-12-114(8)] which narrowly limits the persons who can request an agent to account for transactions conducted on the principal’s behalf. The rationale for narrowly restricting who may request an agent to account is the preservation of the principal’s financial privacy.
    See
    Section 114 [§ 15-12-114] Comment. Section 116 [this section] operates as a check-and-balance on the narrow scope of Section 114(h) [§ 15-12-114(8)] and provides what, in many circumstances, may be the only means to detect and stop agent abuse of an incapacitated principal.

       This section provides that an agent’s liability for violating the Act includes not only the amount necessary to restore the principal’s property to what it would have been had the violation not occurred, but also any amounts for attorney’s fees and costs advanced from the principal’s property on the agent’s behalf. This section does not, however, limit the agent’s liability exposure to these amounts. Pursuant to Section 123 [§ 15-12-123], remedies under the Act are not exclusive. If a jurisdiction has enacted separate statutes to deal with financial abuse, an agent may face additional civil or criminal liability.

       Section 118 [this section] provides a default procedure for an agent’s resignation. An agent who no longer wishes to serve should formally resign in order to establish a clear demarcation of the end of the agent’s authority and to minimize gaps in fiduciary responsibility before a successor accepts the office. If the principal still has capacity when the agent wishes to resign, this section requires only that the agent give notice to the principal. If, however, the principal is incapacitated, the agent must, in addition to giving notice to the principal, give notice as set forth in paragraphs (1) or (2).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (1) provides that notice must be given to a fiduciary, if one has been appointed, and to a coagent or successor agent, if any. If the principal does not have an appointed fiduciary and no coagent or successor agent is named in the power of attorney, then the agent may choose among the notice options in paragraph (2). Paragraph (2) permits the resigning agent to give notice to the principal’s caregiver, a person reasonably believed to have sufficient interest in the principal’s welfare, or a governmental agency having authority to protect the welfare of the principal. The choice among these options is intentionally left to the agent’s discretion and is governed by the same standards as apply to other agent conduct.
    See
    Section 114(a) [§ 15-12-114(1)] (requiring the agent to act in accordance with the principal’s reasonable expectations, if known, and otherwise in the principal’s best interest).

        This section protects persons who in good faith accept an acknowledged power of attorney. Section 119 [this section] does not apply to unacknowledged powers of attorney.
    See
    Section 105 [§ 15-12-105] (providing that the signature on a power of attorney is presumed genuine if acknowledged). Subsection (a) [(1)] states that for purposes of this section and Section 120 [§ 15-12-120] “acknowledged” means “purportedly” verified before an individual authorized to take acknowledgments. The purpose of this definition is to protect a person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of attorney without knowledge that it contains a forged signature or a latent defect in the acknowledgment.
    <i>
     See, e.g.
    </i>
    , Cal. Prob. Code § 4303(a)(2) (2006); 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 45/2-8 (2006); Ind. Code Ann.<cite class="id_code">§ 30-5</cite>-8-2 (1994); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 32A-40 (2005). The Act places the risk that a power of attorney is invalid upon the principal rather than the person that accepts the power of attorney. This approach promotes acceptance of powers of attorney, which is essential to their effectiveness as an alternative to guardianship. The national survey conducted by the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trust and Estate Acts (
    <i>
     see
    </i>
    Prefatory Note) found that a majority of respondents had difficulty obtaining acceptance of powers of attorney. Sixty-three percent reported occasional difficulty and seventeen percent reported frequent difficulty. Linda S. Whitton,

        Section 119 [this section] permits a person to rely in good faith on the validity of the power of attorney, the validity of the agent’s authority, and the propriety of the agent’s exercise of authority, unless the person has actual knowledge to the contrary (subsection (c) [(3)]). Although a person is not required to investigate whether a power of attorney is valid or the agent’s exercise of authority proper, subsection (d) [(4)] permits a person to request an agent’s certification of any factual matter (
    see
    Section 302 [§ 15-12-302] for a sample certification form) and an opinion of counsel as to any matter of law. If the power of attorney contains, in whole or part, language other than English, an English translation may also be requested. Further protection is provided in subsection (f) [(6)] for persons that conduct activities through employees. Subsection (f) [(6)] states that for purposes of Sections 119 [this section] and 120 [§ 15-12-120], a person is without actual knowledge of a fact if the employee conducting the transaction is without actual knowledge of the fact.

       As a complement to Section 119 [§ 15-12-119], Section 120 [this section] enumerates the bases for legitimate refusals of a power of attorney as well as sanctions for refusals that violate the Act. Like Section 119 [§ 15-12-119], Section 120 [this section] does not apply to unacknowledged powers of attorney. Enacting jurisdictions are provided a choice between alternative Sections 120 [this section]. Alternatives A and B are identical except that Alternative B applies only to acknowledged statutory form powers of attorney while Alternative A applies to all acknowledged powers of attorney. [Idaho has adopted Alternative A.]
    Subsection (b) [(2)] of Alternative A provides the bases upon which an acknowledged power of attorney may be refused without liability. The last paragraph of subsection (b) [(2)] permits refusal of an otherwise valid acknowledged power of attorney that does not meet any of the other bases for refusal if the person in good faith believes that the principal is subject to abuse by the agent or someone acting in concert with the agent (paragraph (6) [(f)]). A refusal under this paragraph is protected if the person makes, or knows another person has made, a report to the governmental agency authorized to protect the welfare of the principal. Pennsylvania has a similar provision. See 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 5608(a) (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a basis exists in subsection (b) [(2)] for refusing an acknowledged power of attorney, subsection (a) [(1)] requires that, within seven business days after the power of attorney is presented, a person must either accept the power of attorney or request a certification, a translation, or an opinion of counsel pursuant to Section 119 [§ 15-12-119]. If a request under Section 119 [§ 15-12-119] is made, the person must decide to accept or reject the power of attorney no later than five business days after receipt of the requested document (subsection (a)(2) [(1)(b)]). Provided no basis exists for refusing the power of attorney, subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)] prohibits a person from requesting an additional or different form of power of attorney for authority granted in the power of attorney presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [(3)] of Alternative A provides that a person that refuses an acknowledged power of attorney in violation of Section 120 [this section] is subject to a court order mandating acceptance and to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in the action to confirm the validity of the power of attorney or to mandate acceptance. Statutory liability for unreasonable refusal of a power of attorney is based on a growing state legislative trend.

       The Act is supplemented by common law, including the common law of agency, where provisions of the Act do not displace relevant common law principles. The common law of agency is articulated in the Restatement of Agency and includes contemporary and evolving rules of decision developed by the courts in exercise of their power to adapt the law to new situations and changing conditions. The common law also includes the traditional and broad equitable jurisdiction of the court, which this Act in no way restricts.

       This section addresses concerns of representatives from the banking and insurance industries that there may be regulations which govern those entities that conflict with provisions of this Act. Although no specific conflicts were identified during the drafting process, Section 122 [this section] provides that in the event a law applicable to a financial institution or other entity is inconsistent with this Act, the other law will supersede this Act to the extent of the inconsistency. This concern about inconsistency with the requirements of other law is already substantially addressed in Section 120 [§ 15-12-120], which provides, in pertinent part, that a person is not required to accept a power of attorney if, “the person is not otherwise required to engage in a transaction with the principal in the same circumstances,” or “engaging in a transaction with the agent or the principal in the same circumstances would be inconsistent with federal law.”

       The remedies under the Act are not intended to be exclusive with respect to causes of action that may accrue in relation to a power of attorney. The Act applies to many persons, individual and entity (see Section 102(6) [§ 15-12-102(6)] (defining “person” for purposes of the Act)), that may serve as agents or that may be asked to accept a power of attorney. Likewise, the Act applies to many subject areas (
    see
    Article 2) over which principals may delegate authority to agents. Remedies under other laws which govern such persons and subject matters should be considered by aggrieved parties in addition to remedies available under this Act.

      <p>
       Article 2 is based in part on the predecessor Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act, approved in 1988. It provides the default statutory construction for authority granted in a power of attorney. Sections 204 through 217 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-217] describe authority with respect to various subject matters. These descriptions may be incorporated by reference in the optional statutory form (Section 301 [§ 15-12-301]) or in an individually drafted power of attorney. Incorporation is accomplished either by referring to the descriptive term for the subject or by providing a citation to the section in which the authority is described (Section 202 [§ 15-12-202]). A principal may also modify any authority incorporated by reference (Section 202(c) [§ 15-12-202(3)]). Section 203 [§ 15-12-203] supplements Sections 204 through 217 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-217] by providing general terms of construction that apply to all grants of authority under those sections unless otherwise indicated in the power of attorney.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the language in Sections 204 through 216 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-216] of Article 2 comes directly from the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act. The language has been revised where necessary to reflect modern custom and practice. Where significant changes have been made, they are noted in a comment to the relevant section. In general, there are two important differences between the statutory treatment of authority in this Act and in the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act. First, this Act includes a section that provides a default rule for the parameters of gift making authority (Section 217 [§ 15-12-217]). Second, this Act identifies specific acts that may be authorized only by an express grant in the power of attorney (Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)]). Express authorization for the acts listed in Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)] is required because of the risk those acts pose to the principal’s property and estate plan. The purpose of Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)] is to make clear that authority for these acts may not be inferred from a grant of general authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section distinguishes between grants of specific authority that require express language in a power of attorney and grants of general authority. Section 201(a) [(1)] enumerates the acts that require an express grant of specific authority and which may not be inferred from a grant of general authority. This approach follows a growing trend among states to require express specific authority for such actions as making a gift, creating or revoking a trust, and using other non-probate estate planning devices such as survivorship interests and beneficiary designations.
    See, e.g.
    , Cal. Prob. Code § 4264 (2006); Kan. Stat. Ann.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.58.html#t58c06s58-654" target="_blank">§ 58-654</a></cite>(f) (2005); Mo. Ann. Stat. § 404.710 (2001); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 11.94.050 (2006). See also Section 9 of the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, which applies “[t]o the extent a power of attorney expressly grants an agent authority over the content of electronic communications sent or received by the principal . . . .” The rationale for requiring a grant of specific authority to perform the acts enumerated in subsection (a) [(1)] is the risk those acts pose to the principal’s property and estate plan. Although risky, such authority may nevertheless be necessary to effectuate the principal’s property management and estate planning objectives. Ideally, these are matters about which the principal will seek advise before granting authority to an agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act does not contain statutory construction language for any of the acts enumerated in subsection (a) [(1)] other than the making of gifts (see Section 217 [§ 15-12-217]). Because a gift of the principal’s property reduces the principal’s estate, the Act, like a number of state statutes, sets default per-donee limits on gift amounts.
    See, e.g.
    , N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c00s5-1502M" target="_blank">§ 5-1502M</a></cite> (2001); 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 5603(a)(2)(ii) (2005). However, as with any authority incorporated by reference in a power of attorney, the principal may enlarge or restrict the default parameters set by the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to other acts listed in Section 201(a) [(1)], the Act contemplates that the principal will specify any special instructions in the power of attorney to further define or limit the authority granted. For example, if a principal grants authority to create or change rights of survivorship (subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)]) or beneficiary designations (subsection (a)(4) [(1)(d)]) the principal may choose to restrict that authority to specifically identified property interests, accounts, or contracts. Principals should carefully consider not only whether to authorize any of the acts listed in Section 201(a) [(1)], but also whether to limit the scope of such actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [(2)] contains an additional safeguard for the principal. It establishes as a default rule that an agent who is not an ancestor, spouse, or descendant of the principal may not exercise authority to create in the agent or in an individual the agent is legally obligated to support, an interest in the principal’s property. For example, a non-relative agent with gift making authority could not make a gift to the agent or a dependent of the agent without the principal’s express authority in the power of attorney. In contrast, a spouse-agent with express gift-making authority could implement the principal’s expectation that annual family gifts be continued without additional authority in the power of attorney.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding a grant of authority to perform any of the enumerated acts in subsection (a) [(1)], an agent is bound by the mandatory fiduciary duties set forth in Section 114(a) [§ 15-12-114(1)] as well as the default duties that the principal has not modified. For a list of these default rules, see Section 301 [§ 15-12-301] Comment. If the principal’s expectations for the performance of authorized acts potentially conflict with those duties, then clarification of the principal’s expectations, modification of the default duties, or both, may be advisable.
    See
    Section 114 [§ 15-12-114] Comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority for acts and subject matters other than those listed in Section 201(a) [(1)] may be granted either through incorporation by reference (
    see
    Section 202) [§ 15-12-202] or, if the principal wishes to grant comprehensive general authority, by a grant of authority to do all the acts that a principal could do. A broad grant of general authority is interpreted under the Act as including all of the subject matters and authority described in Sections 204 through 216 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-216] (

       This section provides two methods for incorporating into a power of attorney the Act’s statutory construction for authority over various subject matters. A reference in a power of attorney to the descriptive term for a subject in Sections 204 through 217 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-217], or to the section number, incorporates the entire statutory section as if it were set out in full in the power of attorney. Subsection (c) [(3)] provides that a principal may modify any authority incorporated by reference. The optional statutory form power of attorney provided in Section 301 [§ 15-12-301] uses the descriptive terms in Sections 204 through 217 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-217] to incorporate statutory construction for authority granted on the form and provides a “Special Instructions” section where the principal may modify any authority incorporated by reference.

       This section is based on Section 3 of the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act. It describes incidental types of authority that accompany all authority granted to an agent under each of Sections 204 through 217 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-217], unless this incidental authority is modified in the power of attorney. The actions authorized in Section 203 [§ 15-12-203] are of the type often necessary for the exercise or implementation of authority over the subjects described in Sections 204 through 217 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-217].
    See
    Unif. Statutory Form Power of Atty. Act prefatory note (1988). Paragraph (10), which states that an agent is authorized to “do any [other] lawful act with respect to the subject and all property related to the subject,” emphasizes that a grant of general authority is intended to be comprehensive unless otherwise limited by the Act or the power of attorney. Paragraphs (8) and (9) were added to the section to clarify that this comprehensive authority includes authorization to communicate with government employees on behalf of the principal, to access communications intended for the principal, and to communicate on behalf of the principal using all modern means of communication.

       The substance of this section remains unchanged from Section 6 the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act; however, the wording is revised to reflect that “stocks and bonds” is now a defined term in the Act. See Section 102(14) [§ 15-12-102 (14)].

       This section contains a significant change from Section 10 of the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act. The default language in the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act permitted an agent to designate the beneficiary of an insurance contract.
    See
    Unif. Statutory Form Power of Atty. Act § 10(4) (1988). However, under Section 210 [this section] of this Act, an agent does not have authority to “create or change a beneficiary designation” unless that authority is specifically granted to the agent pursuant to Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)]. The authority granted under Paragraph (2) of Section 210 [this section] is more limited, allowing an agent to only “procure new, different, and additional contracts of insurance and annuities for the principal and the principal’s spouse, children, and other dependents.” A principal who grants authority to an agent under Section 210 [this section] should therefore carefully consider whether a specific grant of authority to create or change beneficiary designations is also desirable.

      <p>
       This section, based on Section 13 of the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act, contains three important changes. The first is clarification in subsection (a)(1) [(1)(a)] of who qualifies to benefit from payments for personal and family maintenance. Paragraph (1) [(a)] states that the individuals who may benefit include not only the principal’s children and other individuals legally entitled to be supported by the principal, but also “individuals whom the principal has customarily supported or indicated the intent to support,” “whether living when the power of attorney is executed or later born.” This definition is broad enough to include common recipients of family support such as parents and later-born grandchildren if such support is intended by the principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second important addition to Section 213 [this section] is the inclusion of paragraph (6) [(f)] in subsection (a) [(1)] which qualifies the agent to act as the principal’s “personal representative” for purposes of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) so that the agent can communicate with health care providers in order to pay medical bills.
    See
    45 C.F.R. § 164.502(g)(1)-(2) (2006) (providing that for purposes of disclosing an individual’s protected health information, “a covered entity must . . . treat a personal representative as the individual”). Section 213 [this section] does not, however, empower the agent to make health-care decisions for the principal.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 103 [§ 15-12-103] and comment (discussing exclusion from this Act of powers to make health-care decisions).
      </p>
      <p>
       The third important addition to this section is subsection (b) [(2)] which provides that authority under Section 213 [this section] is neither dependent upon, nor limited by, authority that an agent may or may not have with respect to making gifts. Although payments made for the benefit of persons under Section 213 [this section] may in fact be subject to gift tax treatment, subsection (b) [(2)] clarifies that the authority for personal and family maintenance payments by an agent emanates from this section rather than Section 217 [§ 15-12-217]. This is an important distinction because the Act requires a grant of specific authority under Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)] to authorize gift making, and the default provisions of Section 217 [§ 15-12-217] limit the amounts of those gifts. The authority to make payments under Section 213 [this section] is not constrained by either of these provisions.

       This section, based on Section 15 of the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act, has been substantially updated to reflect changes in the laws governing retirement plans. A significant departure from the Uniform Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act is the deletion of default authority in the agent to waive the right of the principal to be a beneficiary of a joint or survivor annuity (
    see
    Unif. Statutory Form Power of Atty. Act § 15 (1988)). Under this Act, the authority to waive the principal’s right to be a beneficiary of a joint and survivor annuity must be given by a specific grant pursuant to Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)].

       <p>
        This section provides default limitations on an agent’s authority to make a gift of the principal’s property. Authority to make a gift must be made by a specific grant in a power of attorney (
    see
    Section 201(a)(2) [§ 15-12-201(1)(b)];
    <i>
     see also
    </i>
    Section 301 [§ 15-12-301]). The mere granting to an agent of authority to make gifts does not, however, grant an agent unlimited authority. The agent’s authority is subject to this section unless enlarged or further limited by an express modification in the power of attorney. Without modification, the authority of an agent under this section is limited to gifts in an amount per donee not to exceed the annual dollar limits of the federal gift tax exclusion, or twice that amount if the principal and the principal’s spouse consent to make a split gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) [(1)] of this section clarifies the fact that a gift includes not only outright gifts, but also gifts for the benefit of a person. Subsection (a) [(1)] provides examples of gifts made for the benefit of a person, but these examples are not intended to be exclusive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) [(3)] emphasizes that exercise of authority to make a gift, as with exercise of all authority under a power of attorney, must be consistent with the principal’s objectives. If these objectives are not known, then gifts must be consistent with the principal’s best interest based on all relevant factors. Subsection (c) [(3)] provides examples of factors relevant to the principal’s best interest, but these examples are illustrative rather than exclusive.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that a principal’s objectives with respect to the making of gifts may potentially conflict with an agent’s default duties under the Act, the principal should carefully consider stating those objectives in the power of attorney, or altering the default rules to accommodate the objectives, or both.

      <p>
       This power of attorney does not authorize the agent to make health care decisions for you.

       This form provides for designation of one (1) agent. If you wish to name more than one (1) agent, you may name a coagent in the Special Instructions. Coagents are not required to act together unless you include that requirement in the Special Instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your agent is unable or unwilling to act for you, your power of attorney will end unless you have named a successor agent. You may also name a second successor agent.

      <p>
       This power of attorney becomes effective immediately unless you state otherwise in the Special Instructions.

       AGENT’S DUTIES
      </p>
      <p>
       When you accept the authority granted under this power of attorney, a special legal relationship is created between you and the principal. This relationship imposes upon you legal duties that continue until you resign or the power of attorney is terminated or revoked. You must:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t15c12p03s15-12-301-IMPORTANTINFORMATIONFORAGENTol11">

      </p>
      <p>
       (2)      Avoid conflicts that would impair your ability to act in the principal’s best interest;

      <p>
       TERMINATION OF AGENT’S AUTHORITY
      </p>
      <p>
       You must stop acting on behalf of the principal if you learn of any event that terminates this power of attorney or your authority under this power of attorney. Events that terminate a power of attorney or your authority to act under a power of attorney include:
    (1) Death of the principal;
      </p>
      <p>
       (2)      The principal’s revocation of the power of attorney or your authority;

      <p>
       (5)      A legal action is filed with a court to end your marriage to the principal, or for your legal separation, unless the Special Instructions in this power of attorney state that such an action will not terminate your authority.

       <p>
        Article 3 provides a concise, optional statutory form for creating a power of attorney under this Act (Section 301 [§ 15-12-301]). With the proliferation of power of attorney forms in the public domain, the advantage of a statutorily-sanctioned form is the promotion of uniformity in power of attorney practice. In states such as Illinois and New York, where state-sanctioned statutory forms have existed for many years, the statutory form is widely used by both lawyers and lay persons. The familiarity and common understanding achieved with the use of one statutory form also facilitates acceptance of powers of attorney. In the twenty years preceding this Act, the number of states with statutory forms has increased from only a few to eighteen.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the statutory form power of attorney, Article 3 provides an optional form for agent certification of facts pertaining to a power of attorney (Section 302 [§ 15-12-302]). Pursuant to Section 119 [§ 15-12-119], a person may request an agent to certify any factual matter concerning the principal, agent, or power of attorney. The form in Section 302 [§ 15-12-302] is intended to facilitate agent compliance with these requests. The form lists factual matters about which persons commonly request certification (
    e.g.
    , the principal is alive and has not revoked the power of attorney or the agent’s authority), and provides a designated space for certification of additional factual statements. Both the statutory form power of attorney and the agent certification form may be tailored to accommodate individual circumstances and objectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides an optional form for creating a power of attorney. Any power of attorney that substantially complies with the form in Section 301 [this section] constitutes a statutory form power of attorney with the meaning and effect prescribed by the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The form begins with an “Important Information” section that contains instructions for the principal and concludes with an “Important Information for Agent” section that contains general information for the agent about agent duties, events that terminate an agent’s authority, and agent liability. The form is constructed to guide the principal through designation of an agent, optional designation of one or more successor agents, and selection of subject areas and acts with respect to which the principal wishes to grant the agent authority. The form also contains an option for nomination of a conservator or guardian in the event later court-appointment of a fiduciary becomes necessary (
    see
    Section 108 [§ 15-12-108] and Comment).
       </p>
       <p>
        The grant of authority provisions in the form are divided into two sections: “Grant of General Authority,” which corresponds to the subject areas defined in Sections 204 through 216 [§§ 15-12-204 through 15-12-216] of the Act, and “Grant of Specific Authority,” which corresponds to the actions for which Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)] requires an express grant of authority in a power of attorney. Article 2 of the Act provides statutory construction with respect to all of the subject matters in the Grant of General Authority section and for the authority to make a gift listed in the Grant of Specific Authority section. The principal may modify any authority granted in the form by using the “Special Instructions” section of the form. For example, the scope of authority to make a gift is defined by the default provisions of Section 217 [§ 15-12-217] unless the principal expands or narrows that authority in the Special Instructions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cautionary language in the Grant of Specific Authority section alerts the principal to the increased risks associated with a grant of authority that could significantly reduce the principal’s property or alter the principal’s estate plan. The form is constructed to require that the principal initial each action over which the principal grants specific authority. The separate authorization of acts covered by Section 201(a) [§ 15-12-201(1)] is intended to emphasize to the principal the significance of granting such specific authority and to minimize the risk that those actions might be authorized inadvertently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many principals may wish to grant an agent comprehensive authority over their day-to-day affairs. If this is the case, the principal may grant authority over all of the subject areas in the Grant of General Authority section by initialing “All Preceding Subjects.” Otherwise, the principal may authorize fewer than all of the subjects listed in the Grant of General Authority section by initialing only those particular subjects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory form is drafted to follow the Act’s default provisions, but it does not preclude alteration of the default rules or the exercise of other options available under the Act. For example, if not altered by the Special Instructions, the default rules embodied in a statutory form power of attorney include:

     PREFATORY NOTE
    </h4>
    <p>
     The Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act (UGPPA), which was last revised in 1997, is a comprehensive act addressing all aspects of guardianships and protective proceedings for both minors and adults. The Uniform Adult Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Jurisdiction Act (UAGPPJA) has a much narrower scope, dealing only with jurisdiction and related issues in adult proceedings. Drafting of the UAGPPJA began in 2005. The Act had its first reading at the Uniform Law Commission 2006 Annual Meeting, and was approved at the 2007 Annual Meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     States may enact the UAGPPJA either separately or as part of the broader UGPPA or the even broader Uniform Probate Code (UPC), of which the UGPPA forms a part.

    <h5 id="t15c12p04s15-12-403-PREFATORYNOTE-theproblemofmultiplejurisdiction">
     The Problem of Multiple Jurisdiction
    </h5>
    <p>
     Because the United States has 50 plus guardianship systems, problems of determining jurisdiction are frequent. Questions of which state has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or conservator can arise between an American state and another country. But more frequently, problems arise because the individual has contacts with more than one American state.
    </p>
    <p>
     In nearly all American states, a guardian may be appointed by a court in a state in which the individual is domiciled or is physically present. In nearly all American states, a conservator may be appointed by a court in a state in which the individual is domiciled or has property. Contested cases in which courts in more than one state have jurisdiction are becoming more frequent. Sometimes these cases arise because the adult is physically located in a state other than the adult’s domicile. Sometimes the case arises because of uncertainty as to the adult’s domicile, particularly if the adult owns a second home in another state. There is a need for an effective mechanism for resolving multi-jurisdictional disputes. Article [Part] 2 of the UAGPPJA is intended to provide such a mechanism.
    </p>
    <h5 id="t15c12p04s15-12-403-PREFATORYNOTE-theproblemoftransfer">
     The Problem of Transfer
    </h5>
    <p>
     Oftentimes, problems arise even absent a dispute. Even if everyone is agreed that an already existing guardianship or conservatorship should be moved to another state, few states have streamlined procedures for transferring a proceeding to another state or for accepting such a transfer. In most states, all of the procedures for an original appointment must be repeated, a time consuming and expensive prospect. Article [Part] 3 of the UAGPPJA is designed to provide an expedited process for making such transfers, thereby avoiding the need to relitigate incapacity and whether the guardian or conservator appointed in the first state was an appropriate selection.
    </p>
    <h5 id="t15c12p04s15-12-403-PREFATORYNOTE-theproblemofout-of-staterecognition">
     The Problem of Out-of-State Recognition
    </h5>
    <p>
     The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution requires that court orders in one state be honored in another state. But there are exceptions to the full faith and credit doctrine, of which guardianship and protective proceedings is one. Sometimes, guardianship or protective proceedings must be initiated in a second state because of the refusal of financial institutions, care facilities, and the courts to recognize a guardianship or protective order issued in another state. Article [Part] 4 of the UAGPPJA creates a registration procedure. Following registration of the guardianship or protective order in the second state, the guardian may exercise in the second state all powers authorized in the original state’s order of appointment except for powers that cannot be legally exercised in the second state.

     The Objectives and Key Concepts of the Proposed UAGPPJA
    </h5>
    <p>
     Similar problems of jurisdiction existed for many years in the United States in connection with child custody determinations. If one parent lived in one state and the other parent lived in another state, frequently courts in more than one state had jurisdiction to issue custody orders. But the Uniform Law Conference has approved two uniform acts that have effectively minimized the problem of multiple court jurisdiction in child custody matters; the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), approved in 1968, succeeded by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), approved in 1997. The drafters of the UAGPPJA have elected to model Article 2 and portions of Article 1 of their Act after these child custody analogues. However, the UAGPPJA applies only to adult proceedings. The UAGPPJA is limited to adults in part because most jurisdictional issues involving guardianships for minors are subsumed by the UCCJEA. The Objectives and Key Concepts of the Proposed UAGPPJA
    </p>
    <p>
     The UAGPPJA is organized into five articles. Article [Part] 1 contains definitions and provisions designed to facilitate cooperation between courts in different states. Article [Part] 2 is the heart of the Act, specifying which court has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or conservator or issue another type of protective order and contains definitions applicable only to that article. Its principal objective is to assure that an appointment or order is made or issued in only one state except in cases of emergency or in situations where the individual owns property located in multiple states. Article [Part] 3 specifies a procedure for transferring a guardianship or conservatorship proceedings from one state to another state. Article [Part] 4 deals with enforcement of guardianship and protective orders in other states. Article [Part] 5 contains an effective date provision, a place to list provisions of existing law to be repealed or amended, and boilerplate provisions common to all uniform acts.

     <p class="">
    Key Definitions (Section 201 [§ 15-13-201])
    </p>
    <p>
     To determine which court has primary jurisdiction under the UAGPPJA, the key factors are to determine the individual’s “home state” and “significant-connection state.” A “home state” (Section 201(a)(2) [§ 15-13-201(1)(b)]) is the state in which the individual was physically present, including any period of temporary absence, for at least six consecutive months immediately before the filing of a petition for a protective order or appointment of a guardian. If the respondent was not physically present in a single state for the six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition, the home state is the place where the respondent was last physically present for at least six months as long a such presence ended within the six months prior to the filing of the petition. Section 201(a)(2) [§ 15-31-201(1)(b)]. Stated another way, the ability of the home state to appoint a guardian or enter a protective order for an individual continues for up to six months following the individual’s physical relocation to another state.
    </p>
    <p>
     A “significant-connection state,” which is a potentially broader concept, means the state in which the individual has a significant connection other than mere physical presence, and where substantial evidence concerning the individual is available. Section 201(a)(3) [§ 15-13-201(1)(c)]. Factors that may be considered in deciding whether a particular respondent has a significant connection include:
    </p>
    <p>
     •      the location of the respondent’s family and others required to be notified of the guardianship or protective proceeding;
    </p>
    <p>
     •      the length of time the respondent was at any time physically present in the state and the duration of any absences;
    </p>
    <p>
     •      the location of the respondent’s property; and
    </p>
    <p>
     •      the extent to which the respondent has other ties to the state such as voting registration, filing of state or local tax returns, vehicle registration, driver’s license, social relationships, and receipt of services. Section 201(b) [§ 15-13-201(2)].
    A respondent in a guardianship or protective proceeding may have multiple significant-connection states but will have only one home state.

     Section 204 [§ 15-13-204] addresses special cases. Regardless of whether it has jurisdiction under the general principles stated in Section 203 [§ 15-13-203], a court in the state where the respondent is currently physically present has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian in an emergency, and a court in a state where a respondent’s real or tangible personal property is located has jurisdiction to appoint a conservator or issue another type of protective order with respect to that property. In addition, a court not otherwise having jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] has jurisdiction to consider a petition to accept the transfer of an already existing guardianship or conservatorship from another state as provided in Article [Part] 3.

     Transfer to Another State (Article [Part] 3)
    </h5>
    <p>
     <p class="">
    The remainder of Article [Part] 2 elaborates on these core concepts. Section 205 [§ 15-13-205] provides that once a guardian or conservator is appointed or other protective order is issued, the court’s jurisdiction continues until the proceeding is terminated or transferred or the appointment or order expires by its own terms. Section 206 [§ 15-13-206] authorizes a court to decline jurisdiction if it determines that the court of another state is a more appropriate forum, and specifies the factors to be taken into account in making this determination. Section 207 [§ 15-13-207] authorizes a court to decline jurisdiction or fashion another appropriate remedy if jurisdiction was acquired because of unjustifiable conduct. Section 208 [§ 15-13-208] prescribes additional notice requirements if a proceeding is brought in a state other than the respondent’s home state. Section 209 [§ 15-13-209] specifies a procedure for resolving jurisdictional issues if petitions are pending in more than one state. The UAGPPJA also includes provisions regarding communication between courts in different states, requests for assistance made by a court to a court of another state, and the taking of testimony in another state. Sections 104-106 [§§ 15-13-104 to 15-13-106]. Transfer to Another State (Article [Part] 3)
    </p>
    <p>
     Article [Part] 3 specifies a procedure for transferring an already existing guardianship or conservatorship to another state. To make the transfer, court orders are necessary from both the court transferring the case and from the court accepting the case. The transferring court must find that the incapacitated or protected person is physically present in or is reasonably expected to move permanently to the other state, that adequate arrangements have been made for the person or the person’s property in the other state, and that the court is satisfied the case will be accepted by the court in the other state. To assure continuity, the court in the transferring state cannot dismiss the local proceeding until the order from the state accepting the case is filed with the transferring court. To expedite the transfer process, the court in the accepting state must give deference to the transferring court’s finding of incapacity and selection of the guardian or conservator. Much of Article [Part] 3 is based on the pioneering work of the National Probate Court Standards, a 1993 joint project of the National College of Probate Judges and the National Center for State Courts.

     The Problem of Differing Terminology
    </h5>
    <p>
     States differ on terminology for the person appointed by the court to handle the personal and financial affairs of a minor or incapacitated adult. Under the UGPPA and in a majority of American states, a “guardian” is appointed to make decisions regarding the person of an “incapacitated person;” a “conservator” is appointed in a “protective proceeding” to manage the property of a “protected person.” But in many states, only a “guardian” is appointed, either a guardian of the person or guardian of the estate, and in a few states, the terms guardian and conservator are used but with different meanings. The UAGPPJA adopts the terminology used in the UGPPA and in a majority of the states. An enacting state that uses a different term than “guardian” or “conservator” for the person appointed by the court or that defines either of these terms differently than does the UGPPA may, but is not encouraged to, substitute its own term or definition. Use of common terms and definitions by states enacting the Act will facilitate resolution of cases involving multiple jurisdictions.

       The title to the Act succinctly describes the Act’s scope. The Act applies only to court jurisdiction and related topics for adults for whom the appointment of a guardian or conservator or other protective order is being sought or has been issued.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drafting committee elected to limit the Act to adults for two reasons. First, jurisdictional issues concerning guardians for minors are subsumed by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997). Second, while the UCCJEA does not address conservatorship and other issues involving the property of minors, all of the problems and concerns that led the Uniform Law Commission to appoint a drafting committee involved adults.

      <p>
       The definition of “adult” (paragraph (1)) would exclude an emancipated minor. The Act is not designed to supplant the local substantive law on guardianship. States whose guardianship law treats emancipated minors as adults may wish to modify this definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three of the other definitions are standard uniform law terms. These are the definitions of “person” (paragraph (8)), “record” (paragraph (12)), and “state” (paragraph (14)). Two are common procedural terms. The individual for whom a guardianship or protective order is sought is a “respondent” (paragraph (13)). A person who may participate in a guardianship or protective proceeding is referred to as a “party” (paragraph (7)).
      </p>
      <p>
       The remaining definitions refer to standard guardianship terminology used in a majority of states. A “guardian” (paragraph (3)) is appointed in a “guardianship order” (paragraph (4)) which is issued as part of a “guardianship proceeding” (paragraph (5)) and which authorizes the guardian to make decisions regarding the person of an “incapacitated person” (paragraph (6)). A “conservator” (paragraph (2)) is appointed pursuant to a “protective order” (paragraph (10)) which is issued as part of a “protective proceeding” (paragraph (11)) and which authorizes the conservator to manage the property of a “protected person” (paragraph (9)).
    In most states, a protective order may be issued by the court without the appointment of a conservator. For example, under the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act (1997), the court may authorize a so-called single transaction for the security, service, or care meeting the foreseeable needs of the protected person, including the payment, delivery, deposit, or retention of property; sale, mortgage, lease, or other transfer of property; purchase of an annuity; making a contract for life care, deposit contract, or contract for training and education; and the creation of or addition to a suitable trust. UGPPA (1997) Section 412(1). It is for this reason that the Act contains frequent references to the broader category of protective orders. Where the Act is intended to apply only to conservatorships, such as in Article [Part] 3 dealing with transfers of proceedings to other states, the Act refers to conservatorship and not to the broader category of protective proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act does not limit the types of conservatorships or guardianships to which the Act applies. The Act applies whether the conservatorship or guardianship is denominated as plenary, limited, temporary or emergency. The Act, however, would not ordinarily apply to a guardian ad litem, who is ordinarily appointed by the court to represent a person or conduct an investigation in a specified legal proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 102 [§ 15-13-102] is not the sole definitional section in the Act. Section 201 [§ 15-13-201] contains definitions of important terms used only in Article [Part] 2. These are the definitions of “emergency” (Section 201(1) [§ 15-13-201(1)(a)]), “home state” (Section 201(2) [§ 15-13-201(1)(b)]), and “significant-connection state” (Section 201(3) [§ 15-13-201(1)(c)]).

       This section addresses application of the Act to guardianship and protective orders issued in other countries. A foreign order is not enforceable pursuant to the registration procedures of Article [Part] 4, but a court in this country may otherwise apply this Act to a foreign proceeding as if the foreign country were an American state. Consequently, a court may conclude that the court in the foreign country has jurisdiction because it constitutes the respondent’s “home state” or “significant-connection state” and may therefore decline to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that the court of the foreign country has a higher priority under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203]. Or the court may treat the foreign country as if it were a state of the United States for purposes of applying the transfer provisions of Article [Part] 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section addresses similar issues to but differs in result from Section 105 [§ 15-13-105] of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997). Under the UCCJEA, the United States court must honor a custody order issued by the court of a foreign country if the order was issued under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional standards of the UCCJEA. Only if the child custody law violates fundamental principles of human rights is enforcement excused. Because guardianship regimes vary so greatly around the world, particularly in civil law countries, it was concluded that under this Act a more flexible approach was needed. Under this Act, a court may but is not required to recognize the foreign order.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a guardianship or protective order of a foreign country cannot be enforced pursuant to the registration procedures of Article [Part] 4 does not preclude enforcement by the court under some other provision or rule of law.

      <p>
       This section emphasizes the importance of communications among courts with an interest in a particular matter. Most commonly, this would include communication between courts of different states to resolve an issue of which court has jurisdiction to proceed under Article [Part] 2. It would also include communication between courts of different states to facilitate the transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship to a different state under Article [Part] 3. Communication can occur in a variety of ways, including by electronic means. This section does not prescribe the use of any particular means of communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may authorize the parties to participate in the communication. But the Act does not mandate participation or require that the court give the parties notice of any communication. Communication between courts is often difficult to schedule and participation by the parties may be impractical. Phone calls or electronic communications often have to be made after-hours or whenever the schedules of judges allow. When issuing a jurisdictional or transfer order, the court should set forth the extent to which a communication with another court may have been a factor in the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section includes brackets around the language relating to whether a record must be made of any communication with the court of the other state. As indicated by the Legislative Note to this section, the language is bracketed because of a concern in some states that a legislative enactment directing when a court must make a record in a judicial proceeding may violate the doctrine on separation of powers. The language is not bracketed because the drafters concluded that the making of a record is not important. Rather, if concerns about separation of powers leads to the deletion of the bracketed language, the enacting state is encouraged to achieve the objectives of the bracketed language by promulgating a comparable provision by judicial rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not prescribe the extent of the record that the court must make, leaving that issue to the court. A record might include notes or transcripts of a court reporter who listened to a conference call between the courts, an electronic recording of a telephone call, a memorandum summarizing a conversation, and email communications. No record need be made of relatively inconsequential matters such as scheduling, calendars, and court records.
    Section 110 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997) addresses similar issues as this section but is more detailed. As is the case with several other provisions of this Act, the drafters of this Act concluded that the more varied circumstances of adult guardianship and protective proceedings suggested a need for greater flexibility.

       Subsection (a) [(1)] of this section is similar to Section 112(a) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997), although modified to address issues of concern in adult guardianship and protective proceedings and with the addition of subsection (a)(7) [(1)(g)], which addresses the release of health information protected under HIPAA. Subsection (b) [(2)], which clarifies that a court has jurisdiction to respond to requests for assistance from courts in other states even though it might otherwise not have jurisdiction over the proceeding, is not found in although probably implicit in the UCCJEA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Court cooperation is essential to the success of this Act. This section is designed to facilitate such court cooperation. It provides mechanisms for courts to cooperate with each other in order to decide cases in an efficient manner without causing undue expense to the parties. Courts may request assistance from courts of other states and may assist courts of other states. Typically, such assistance will be requested to resolve a jurisdictional issue arising under Article [Part] 2 or an issue concerning a transfer proceeding under Article [Part] 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not address assessment of costs and expenses, leaving that issue to local law. Should a court have acquired jurisdiction because of a party’s unjustifiable conduct, Section 207(b) [§ 15-13-207(2)] authorizes the court to assess against the party all costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees.

       This section is similar to Section 111 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997). That section was in turn derived from Section 316 of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (1992) and the much earlier and now otherwise obsolete Uniform Interstate and International Procedure Act (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is designed to fill the vacuum that often exists in cases involving an adult with interstate contacts when much of the essential information about the individual is located in another state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) [(1)] empowers the court to initiate the gathering of out-of-state evidence, including depositions, written interrogatories and other discovery devices. The authority granted to the court in no way precludes the gathering of out-of-state evidence by a party, including the taking of depositions out-of-state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (b) [(2)] and (c) [(3)] clarify that modern modes of communication are permissible for the taking of depositions and receipt of documents into evidence. A state that has adequate exceptions to its best evidence rule to permit the introduction of evidence transmitted by facsimile or in electronic form should delete subsection (c) [(3)], which has been placed in brackets for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is consistent with and complementary to the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (2007), which specifies the procedure for taking depositions in other states.

     The jurisdictional rules in Article [Part] 2 will determine which state’s courts may appoint a guardian or conservator or issue another type of protective order. Section 201 [§ 15-13-201] contains definitions of “emergency,” “home state,” and “significant-connection state,” terms used only in Article [Part] 2 that are key to understanding the jurisdictional rules under the Act. Section 202 [§ 15-13-202] provides that Article [Part] 2 is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for a court of the enacting state to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order for an adult. Consequently, Article [Part] 2 is applicable even if all of the respondent’s significant contacts are in-state. Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] is the principal provision governing jurisdiction, creating a three-level priority; the home state, followed by a significant-connection state, followed by other jurisdictions. But there are circumstances under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] where a significant-connection state may have jurisdiction even if the respondent also has a home state, or a state that is neither a home or significant-connection state may be able to assume jurisdiction even though the particular respondent has both a home state and one or more significant-connection states. One of these situations is if a state declines to exercise jurisdiction under Section 206 [§ 15-13-206] because a court of that state concludes that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. Another is Section 207 [§ 15-13-207], which authorizes a court to decline jurisdiction or fashion another appropriate remedy if jurisdiction was acquired because of unjustifiable conduct. Section 205 [§ 15-13-205] provides that once an appointment is made or order issued, the court’s jurisdiction continues until the proceeding is terminated or the appointment or order expires by its own terms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 204 [§ 15-13-204] addresses special cases. Regardless of whether it has jurisdiction under the general principles stated in Section 203 [§ 15-13-203], a court in the state where the individual is currently physically present has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian in an emergency, and a court in a state where an individual’s real or tangible personal property is located has jurisdiction to appoint a conservator or issue another type of protective order with respect to that property. In addition, a court not otherwise having jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] has jurisdiction to consider a petition to accept the transfer of an already existing guardianship or conservatorship from another state as provided in Article [Part] 3.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remainder of Article [Part] 2 addresses procedural issues. Section 208 [§ 15-13-208] prescribes additional notice requirements if a proceeding is brought in a state other than the respondent’s home state. Section 209 [§ 15-13-209] specifies a procedure for resolving jurisdictional issues if petitions are pending in more than one state.

       The terms “emergency,” “home state,” and “significant-connection state” are defined in this section and not in Section 102 [§ 15-13-102] because they are used only in Article [Part] 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “emergency” (subsection (a)(1) [(1)(a)]) is taken from the emergency guardianship provision of the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act (1997), Section 312.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 204 [§ 15-13-204] of this Act, a court has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian in an emergency for a period of up to 90 days even though it does not otherwise have jurisdiction. However, the emergency appointment is subject to the direction of the court in the respondent’s home state. Pursuant to Section 204(b) [§ 15-13-204(2)], the emergency proceeding must be dismissed at the request of the court in the respondent’s home state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointing a guardian in an emergency should be an unusual event. Although most states have emergency guardianship statutes, not all states do, and in those states that do have such statutes, there is great variation on whether and how an emergency is defined. To provide some uniformity on when a court acquires emergency jurisdiction, the drafters of this Act concluded that adding a definition of emergency was essential. The definition does not preclude an enacting jurisdiction from appointing a guardian under an emergency guardianship statute with a different or broader test of emergency if the court otherwise has jurisdiction to make an appointment under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203].
    Pursuant to Section 203 [§ 15-13-203], a court in the respondent’s home state has primary jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order. A court in a significant-connection state has jurisdiction if the respondent does not have a home state and in other circumstances specified in Section 203 [§ 15-13-203]. The definitions of “home state” and “significant-connection state” are therefore important to an understanding of the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “home state” (subsection (a)(2) [(1)(b)]) is derived from but differs in a couple of respects from the definition of the same term in Section 102 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997). First, unlike the definition in the UCCJEA, the definition in this Act clarifies that actual physical presence is necessary. The UCCJEA definition instead focuses on where the child has “lived” for the prior six months. Basing the test on where someone has “lived” may imply that the term “home state” is similar to the concept of domicile. Domicile, in an adult guardianship context, is a vague concept that can easily lead to claims of jurisdiction by courts in more than one state. Second, under the UCCJEA, home state jurisdiction continues for six months following physical removal from the state and the state has ceased to be the actual home. Under this Act, the six-month tail is incorporated directly into the definition of home state. The place where the respondent was last physically present for six months continues as the home state for six months following physical removal from the state. This modification of the UCCJEA definition eliminates the need to refer to the six-month tail each time home state jurisdiction is mentioned in the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “significant-connection state” (subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)]) is similar to Section 201(a)(2) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997). However, subsection (b) [(2)] of this Section adds a list of factors relevant to adult guardianship and protective proceedings to aid the court in deciding whether a particular place is a significant-connection state. Under Section 301(e)(1) [§ 15-13-301(5)(a)], the significant connection factors listed in the definition are to be taken into account in determining whether a conservatorship may be transferred to another state

       Similar to Section 201(b) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997), which provides that the UCCJEA is the exclusive basis for determining jurisdiction to issue a child custody order, this section provides that this article is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for determining jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order for an adult. An enacting jurisdiction will therefore need to repeal any existing provisions addressing jurisdiction in guardianship and protective proceedings cases. A Legislative Note to Section 503 [§ 15-13-503] provides guidance on which provisions need to be repealed or amended. The drafters of this Act concluded that limiting the Act to “interstate” cases was unworkable. Such cases are hard to define, but even if they could be defined, overlaying this Act onto a state’s existing jurisdictional rules would leave too many gaps and inconsistencies. In addition, if the particular case is truly local, the local court would likely have jurisdiction under both this Act as well as under prior law.

       Similar to the Uniform Child Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997), this Act creates a three-level priority for determining which state has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order; the home state (defined in Section 201(a)(2) [§ 15-13-201(1)(b)]), followed by a significant-connection state (defined in Section 201(a)(3) [§ 15-13-201(1)(c)]), followed by other jurisdictions. The principal objective of this section is to eliminate the possibility of dual appointments or orders except for the special circumstances specified in Section 204 [§ 15-13-204].
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section is the principal provision for determining whether a particular court has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order, it is not the only provision. As indicated in the cross-reference in Section 203(4) [§ 15-13-203(4)], a court that does not otherwise have jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] may have jurisdiction under the special circumstances specified in Section 204 [§ 15-13-204].
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 203(1) [§ 15-13-203(1)], the home state has primary jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or conservator or issue another type of protective order. This jurisdiction terminates if the state ceases to be the home state, if a court of the home state declines to exercise jurisdiction under Section 206 [§ 15-13-206] on the basis that another state is a more appropriate forum, or, as provided in Section 205 [§ 15-13-205], a court of another state has appointed a guardian or issued a protective order consistent with this Act. The standards by which a home state that has enacted the Act may decline jurisdiction on the basis that another state is a more appropriate forum are specified in Section 206 [§ 15-13-206]. Should the home state not have enacted the Act, Section 203(1) [§ 15-13-203(1)] does not require that the declination meet the standards of Section 206 [§ 15-13-206].
    Once a petition is filed in a court of the respondent’s home state, that state does not cease to be the respondent’s home state upon the passage of time even though it may be many months before an appointment is made or order issued and during that period the respondent is physically located. Only upon dismissal of the petition can the court cease to be the home state due to the passage of time. Under the definition of “home state,” the six-month physical presence requirement is fulfilled or not on the date the petition is filed. See Section 201(a)(2) [§ 15-13-201(1)(b)].
      </p>
      <p>
       A significant-connection state has jurisdiction under two possible bases; Section 203(2)(A) [§ 15-13-203(2)(a)] and Section 203(2)(B) [§ 15-13-203(2)(b)]. Under Section 203(2)(A) [§ 15-13-203(2)(a)], a significant-connection state has jurisdiction if the individual does not have a home state or if the home state has declined jurisdiction on the basis that the significant-connection state is a more appropriate forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 203(2)(B) [§ 15-13-203(2)(b)] is designed to facilitate consideration of cases where jurisdiction is not in dispute. Section 203(2)(B) [§ 15-13-203(2)(b)] allows a court in a significant-connection state to exercise jurisdiction even though the respondent has a home state and the home state has not declined jurisdiction. The significant-connection state may assume jurisdiction under these circumstances, however, only in situations where the parties are not in disagreement concerning which court should hear the case. Jurisdiction may not be exercised by a significant-connection state under Section 203(2)(B) [§ 15-12-203(2)(b)] if (1) a petition has already been filed and is still pending in the home state or other significant-connection state; or (2) prior to making the appointment or issuing the order, a petition is filed in the respondent’s home state or an objection to the court’s jurisdiction is filed by a person required to be notified of the proceeding. Additionally, the court in the significant-connection state must conclude that it is an appropriate forum applying the factors listed in Section 206 [§ 15-13-206].
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing comparable to Section 203(2)(B) in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997). Under Section 201 [§ 15-13-201] of the UCCJEA a court in a significant-connection state acquires jurisdiction only if the child does not have a home state or the court of that state has declined jurisdiction. The drafters of this Act concluded that cases involving adults differed sufficiently from child custody matters that a different rule is appropriate for adult proceedings in situations where jurisdiction is uncontested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 203(3) [§ 15-13-203(3)], a court in a state that is neither the home state or a significant-connection state has jurisdiction if the home state and all significant-connection states have declined jurisdiction or the respondent does not have a home state or significant-connection state. The state must have some connection with the proceeding, however. As Section 203(3) [§ 15-13-203(3)] clarifies, jurisdiction in the state must be consistent with the state and United States constitutions.

       This section lists the special circumstances where a court without jurisdiction under the general rule of Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] has jurisdiction for limited purposes. The three purposes are (1) the appointment of a guardian in an emergency for a term not exceeding 90 days for a respondent who is physically located in the state (subsection (a)(1) [(1)(a)]); (2) the issuance of a protective order for a respondent who owns an interest in real or tangible personal property located in the state (subsection (a)(2) [(1)(b)]); and (3) the grant of jurisdiction to consider a petition requesting the transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding from another state (subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)]). If the court has jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203], reference to Section 204 [§ 15-13-204] is unnecessary. The general jurisdiction granted under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] includes within it all of the special circumstances specified in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an emergency arises, action must often be taken on the spot in the place where the respondent happens to be physically located at the time. This place may not necessarily be located in the respondent’s home state or even a significant-connection state. Subsection (a)(1) [(1)(a)] assures that the court where the respondent happens to be physically located at the time has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian in an emergency but only for a limited period of 90 days. The time limit is placed in brackets to signal that enacting states may substitute the time period under their existing emergency guardianship procedures. As provided in subsection (b) [(2)], the emergency jurisdiction is also subject to the authority of the court in the respondent’s home state to request that the emergency proceeding be dismissed. The theory here is that the emergency appointment in the temporary location should not be converted into a de facto permanent appointment through repeated temporary appointments.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Emergency” is specifically defined in Section 201(a)(1) [§ 15-13-201(1)(a)]. Because of the great variation among the states on how an emergency is defined and its important role in conferring jurisdiction, the drafters of this Act concluded that adding a uniform definition of emergency was essential. The definition does not preclude an enacting jurisdiction from appointing a guardian under an emergency guardianship statute with a different or broader test of emergency if the court otherwise has jurisdiction to make an appointment under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203].
    Subsection (a)(2) [(1)(b)] grants a court jurisdiction to issue a protective order with respect to real and tangible personal property located in the state even though the court does not otherwise have jurisdiction. Such orders are most commonly issued when a conservator has been appointed but the protected person owns real property located in another state. The drafters specifically rejected using a general reference to any property located in the state because of the tendency of some courts to issue protective orders with respect to intangible personal property such as a bank account where the technical situs of the asset may have little relationship to the protected person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)] is closely related to and is necessary for the effectiveness of Article [Part] 3, which addresses transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship to another state. A “Catch-22” arises frequently in such cases. The court in the transferring state will not allow the incapacitated or protected person to move and will not terminate the case until the court in the transferee state has accepted the matter. But the court in the transferee state will not accept the case until the incapacitated or protected person has physically moved and presumably become a resident of the transferee state. Subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)], which grants the court in the transferee state limited jurisdiction to consider a petition requesting transfer of a proceeding form another state, is intended to unlock the stalemate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not included in this section but a provision also conferring special jurisdiction on the court is Section 105(b) [§ 15-13-105(2)], which grants the court jurisdiction to respond to a request for assistance from a court of another state.

       While this Act relies heavily on the Uniform Child Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997) for many basic concepts, the identity is not absolute. Section 202 [§ 15-13-202] of the UCCJEA specifies a variety of circumstances whereby a court can lose jurisdiction based on loss of physical presence by the child and others, loss of a significant connection, or unavailability of substantial evidence. Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] of the UCCJEA addresses the jurisdiction of the court to modify a custody determination made in another state. Nothing comparable to either UCCJEA section is found in this Act. Under this Act, a guardianship or protective order may be modified only upon request to the court that made the appointment or issued the order, which retains exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the proceeding. Unlike child custody matters, guardianships and protective proceedings are ordinarily subject to continuing court supervision. Allowing the court’s jurisdiction to terminate other than by its own order would open the possibility of competing guardianship or conservatorship appointments in different states for the same person at the same time, the problem under current law that enactment of this Act is designed to avoid. Should the incapacitated or protected person and others with an interest in the proceeding relocate to a different state, the appropriate remedy is to seek transfer of the proceeding to the other state as provided in Article [Part] 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exclusive and continuing jurisdiction conferred by this section only applies to guardianship orders made and protective orders issued under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203]. Orders made under the special jurisdiction conferred by Section 204 [§ 15-13-204] are not exclusive. And as provided in Section 204(b) [§ 15-13-204(2)], the jurisdiction of a court in a state other than the home state to appoint a guardian in an emergency is subject to the right of a court in the home state to request that the proceeding be dismissed and any appointment terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article [Part] 3 authorizes a guardian or conservator to petition to transfer the proceeding to another state. Upon the conclusion of the transfer, the court in the accepting state will appoint the guardian or conservator as guardian or conservator in the accepting state and the court in the transferring estate will terminate the local proceeding, whereupon the jurisdiction of the transferring court terminates and the court in the accepting state acquires exclusive and continuing jurisdiction as provided in Section 205 [§ 15-13-205].

       This section authorizes a court otherwise having jurisdiction to decline jurisdiction on the basis that a court in another state is in a better position to make a guardianship or protective order determination. The effect of a declination of jurisdiction under this section is to rearrange the priorities specified in Section 203 [§ 15-13-203]. A court of the home state may decline in favor of a court of a significant-connection or other state and a court in a significant-connection state may decline in favor of a court in another significant-connection or other state. The court declining jurisdiction may either dismiss or stay the proceeding. The court may also impose any condition the court considers just and proper, including the condition that a petition for the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a protective order be filed promptly in another state.

       This section is similar to Section 207 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997) except that the factors in Section 206(c) [§ 15-13-206(3)] of this Act have been adapted to address issues most commonly encountered in adult guardianship and protective proceedings as opposed to child custody determinations.
    Under Section 203(2)(B) [§ 15-13-203(2)(b)], the factors specified in subsection (c) [(3)] of this section are to be employed in determining whether a court of a significant-connection state may assume jurisdiction when a petition has not been filed in the respondent’s home state or in another significant-connection state. Under Section 207(a)(3)(B) [§ 15-13-207(1)(c)(ii)], the court is to consider these factors in deciding whether it will retain jurisdiction when unjustifiable conduct has occurred.

       This section is similar to the Section 208 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997). Like the UCCJEA, this Act does not attempt to define “unjustifiable conduct,” concluding that this issue is best left to the courts. However, a common example could include the unauthorized removal of an adult to another state, with that state acquiring emergency jurisdiction under Section 204 [§ 15-13-204] immediately upon the move and home state jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] six months following the move if a petition for a guardianship or protective order is not filed during the interim in the soon-to-be former home state. Although child custody cases frequently raise different issues than do adult guardianship matters, the element of unauthorized removal is encountered in both types of proceedings. For the caselaw on unjustifiable conduct under the predecessor Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (1968), see David Carl Minneman, Parties’ Misconduct as Grounds for Declining Jurisdiction Under § 8 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), 16 A.L.R. 5th 650 (1993).
    Subsection (a) [(1)] gives the court authority to fashion an appropriate remedy when it has acquired jurisdiction because of unjustifiable conduct. The court may decline to exercise jurisdiction; exercise jurisdiction for the limited purpose of fashioning an appropriate remedy to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the respondent or the protection of the respondent’s property or prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct; or continue to exercise jurisdiction after considering several specified factors. Under subsection (a) [(1)], the unjustifiable conduct need not have been committed by a party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [(2)] authorizes a court to assess costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, against a party whose unjustifiable conduct caused the court to acquire jurisdiction. Subsection (b) [(2)] applies only if the unjustifiable conduct was committed by a party and allows for costs and expenses to be assessed only against that party. Similar to Section 208 [§ 15-13-208] of the UCCJEA, the court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses of any kind against this state or a governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the state unless authorized by other law.

       While this Act tries not to interfere with a state’s underlying substantive law on guardianship and protective proceedings, the issue of notice is fundamental. Under this section, when a proceeding is brought other than in the respondent’s home state, the petitioner must give notice in the method provided under local law not only to those entitled to notice under local law but also to the persons required to be notified were the proceeding brought in the respondent’s home state. Frequently, the respective lists of persons to be notified will be the same. But where the lists are different, notice under this section will assure that someone with a right to assert that the home state has a primary right to jurisdiction will have the opportunity to make that assertion.

       Similar to Section 206 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (1997), this section addresses the issue of which court has the right to proceed when proceedings for the same respondent are brought in more than one state. The provisions of this section, however, have been tailored to the needs of adult guardianship and protective proceedings and the particular jurisdictional provisions of this Act. Emergency guardianship appointments and protective proceedings with respect to property in other states (Sections 204(a)(1) and (a)(2) [§§ 15-13-204(1)(a) and (1)(b)]) are excluded from this section because the need for dual appointments is frequent in these cases; for example, a petition will be brought in the respondent’s home state but emergency action will be necessary in the place where the respondent is temporarily located, or a petition for the appointment of a conservator will be brought in the respondent’s home state but real estate located in some other state needs to be brought under management.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Act only one court in which a petition is pending will have jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203]. If a petition is brought in the respondent’s home state, that court has jurisdiction over that of any significant-connection or other state. If the petition is first brought in a significant-connection state, that jurisdiction will be lost if a petition is later brought in the home state prior to an appointment or issuance of an order in the significant-connection state. Jurisdiction will also be lost in the significant-connection state if the respondent has a home state and an objection is filed in the significant-connection state that jurisdiction is properly in the home state. If petitions are brought in two significant-connection states, the first state has a right to proceed over that of the second state, and if a petition is brought in any other state, any claim to jurisdiction of that state is subordinate to that of the home state and all significant-connection states.
    Under this section, if the court has jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203], it has the right to proceed unless a court of another state acquires jurisdiction prior to the first court making an appointment or issuing a protective order. If the court does not have jurisdiction under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203], it must defer to the court with jurisdiction unless that court determines that the court in this state is the more appropriate forum and it thereby acquires jurisdiction. While the rules are straightforward, factual issues can arise as to which state is the home state or significant-connection state. Consequently, while under Section 203 [§ 15-13-203] there will almost always be a court having jurisdiction to proceed, reliance on the communication, court cooperation, and evidence gathering provisions of Sections 104 through 106 [§§ 15-13-104 through 15-13-106] will sometimes be necessary to determine which court that might be.

     Part 3
     Transfer of Guardianship or Conservatorship to Another State
    </h2>

    <p>
     While this article consists of two separate sections, they are part of one integrated procedure. Article [Part] 3 authorizes a guardian or conservator to petition the court to transfer the guardianship or conservatorship proceeding to a court of another state. Such a transfer is often appropriate when the incapacitated or protected person has moved or has been placed in a facility in another state, making it impossible for the original court to adequately monitor the proceeding. Article [Part] 3 authorizes a transfer of a guardianship, a conservatorship, or both. There is no requirement that both categories of proceeding be administered in the same state.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 301 [§ 15-13-301] addresses procedures in the transferring state. Section 302 [§ 15-13-302] addresses procedures in the accepting state.
    </p>
    <p>
     A transfer begins with the filing of a petition by the guardian or conservator as provided in Section 301(a) [§ 15-13-301(1)]. Notice of this petition must be given to the persons who would be entitled to notice were the petition a petition for an original appointment. Section 301(b) [§ 15-13-301(2)]. A hearing on the petition is required only if requested or on the court’s own motion. Section 301(c) [§ 15-13-301(3)]. Assuming the court in the transferring state is satisfied that the grounds for transfer stated in Section 301(d) [§ 15-13-301(4)] (guardianship) or 301(e) [§ 15-13-301(5)] (conservatorship) have been met, one of which is that the court is satisfied that the court in the other state will accept the case, the court must issue a provisional order approving the transfer. The transferring court will not issue a final order dismissing the case until, as provided in Section 301(f) [§ 15-13-301(6)], it receives a copy of the provisional order from the accepting court accepting the transferred proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Following issuance of the provisional order by the transferring court, a petition must be filed in the accepting court as provided in Section 302(a) [§ 15-13-302(1)]. Notice of that petition must be given to those who would be entitled to notice of an original petition for appointment in both the transferring state and in the accepting state. Section 302(b) [§ 15-13-302(2)]. A hearing must be held only if requested or on the court’s own motion. Section 302(c) [§ 15-13-302(3)]. The court must issue a provisional order accepting the case unless it is established that the transfer would be contrary to the incapacitated or protected person’s interests or the guardian or conservator is ineligible for appointment in the accepting state. Section 302(d) [§ 15-13-302(4)]. The term “interests” as opposed to “best interests” was chosen because of the strong autonomy values in modern guardianship law. Should the court decline the transfer petition, it may consider a separately brought petition for the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a protective order only if the court has a basis for jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 204 [§§ 15-13-203 or 15-13-204] other than by reason of the provisional order of transfer. Section 302(h) [§ 15-13-302(8)].
    </p>
    <p>
     The final steps are largely ministerial. Pursuant to Section 301(f) [§ 15-13-301(6)], the provisional order from the accepting court must be filed in the transferring court. The transferring court will then issue a final order terminating the proceeding, subject to local requirements such as filing of a final report or account and the release of any bond. Pursuant to Section 302(e) [§ 15-13-302(5)], the final order terminating the proceeding in the transferring court must then be filed in the accepting court, which will then convert its provisional order accepting the case into a final order appointing the petitioning guardian or conservator as guardian or conservator in the accepting state.
    Because guardianship and conservatorship law and practice will likely differ between the two states, the court in the accepting state must within 90 days after issuance of a final order determine whether the guardianship or conservatorship needs to be modified to conform to the law of the accepting state. Section 302(f) [§ 15-13-302(6)]. The number “90”is placed in brackets to encourage states to coordinate this time limit with the time limits for other required filings such as guardianship or conservatorship plans. This initial period in the accepting state is also an appropriate time to change the guardian or conservator if there is a more appropriate person to act as guardian or conservator in the accepting state. The drafters specifically did not try to design the procedures in Article [Part] 3 for the difficult problems that can arise in connection with a transfer when the guardian or conservator is ineligible to act in the second state, a circumstance that can occur when a financial institution is acting as conservator or a government agency is acting as guardian. Rather, the procedures in Article [Part] 3 are designed for the typical case where the guardian or conservator is legally eligible to act in the second state. Should that particular guardian or conservator not be the best person to act in the accepting state, a change of guardian or conservator can be initiated once the transfer has been secured.
    </p>
    <p>
     The transfer procedure in this article responds to numerous problems that have arisen in connection with attempted transfers under the existing law of most states. Sometimes a court will dismiss a case on the assumption a proceeding will be brought in another state, but such proceeding is never filed. Sometimes a court will refuse to dismiss a case until the court in the other state accepts the matter, but the court in the other state refuses to consider the petition until the already existing guardianship or conservatorship has been terminated. Oftentimes the court will conclude that it is without jurisdiction to make an appointment until the respondent is physically present in the state, a problem which Section 204(a)(3) [§ 15-13-204(1)(c)] addresses by granting a court special jurisdiction to consider a petition to accept a proceeding from another state. But the most serious problem is the need to prove the case in the second state from scratch, including proving the respondent’s incapacity and the choice of guardian or conservator. Article [Part] 3 eliminates this problem. Section 302(g) [§ 15-13-302(7)] requires that the court accepting the case recognize a guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state, including the determination of the incapacitated or protected person’s incapacity and the appointment of the guardian or conservator, if otherwise eligible to act in the accepting state.

     Registration and Recognition of Orders from Other States

    <p>
     Article [Part] 4 is designed to facilitate the enforcement of guardianship and protective orders in other states. This article does not make distinctions among the types of orders that can be enforced. This article is applicable whether the guardianship or conservatorship is full or limited. While some states have expedited procedures for sales of real estate by conservators appointed in other states, few states have enacted statutes dealing with enforcement of guardianship orders, such as when a care facility questions the authority of a guardian appointed in another state. Sometimes, these sorts of refusals necessitate that the proceeding be transferred to the other state or that an entirely new petition be filed, problems that could often be avoided if guardianship and protective orders were entitled to recognition in other states.
    </p>
    <p>
     Article [Part] 4 provides for such recognition. The key concept is registration. Section 401 [§ 15-13-401] provides for registration of guardianship orders, and Section 402 [§ 15-13-402] for registration of protective orders. Following registration of the order in the appropriate county of the other state, and after giving notice to the appointing court of the intent to register the order in the other state, Section 403 [§ 15-13-403] authorizes the guardian or conservator to thereafter exercise all powers authorized in the order of appointment except as prohibited under the laws of the registering state.
    </p>
    <p>
     The drafters of the Act concluded that the registration of certified copies provides sufficient protection and that it was not necessary to mandate the filing of authenticated copies.

       This Act applies retroactively to guardianships and conservatorships in existence on the effective date. The guardian or conservator appointed prior to the effective date of the Act may petition to transfer the proceeding to another state under Article [Part] 3 and register and enforce the order in other states pursuant to Article [Part] 4. The jurisdictional provisions of Article [Part] 2 also apply to proceedings begun on or after the effective date. What the Act does not do is change the jurisdictional rules midstream for petitions filed prior to the effective date for which an appointment has not been made or order issued as of the effective date. Jurisdiction in such cases is governed by prior law. Nor does the Act affect the validity of already existing appointments even though the court might not have had jurisdiction had this Act been in effect at the time the appointment was made.

       PREFATORY NOTE
      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of the Revised Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (Revised UFADAA) is twofold. First, it gives fiduciaries the legal authority to manage digital assets and electronic communications in the same way they manage tangible assets and financial accounts, to the extent possible. Second, it gives custodians of digital assets and electronic communications legal authority to deal with the fiduciaries of their users, while respecting the user’s reasonable expectation of privacy for personal communications. The general goal of the act is to facilitate fiduciary access and custodian disclosure while respecting the privacy and intent of the user. It adheres to the traditional approach of trusts and estates law, which respects the intent of an account holder and promotes the fiduciary’s ability to administer the account holder’s property in accord with legally-binding fiduciary duties. The act removes barriers to a fiduciary’s access to electronic records and property and leaves unaffected other law, such as fiduciary, probate, trust, banking, investment securities, agency, and privacy law. Existing law prohibits any fiduciary from violating fiduciary responsibilities by divulging or publicizing any information the fiduciary obtains while carrying out his or her fiduciary duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revised UFADAA addresses four different types of fiduciaries: personal representatives of decedents’ estates, conservators for protected persons, agents acting pursuant to a power of attorney, and trustees. It distinguishes the authority of fiduciaries, which exercise authority subject to this act only on behalf of the user, from any other efforts to access the digital assets. Family members or friends may seek such access, but, unless they are fiduciaries, their efforts are subject to other laws and are not covered by this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Digital assets are electronic records in which individuals have a right or interest. As the number of digital assets held by the average person increases, questions surrounding the disposition of these assets upon the individual’s death or incapacity are becoming more common. These assets, ranging from online gaming items to photos, to digital music, to client lists, can have real economic or sentimental value. Yet few laws exist on the rights of fiduciaries over digital assets. Holders of digital assets may not consider the fate of their online presences once they are no longer able to manage their assets, and may not expressly provide for the disposition of their digital assets or electronic communications in the event of their death or incapacity. Even when they do, their instructions may come into conflict with custodians’ terms-of-service agreements. Some Internet service providers have explicit policies on what will happen when an individual dies, while others do not, and even where these policies are included in the terms-of-service agreement, consumers may not be fully aware of the implications of these provisions in the event of death or incapacity or how courts might resolve a conflict between such policies and a will, trust instrument, or power of attorney.
    The situation regarding fiduciaries’ access to digital assets is less than clear, and is subject to federal and state privacy and computer “hacking” laws as well as state probate law. A minority of states has enacted legislation on fiduciary access to digital assets, and numerous other states have considered, or are considering, legislation. Existing legislation differs with respect to the types of digital assets covered, the rights of the fiduciary, the category of fiduciary included, and whether the principal’s death or incapacity is covered. A uniform approach among states will provide certainty and predictability for courts, users of Internet services, fiduciaries, and Internet service providers. Revised UFADAA gives states precise, comprehensive, and easily accessible guidance on questions concerning fiduciaries’ ability to access the electronic records of a decedent, protected person, principal, or a trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to the general scope of the act, the act’s coverage is inherently limited by the definition of “digital assets.” The act applies only to electronic records in which an individual has a property right or interest, which do not include the underlying asset or liability unless it is itself an electronic record.
      </p>
      <p>
       The act is divided into 21 sections. Section 2 contains definitions of terms used throughout the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3 governs applicability, clarifying the scope of the act and the fiduciaries who have access to digital assets under Revised UFADAA, and carves out an exception for digital assets of an employer used by an employee during the ordinary course of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 4 provides ways for users to direct the disposition or deletion of their digital assets at their death or incapacity, and establishes a priority system in case of conflicting instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 5 establishes that the terms-of-service governing an online account apply to fiduciaries as well as to users, and clarify that a fiduciary cannot take any action that the user could not have legally taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6 gives the custodians of digital assets a choice for disclosing those assets to fiduciaries. A custodian may, but need not, comply with a request for access by allowing the fiduciary to reset the password and access the user’s account. In many cases that will be the simplest method of compliance. However, a custodian may also comply without giving access to a user’s account by simply giving a copy of all the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary. That method may be preferred for a social media account when a fiduciary has no need for full access and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 7-14 establish the rights of personal representatives, conservators, agents acting pursuant to a power of attorney, and trustees. Each of the fiduciaries is subject to different rules for the content of communications protected under federal privacy laws and for other types of digital assets. Generally, a fiduciary will have access to a catalogue of the user’s communications, but not the content, unless the user consented to the disclosure of the content.
    Section 15 contains general provisions relating to the rights and responsibilities of the fiduciary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 16 addresses compliance by custodians and grants immunity for any acts taken in order to comply with a fiduciary’s request under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 17-21 address miscellaneous topics, including retroactivity, the effective date of the act, and similar issues.

       Many of the definitions are based on those in the Uniform Probate Code: agent (UPC Section 1-201(1)), conservator (UPC Section 5-102(1)), court (UPC Section 1-201(8)), electronic (UPC Section 5B-102(3)), fiduciary (UPC Section 1-201(15)), person (UPC Section 5B-101(6)), personal representative (UPC Section 1-201(35)), power of attorney (UPC Section 5B-102(7)), principal (UPC Section 5B-102(9)), protected person (UPC Section 5-102(8)), record (UPC Section 1-201(41)), and will (UPC Section 1-201(57)). The definition of “information” is based on that in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Section 2, subsection (11). Many of the other definitions are either drawn from federal law, as discussed below, or are new for this act.

       The definition of “account” is broadly worded to encompass any contractual arrangement subject to a terms-of-service agreement, but limited for the purpose of this act by the requirement that the custodian carry, maintain, process, receive, or store a digital asset of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “digital asset” expressly excludes underlying assets such as funds held in an online bank account. Because records may exist in both electronic and non-electronic formats, this definition clarifies the scope of the act and the limitation on the type of records to which it applies. The term includes types of electronic records currently in existence and yet to be invented. It includes any type of electronically-stored information, such as: 1) information stored on a user’s computer and other digital devices; 2) content uploaded onto websites; and 3) rights in digital property. It also includes records that are either the catalogue or the content of an electronic communication. See 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(a)(2); James D. Lamm, Christina L. Kunz, Damien A. Riehl and Peter John Rademacher, The Digital Death Conundrum: How Federal and State Laws Prevent Fiduciaries from Managing Digital Property, 68 U. Miami L. Rev. 385, 388 (2014) (available at:
    http://goo.gl/T9jX1d
    ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “catalogue of electronic communications” is designed to cover log-type information about an electronic communication such as the email addresses of the sender and the recipient, and the date and time the communication was sent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “content of an electronic communication” is adapted from 18 U.S.C. Section 2510(8), which provides that content: “when used with respect to any wire, oral, or electronic communication, includes any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.” The definition is designed to cover only content subject to the coverage of Section 2702 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), 18 U.S.C. Section 2510 et seq.; it does not include content not subject to ECPA. Consequently, the “content of an electronic communication”, as used later throughout Revised UFADAA, refers only to information in the body of an electronic message that is not readily accessible to the public; if the information were readily accessible to the public, it would not be subject to the privacy protections of federal law under ECPA. See S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 36 (1986). Example: X uses a Twitter account to send a message. If the tweet is sent only to other people who have been granted access to X’s tweets, then it meets Revised UFADAA’s definition of “content of an electronic communication.” But, if the tweet is completely public with no access restrictions, then it does not meet the act’s definition of “content of an electronic communication.” ECPA does not apply to private e-mail service providers, such as employers and educational institutions. See 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(a)(2); James D. Lamm, Christina L. Kunz, Damien A. Riehl and Peter John Rademacher, The Digital Death Conundrum: How Federal and State Laws Prevent Fiduciaries from Managing Digital Property, 68 U. Miami L. Rev. 385, 404 (2014) (available at:

    ).

      <p>
       A “user” is a person that has an account with a custodian, and includes a deceased individual that entered into the agreement while alive. A fiduciary can be a user when the fiduciary opens the account.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “carries” is drawn from federal law, 47 U.S.C. Section 1001(8).
      </p>
      <p>
       A “custodian” includes any entity that provides or stores electronic data for a user.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiduciary’s access to a record defined as a “digital asset” does not mean the fiduciary owns the asset or may engage in transactions with the asset. Consider, for example, a fiduciary’s legal rights with respect to funds in a bank account or securities held with a broker or other custodian, regardless of whether the bank, broker, or custodian has a brick-and-mortar presence. This act affects electronic records concerning the bank account or securities, but does not affect the authority to engage in transfers of title or other commercial transactions in the funds or securities, even though such transfers or other transactions might occur electronically. Revised UFADAA only deals with the right of the fiduciary to access all relevant electronic communications and digital assets accessible through the online account. An entity may not refuse to provide access to online records any more than the entity can refuse to provide the fiduciary with access to hard copy records.
      </p>
      <p>
       An “electronic communication” is a particular type of digital asset subject to the privacy protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. It includes email, text messages, instant messages, and any other electronic communication between private parties. The definition of “electronic communication” is that set out in 18 U.S.C. Section 2510(12): “electronic communication” means any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, but does not include—
    (A) any wire or oral communication;
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) any communication made through a tone-only paging device;
      </p>
      <p>
       (C) any communication from a tracking device (as defined in section 3117 of this title); or
      </p>
      <p>
       (D) electronic funds transfer information stored by a financial institution in a communications system used for the electronic storage and transfer of funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “electronic-communication service” is drawn from 18 U.S.C. Section 2510(15): “any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications.” The definition of “remote-computing service” is adapted from 18 U.S.C. Section 2711(2): “the provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system.” The definition refers to 18 U.S.C. Section 2510(14), which defines an electronic communications system as: “any wire, radio, electromagnetic, photooptical or photoelectronic facilities for the transmission of wire or electronic communications, and any computer facilities or related electronic equipment for the electronic storage of such communications.”
      </p>
      <p>
       A “fiduciary” under this act occupies a status recognized by state law, and a fiduciary’s powers under this act are subject to the relevant limits established by other state laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       An “online tool” is a mechanism by which a user names an individual to manage the user’s digital assets after the occurrence of a future event, such as the user’s death or incapacity. The named individual is referred to as the “designated recipient” in the act to differentiate the person from a fiduciary. A designated recipient may perform many of the same tasks as a fiduciary, but is not held to the same legal standard of conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “record” includes information available on both tangible and electronic media. Revised UFADAA applies only to electronic records.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “terms-of-service agreement” definition relies on the definition of “agreement” found in UCC Section 1-201(b)(3) (“the bargain of the parties in fact, as found in their language or inferred from other circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade”). It refers to any agreement that controls the relationship between a user and a custodian, even though it might be called a terms-of-use agreement, a click-wrap agreement, a click-through license, or a similar term. State and federal law determine capacity to enter into a binding terms-of-service agreement.

       This act does not change the substantive rules of other laws, such as agency, banking, conservatorship, contract, copyright, criminal, fiduciary, privacy, probate, property, security, trust, or other applicable law except to vest fiduciaries with authority, according to the provisions of this act, to access or copy digital assets of a decedent, protected person, principal, settlor, or trustee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(2) covers the situations in which a decedent dies intestate, so it falls outside of subsection (a)(1), as well as the situations in which a state’s procedures for small estates are used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) states that custodians are subject to the act if the custodian’s user was a resident of the enacting state. This includes out-of-state custodians, who must respond to requests for access in the same way that out-of-state banks or credit card companies must respond to requests from a fiduciary requesting access to a customer’s account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) clarifies that the act does not apply to a fiduciary’s access to an employer’s internal email system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 1 — Fiduciary access to an employee e-mail account. D dies, employed by Company Y. Company Y has an internal e-mail communication system, available only to Y’s employees, and used by them in the ordinary course of Y’s business. D’s personal representative, R, believes that D used Company Y’s e-mail system to effectuate some financial transactions that R cannot find through other means. R requests access from Company Y to the e-mails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Company Y is not a custodian subject to the act. Under Section 2(8), a custodian must carry, maintain or store a user’s digital assets. A user, under Section 2(26) must have an account, and an account, in turn, is defined under Section 2(1) as a contractual arrangement subject to a terms-of-service agreement. Company Y, like most employers, did not enter into a terms-of-service agreement with D, so Y is not a custodian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 2 — Employee of electronic-communication service provider. D dies, employed by Company Y. Company Y is an electronic-communication service provider. Company Y has an internal e-mail communication system, available only to Y’s employees and used by them in the ordinary course of Y’s business. D used the internal Company Y system. When not at work, D also used an electronic-communication service system that Company Y provides to the public. D’s personal representative, R, believes that D used Company Y’s internal e-mail system as well as Company Y’s electronic-communication system available to the public to effectuate some financial transactions. R seeks access to both communication systems
    As is true in Example 1, Company Y is not a custodian subject to the act for purposes of the internal email system. The situation is different with respect to R’s access to Company Y’s system that is available to the public. Assuming that Company Y can disclose the communications under federal law and R meets the other requirements of this act, Company Y must disclose them to R.

       This section addresses the relationship of online tools, other records documenting the user’s intent, and terms-of-service agreements. In some instances, there may be a conflict between the directions provided by a user in an online tool that limits access by other parties to the user’s digital assets, and the user’s estate planning or other personal documents that purport to authorize access for specified persons in identified situations. The act attempts to balance these interests by establishing a three-tier priority system for determining the user’s intent with respect to any digital asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) gives top priority to a user’s wishes as expressed using an online tool. If a custodian of digital assets allows the user to provide directions for handling those digital assets in case of the user’s death or incapacity, and the user does so, that provides the clearest possible indication of the user’s intent and is specifically limited to those particular digital assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the user does not give direction using an online tool, but makes provisions in an estate plan for the disposition of digital assets, subsection (b) gives legal effect to the user’s directions. The fiduciary charged with managing the user’s digital assets must provide a copy of the relevant document to the custodian when requesting access. See Sections 7 through 14.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the user provides no other direction, the terms-of-service governing the account will apply. If the terms-of-service do not address fiduciary access to digital assets, the default rules provided in this act will apply.

       This section clarifies that, to the extent that a custodian gives a fiduciary access to an account pursuant to Section 6, the account’s terms-of-service agreement applies equally to the original user and to a fiduciary acting for the original user. A fiduciary is subject to the same terms and conditions of the user’s agreement with the custodian. This section does not require a custodian to permit a fiduciary to assume a user’s terms-of-service agreement if the custodian can otherwise comply with Section 6.

       This section governs a custodian’s response to a request for disclosure of a user’s digital assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) gives the custodian of digital assets a choice of methods for disclosing digital assets to an authorized fiduciary. Each custodian has a different business model and may prefer one method over another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) allows a custodian to assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosure. This is intended to be analogous to the charge any business may assess for administrative tasks outside the ordinary course of its business to comply with a court order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) states that any digital asset deleted by the user need not be disclosed, even if recoverable by the custodian. Deletion is assumed to be a good indication that the user did not intend for a fiduciary to have access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) addresses requests that are unduly burdensome because they require segregation of digital assets. For example, a fiduciary’s request for disclosure of “any email pertaining to financial matters” would require a custodian to sort through the full list of emails and cull any irrelevant messages before disclosure. If a custodian receives an unduly burdensome request of this sort, it may decline to disclose the digital assets, and either the fiduciary or custodian may seek guidance from a court.

       The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) distinguishes between the permissible disclosure of the “content” of an electronic communication, covered in 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b), and of “a record or other information pertaining to a” subscriber or customer, covered in 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(c); see Matthew J. Tokson, The Content/Envelope Distinction in Internet Law, 50 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 2105 (2009). Section 7 concerns disclosure of content; Section 8 covers disclosure of non-content and other digital assets of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
       Content-based material can, in turn, be divided into two types of communications: those received by the user and those sent. Federal law, 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b) permits a custodian to divulge the contents of a communication “(1) to an addressee or intended recipient of such communication or an agent of such addressee or intended recipient” or “(3) with the lawful consent of the originator or an addressee or intended recipient of such communication, or the subscriber in the case of remote computing service.”
    Consequently, when the user is the “addressee or intended recipient,” material can be disclosed either to that individual or to an agent for that person, 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b)(1), and it can also be disclosed to third parties with the “lawful consent” of the addressee or intended recipient. 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b)(3). Material for which the user is the “originator” (or the “subscriber” to a remote computing service) can be disclosed to third parties only with the user’s “lawful consent.” 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b)(3). (Note that, when the user is the addressee or intended recipient, material can be disclosed under either (b)(1) or (b)(3), but that when the user is the originator, lawful consent is required under (b)(3).) See the Comments concerning the definition of “content” after Section 2. By contrast to content-based material, non-content material can be disclosed either with the lawful consent of the user or to any person (other than a governmental entity) even without lawful consent. This information includes material about any communication sent, such as the addressee, sender, date/time, and other subscriber data, which this act defines as the “catalogue of electronic communications.” (Further discussion of this issue and examples are set out in the Comments to Section 15, infra.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, Section 7 gives the personal representative access to digital assets if the user consented to disclosure or if a court orders disclosure. To obtain access, the personal representative must provide the documentation specified by Section 7. First, the personal representative must give the custodian a written request for disclosure, a copy of the death certificate, a document establishing the authority of the personal representative, and, in the absence of an online tool, a record evidencing the user’s consent to disclosure. When requesting disclosure, the fiduciary must write or email the custodian. The form of the request is limited, and does not, for example, include video, Tweet, instant message or other forms of communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, if the custodian requests, then the personal representative can be required to establish that the requested information is necessary for estate administration and the account is attributable to the decedent. Different custodians may have different procedures. Thus a custodian may request that the personal representative obtain a court order, and such an order must include findings that: 1) the user had a specific account with the custodian, 2) that disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user would not violate the SCA or other law, 3) unless the user provided direction using an online tool, that the user consented to disclosure of the content of electronic communications, or 4) that disclosure of the content of electronic communications of a user is reasonably necessary for administration of the estate.

        An agent has access to the content of electronic communications only when the power of attorney explicitly grants access. Section 10 concerns disclosure of other digital assets of the principal.
       </p>
       <p>
        When a power of attorney contains the consent of the principal, ECPA does not prevent the agent from exercising authority over the content of an electronic communication. See the Comments to Section 7. There should be no question that an explicit delegation of authority in a power of attorney constitutes authorization from the user to access digital assets and provides “lawful consent” to allow disclosure of the content of an electronic communication from an electronic-communication service or a remote-computing service pursuant to applicable law. Both authorization and lawful consent are important because 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 deals with intentional access without authorization and 18 U.S.C. Section 2702 allows a service provider to disclose with lawful consent. Federal courts have not yet interpreted how ECPA affects a fiduciary’s efforts to access the content of an electronic communication. E.g., In re Facebook, Inc., 923 F. Supp. 2d 1204 (N.D. Cal. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        When requesting access, the agent must write or email the custodian (see the comments in Section 7). The agent must also give the custodian an original or copy of the power of attorney expressly granting the agent authority over the contents of electronic communications of the principal to the agent and a certification by the agent, under penalty of perjury, that the power of attorney is in effect. In addition, if requested by the custodian, the agent must provide a unique subscriber or account identifier assigned by the custodian to identify the principal’s account or other evidence linking the account to the principal.

       Section 11 provides that trustees who are original users can access all digital assets held in the trust. There should be no question that a trustee who is the original user will have full access to all digital assets. This includes the content of electronic communications, as access to content is presumed with respect to assets for which the trustee is the initial user. A trustee may have title to digital assets when the trustee opens an account as trustee; under those circumstances, the trustee can access the content of each digital asset that is in an account for which the trustee is the original user, not necessarily each digital asset held in the trust.

        For accounts that are transferred into a trust by the settlor or in another manner, a trustee is not the original user of the account, and the trustee’s authority is qualified. Thus, Section 12, governing disclosure of content of electronic communications from those accounts, requires consent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 12 addresses situations involving an inter vivos transfer of a digital asset into a trust, a transfer into a testamentary trust, or a transfer via a pourover will or other governing instrument of a digital asset into a trust. In those situations, a trustee becomes a successor user when the settlor transfers a digital asset into the trust. There should be no question that the trustee with legal title to the digital asset was authorized by the settlor to access the digital assets so transferred, including both the catalogue and content of an electronic communication, and this provides “lawful consent” to allow disclosure of the content of an electronic communication from an electronic-communication service or a remote-computing service pursuant to applicable law. See the Comments concerning the definitions of the “content of an electronic communication” after Section 2. Nonetheless, Sections 12 and 13 distinguish between the catalogue and content of an electronic communication in case there are any questions about whether the form in which property transferred into a trust is held constitutes lawful consent. Both authorization and lawful consent are important because 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 deals with intentional access without authorization and because 18 U.S.C. Section 2702 allows a service provider to disclose with lawful consent.
    The underlying trust documents and default trust law will supply the allocation of responsibilities between and among trustees. When requesting access, the trustee must write or email the custodian (see comments to Section 7). The trustee must also give the custodian an original or copy of the trust that includes consent to disclosure of the content of electronic communications to the trustee and a certification by the trustee, under penalty of perjury, that the trust exists and that the trustee is a currently acting trustee of the trust. Also, if requested by the custodian, the trustee must provide a unique subscriber or account identifier assigned by the custodian to identify the trust’s account, or some evidence linking the account to the trust.

      <p>
       When a conservator is appointed to represent a protected person’s interests, the protected person may still retain some right to privacy in their personal communications. Therefore, Section 14 does not permit conservators to request disclosure of a protected person’s electronic communications on the basis of the conservatorship order alone. To access a protected person’s digital assets and a catalogue of electronic communications, a conservator must be specifically authorized by the court to do so. This requirement for express judicial authority over digital assets does not limit the fiduciary’s authority over the underlying assets, such as funds held in a bank account. The meaning of the term “hearing” will vary from state to state according to state law and procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
       State law will establish the criteria for when a court will grant power to the conservator. For example, UPC Section 5-411(c) requires the court to consider the decision the protected person would have made as well as a list of other factors. Existing state law may also set out the requisite standards for a conservator’s actions. The conservator must exercise authority in the interests of the protected person. When requesting access to digital assets in which the protected person has a right or interest, the conservator must write or email the custodian (see comments to Section 7).
      </p>
      <p>
       The conservator must also give the custodian a certified copy of the court order that gives the conservator authority over the protected person’s digital assets. Also, if requested by the custodian, the conservator must provide a unique subscriber or account identifier assigned by the custodian to identify the protected person’s account, or some evidence linking the account to the protected person. The custodian is required to disclose the digital assets so requested.
    Under subsection (c), a conservator with general authority to manage the assets of the protected person may request suspension or termination of the protected person’s account, for good cause

      </h5>
      <p>
       The original version of UFADAA incorporated fiduciary duties by reference to “other law.” This proved to be confusing and led to enactment difficulty. Section 15 specifies the nature, extent and limitation of the fiduciary’s authority over digital assets. Subsection (a) expressly imposes all fiduciary duties to the management of digital assets, including the duties of care, loyalty and confidentiality. Subsection (b) specifies that a fiduciary’s authority over digital assets is subject to the terms-of-service agreement, except to the extent the terms-of-service agreement provision is overridden by an action taken pursuant to Section 4, and it reinforces the applicability of copyright and fiduciary duties. Finally, subsection 15(b) prohibits a fiduciary’s authority being used to impersonate a user. Subsection 15(c) permits the fiduciary to access all digital assets not in an account or subject to a terms-of-service agreement. Subsection 15(d) further specifies that the fiduciary is an authorized user under any applicable law on unauthorized computer access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection 15(g) gives the fiduciary the option of requesting that an account be terminated, if termination would not violate a fiduciary duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       This issue concerning the parameters of the fiduciary’s authority potentially arises in two situations: 1) the fiduciary obtains access to a password or the like directly from the user, as would be true in various circumstances such as for the trustee of an inter vivos trust or someone who has stored passwords in a written or electronic list and those passwords are then transmitted to the fiduciary; and 2) the fiduciary obtains access pursuant to this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section clarifies that the fiduciary has the same authority as the user if the user were the one exercising the authority (note that, where the user has died, this means that the fiduciary has the same access as the user had immediately before death). This means that the fiduciary’s authority to access the digital asset is the same as the user except where, pursuant to Section 4, the user has explicitly opted out of fiduciary access. In exercising its responsibilities, the fiduciary is subject to the duties and obligations established pursuant to state fiduciary law, and is liable for breach of those duties. Note that even if the digital asset were illegally obtained by the user, the fiduciary would still need access in order to handle that asset appropriately. There may, for example, be tax consequences that the fiduciary would be obligated to report.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this section does not require a custodian to permit a fiduciary to assume a user’s terms-of-service agreement if the custodian can otherwise comply with Section 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       In exercising its responsibilities, the fiduciary is subject to the same limitations as the user more generally. For example, a fiduciary cannot delete an account if this would be fraudulent. Similarly, if the user could challenge provisions in a terms-of-service agreement, then the fiduciary is also able to do so. See Ajemian v. Yahoo!, Inc., 987 N.E.2d 604 (Mass. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) is designed to establish that the fiduciary is authorized to obtain or access digital assets in accordance with other applicable laws. The language mirrors that used in Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), also known as the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq. (2006); see, e.g., Orin S. Kerr, A User’s Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a Legislator’s Guide to Amending It, 72 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1208 (2004). The subsection clarifies that state law treats the fiduciary as “authorized” under state laws criminalizing unauthorized access.
      </p>
      <p>
       State laws vary in their coverage but typically prohibit unauthorized computer access. By defining the fiduciary as an authorized user in subsection (d), the fiduciary has authorization under applicable law to access the digital assets under state computer trespass laws.
    Federal courts may look to these provisions to guide their interpretations of ECPA and the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, but fiduciaries should understand that federal courts may not view such provisions as dispositive in determining whether access to a user’s account violated federal criminal law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) clarifies that the fiduciary is authorized to access digital assets stored on tangible personal property of the decedent, protected person, principal, or settlor, such as laptops, computers, smartphones or storage media, exempting fiduciaries from application for purposes of state or federal laws on unauthorized computer access. For criminal law purposes, this clarifies that the fiduciary is authorized to access all of the user’s digital assets, whether held locally or remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 1 — Access to digital assets by personal representative. D dies with a will that is silent with respect to digital assets. D has a bank account for which D received only electronic statements, D has stored photos in a cloud-based Internet account, and D has an e-mail account with a company that provides electronic-communication services to the public. The personal representative of D’s estate needs access to the electronic bank account statements, the photo account, and e-mails.
      </p>
      <p>
       The personal representative of D’s estate has the authority to access D’s electronic banking statements and D’s photo account, which both fall under the act’s definition of a “digital asset.” This means that, if these accounts are password-protected or otherwise unavailable to the personal representative, then the bank and the photo account service must give access to the personal representative when the request is made in accordance with Section 8. If the terms-of-service agreement permits D to transfer the accounts electronically, then the personal representative of D’s estate can use that procedure for transfer as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The personal representative of D’s estate is also able to request that the e-mail account service provider grant access to e-mails sent or received by D; ECPA permits the service provider to release the catalogue to the personal representative. The service provider also must provide the personal representative access to the content of an electronic communication sent or received by D if the user has consented and the fiduciary submitted the information required under Section 7. The bank may release the catalogue of electronic communications or content of an electronic communication for which it is the originator or the addressee because the bank is not subject to the ECPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 2 — Access to digital assets by agent. X creates a power of attorney designating A as X’s agent. The power of attorney expressly grants A authority over X’s digital assets, including the content of an electronic communication. X has a bank account for which X receives only electronic statements, X has stored photos in a cloud-based Internet account, and X has a game character and in-game property associated with an online game. X also has an e-mail account with a company that provides electronic-communication services to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       A has the authority to access X’s electronic bank statements, the photo account, the game character and in-game property associated with the online game, all of which fall under the act’s definition of a “digital asset.” This means that, if these accounts are password-protected or otherwise unavailable to A as X’s agent, then the bank, the photo account service provider, and the online game service provider must give access to A when the request is made in accordance with Section 10. If the terms-of-service agreement permits X to transfer the accounts electronically, then A as X’s agent can use that procedure for transfer as well.
    As X’s agent, A is also able to request that the e-mail account service provider grant access to e-mails sent or received by X; ECPA permits the service provider to release the catalogue. The service provider also must provide A access to the content of an electronic communication sent or received by X if the fiduciary provides the information required under Section 9. The bank may release the catalogue of electronic communications or content of an electronic communication for which it is the originator or the addressee because the bank is not subject to the ECPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 3 — Access to digital assets by trustee. T is the trustee of a trust established by S. As trustee of the trust, T opens a bank account for which T receives only electronic statements. S transfers into the trust to T as trustee (in compliance with a terms-of-service agreement) a game character and in-game property associated with an online game and a cloud-based Internet account in which S has stored photos. S also transfers to T as trustee (in compliance with the terms-of-service agreement) an e-mail account with a company that provides electronic-communication services to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       T is an original user with respect to the bank account that T opened, and T has the ability to access the electronic banking statements under Section 11. T, as successor user to S, may under Section 13 access the game character and in-game property associated with the online game and the photo account, which both fall under the act’s definition of a “digital asset.” This means that, if these accounts are password-protected or otherwise unavailable to T as trustee, then the bank, the photo account service provider, and the online game service provider must give access to T when the request is made in accordance with the act. If the terms-of-service agreement permits the user to transfer the accounts electronically, then T as trustee can use that procedure for transfer as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       T as successor user of the e-mail account for which S was previously the user is also able to request that the e-mail account service provider grant access to e-mails sent or received by S; and ECPA permits the service provider to release the catalogue. The service provider also must provide T access to the content of an electronic communication sent or received by S if the fiduciary provides the information required under Section 12. The bank may release the catalogue of electronic communications or content of an electronic communication for which it is the originator or the addressee because the bank is not subject to the ECPA.

       <p>
        This section establishes that custodians are protected from liability when they act in accordance with the procedures of this act and in good faith. The types of actions covered include disclosure as well as transfer of copies. The critical issue in conferring immunity is the source of the liability. Direct liability is not subject to immunity; indirect liability is subject to immunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Direct liability could only arise from noncompliance with a judicial order issued under sections 7 to 15. Upon determination of a right of access under those sections, a court may issue an order to grant access under section 16. Section 16(b) requires that an order directing compliance contain a finding that compliance is not in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2702. Noncompliance with that order would give rise to liability for contempt. There is no immunity from this liability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indirect liability could arise from granting a right of access under this act. Access to a digital asset might invade the privacy or the harm the reputation of the decedent, protected person, principal, or settlor, it might harm the family or business of the decedent, protected person, principal, or settlor, and it might harm other persons. The grantor of access to the digital asset is immune from liability arising out of any of these circumstances if the grantor acted in good faith to comply with this act. If there is a judicial order under section 16, compliance with the order establishes good faith. Absent a judicial order under section 16, good faith must be established by the grantor’s assessment of the requirements of this act.
    Further, Section 16 (e) allows the custodian to verify that the account belongs to the person represented by the fiduciary.

    <p>
     Statutes in all Canadian and United States jurisdictions permit individuals to delegate substitute decision-making authority. The majority of these statutes, however, do not have portability provisions to recognize the validity of a substitute decision-making document created in another jurisdiction, nor do many have provisions to protect good faith reliance on a substitute decision-making document created within the jurisdiction. Lack of recognition and acceptance of a substitute decision-making document defeats the purpose of a substitute decision-making plan. Once an individual has lost capacity, rejection of a substitute decision-making document often results in guardianship, which burdens judicial resources and undermines the individual’s self-determination interests. The Uniform Recognition of Substitute Decision-Making Documents Act (the “Act”) is a joint endeavor of the Uniform Law Commission and the Uniform Law Conference of Canada (the “ULCC”), undertaken to promote the portability and usefulness of substitute decision-making documents. The ULCC version of the Act closely tracks the Act’s substantive provisions with variations as needed to reflect differences in style and terminology. The ULCC version of the Act was approved at the Annual Meeting of the ULCC in August 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Act, the term substitute decision-making document is intended to be an omnibus designation for a document created by an individual to delegate authority over the individual’s property, health care, or personal care to a substitute decision maker. Jurisdictions use different nomenclature for a substitute decision-making document. Common terms include power of attorney, proxy, and representation agreement. In some jurisdictions, delegated authority over property, health care, and personal care may be granted in one document. More commonly, separate delegations are made with respect to property decisions and those affecting health care and personal care. The Act does not apply to documents that merely provide advance directions for future decisions such as living will declarations and do-not-resuscitate orders. The critical distinction for purposes of this Act is that the document must contain a delegation of authority to a specific decision maker. The Act applies to all substitute decision-making documents, including pre-existing documents, whether created in the enacting jurisdiction or under the law of another jurisdiction.
    The Act embodies a three-part approach to portability modeled after the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006) (the “UPOAA”). First, similar to Section 106 of the UPOAA, Section 3 of the Act recognizes the validity of substitute decision-making documents created under the law of another jurisdiction. The term “jurisdiction” is intended to be read in its broadest sense to include any country or governmental subdivision that permits individuals to delegate substitute decision-making authority. Second, like Section 107 of the UPOAA, Section 4 of the Act preserves the meaning and effect of a substitute decision-making document as defined by the law under which it was created. Third, Sections 5 and 6 of the Act protect good faith acceptance or rejection of a substitute decision-making document without regard to whether the document was created under the law of another jurisdiction or the law of the enacting jurisdiction. Under Section 6(c), refusals in violation of the Act are subject to a court order mandating acceptance and to liability for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Sections 119 and 120 of the UPOAA contain similar provisions. The remedies under this Act are not exclusive and do not abrogate any other right or remedy in the adopting jurisdiction. The Act is designed to complement existing statutes that do not adequately address portability and recognition of substitute decision-making documents.

       The definitions in Section 2 explain the meaning of terms used in the Act and should not be read to define the meaning of terms used in a substitute decision-making document. The meaning of a term used in a substitute decision-making document is determined by the law of the jurisdiction under which the document was created. See Section 4 Comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definitions of “health care,” “personal care,” and “property” in this section are intended to be read in their broadest sense to include any substitute decision-making document created by an individual to authorize decisions with respect to that individual’s property, health care, or personal care. The scope of the decision-maker’s authority under such a document, however, is to be determined by the law under which the document was created. For example, authority with respect to “health care” may include authority to withhold or withdraw life prolonging procedures in some jurisdictions and not in others.

       Section 3(a) provides that a substitute decision-making document for property decisions executed in another jurisdiction will be recognized as valid if the execution of the document complied with the law under which the document was created. This approach to portability of substitute decision-making authority for property decisions is consistent with Section 106 of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to a substitute decision-making document for health care or personal care, Section 3(b) provides that a document created under the law of another jurisdiction is valid if the execution complied with the law under which the document was created or the law of the jurisdiction where the document is presented for acceptance. This approach to recognition of substitute decision-making documents for health care is followed by a number of states.
    See, e.g.,
    Conn. Gen. Stat. § 19a-580g (West 2011); N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 32A-27 (LexisNexis 2011); W. Va. Code § 16-30-21 (LexisNexis 2011). Section 3(b) is also consistent with Section 2(h) of the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (treating a power of attorney for health care as valid “if it complies with this [Act], regardless of when or where executed . . . .”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “jurisdiction” is intended to be read in its broadest sense to include any country or governmental subdivision that permits individuals to delegate substitute decision-making authority. While the effect of this section is to recognize the validity of a substitute decision-making document created under other law, it does not abrogate the traditional grounds for contesting the validity of execution such as forgery, fraud, or undue influence.
    This section also provides that unless another law in the jurisdiction requires presentation of the original substitute decision-making document, a photocopy or electronically transmitted copy has the same effect as the original. The term “law” is to be read broadly to include statutes, the common law, as well as court and administrative rules. An example of other law that might require presentation of the original substitute decision-making document is the mandate in most jurisdictions for presentation of an original power of attorney in conjunction with the recording of documents executed by an agent.

       This section provides that the meaning and effect of a substitute decision-making document is to be determined by the law under which it was created. Section 4 recognizes that a substitute decision-making document created in another jurisdiction may be subject to different default rules. For example, a decision maker with authority over insurance transactions may have authority to change beneficiary designations under the default rules of one jurisdiction but not so under the rules of another.
    See
    Unif. Power of Atty. Act § 107 cmt. (2006) (providing additional examples of common differences among power of attorney default rules). Likewise, the scope of authority under health care power of attorney and proxy statutes varies by jurisdiction.
       See
       Charles P. Sabatino,
       The Evolution of Health Care Advance Planning Law and Policy
       , 88 Milbank Q. 211, 221 (2010). Statutes or the common law in a jurisdiction may also impose public policy limits on a decision maker’s scope of authority in certain contexts or for certain medical procedures. Examples include decisions on behalf of pregnant patients and consent to forgo procedures such as artificially supplied nutrition and hydration or to perform procedures such as sterilization and psychosurgery.
       Id.
       Section 4 clarifies that an individual’s intended grant of authority will not be enlarged by virtue of the decision maker using the substitute decision-making document in a different jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section also establishes an objective means for determining what jurisdiction’s law was intended to govern the substitute decision-making document. The phrase, “the law of the jurisdiction indicated in the substitute decision-making document,” is intentionally broad, and includes any statement or reference in a substitute decision-making document that indicates an individual’s choice of law. Examples of an indication of jurisdiction include a reference to the name of the jurisdiction in the title or body of the substitute decision-making document, citation to the jurisdiction’s statute, or an explicit statement that the substitute decision-making document is created or executed under the laws of a particular jurisdiction. In the absence of an indication of jurisdiction in the substitute decision-making document, Section 4 provides that the law of the jurisdiction in which the substitute decision-making document was executed controls. The distinction between “the law of the jurisdiction indicated in the substitute decision-making document” and “the law of the jurisdiction in which the substitute decision-making document was executed” is an important one. For example, an individual may execute in one jurisdiction a power of attorney that was created and intended to be interpreted under the laws of another jurisdiction. A clear indication of the jurisdiction’s law that is intended to govern the meaning and effect of a substitute decision-making document is therefore advisable in all substitute decision-making documents.

       Section 5 permits a person to rely in good faith on the validity of a substitute decision-making document and the validity of the decision maker’s authority unless the person has actual knowledge to the contrary. The introductory phrase to subsection (a), “except as otherwise provided by statute other than this [act],” indicates that other relevant statutory provisions, such as those in a jurisdiction’s power of attorney statute or health care proxy statute, may supersede those in Section 5. For example, Section 119(b) of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act permits persons to rely on a presumption that an individual’s signature is genuine only if the power of attorney is purportedly acknowledged.
    See
    Unif. Power of Atty. Act § 119 cmt. (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent stricter requirements emanating from another statute in the jurisdiction, the Act does not require a person to investigate the validity of a substitute decision-making document or the decision maker’s authority. Although a person that is asked to accept a substitute decision-making document is not required to investigate the validity of the document, the person may, under subsection (b), request a decision maker’s assertion of any factual matter related to the substitute decision-making document and may request an opinion of counsel as to any matter of law. If the substitute decision-making document contains, in whole or part, language other than English, a translation may also be requested. Subsection (b) recognizes that a person that is asked to accept a substitute decision-making document may be unfamiliar with the law or the language of the jurisdiction intended to determine the meaning and effect of the document.

        As a complement to Section 5, Section 6 enumerates the bases for legitimate refusals of a substitute decision-making document and the sanctions for refusals that violate the Act. The introductory phrase, “except as otherwise provided . . . by law other than this [act],” allows a jurisdiction through common law and other statutes to impose stricter or different requirements for accepting a substitute decision-making document and the authority of the decision maker. For example, Section 120 of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (the “UPOAA”) requires that a power of attorney be accepted no later than seven business days after presentation. In a jurisdiction that has enacted the UPOAA, Section 120 would supersede the provision in Section 6 that requires a person to accept a substitute decision-making document “within a reasonable time.” With respect to substitute health care decisions, other statutes or the common law in a jurisdiction may impose public policy limits on a decision maker’s scope of authority in certain contexts or for certain medical procedures. See Section 4 Comment.
    Subsection (b) of Section 6 provides the bases upon which a substitute decision-making document may be refused without liability. The first paragraph of subsection (b) permits a person to refuse to act in response to the authority in a substitute decision-making document if “the person would not otherwise be required in the same circumstances to act if requested by the individual who executed the substitute decision-making document.” An example of such a circumstance in the health care context is a statute that permits an attending physician to refuse to use, withhold, or withdraw life prolonging procedures from a patient otherwise qualified to request use, withholding, or withdrawal of life prolonging procedures. See, e.g., Ind. Code § 16-36-4-13(e), -13(f) (West 2007). The UPOAA contains a similar basis for refusing substitute decision-making authority for property decisions. See Unif. Power of Atty. Act § 120(b)(1) (Alternative A) (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The last paragraph of subsection (b) permits refusal of an otherwise valid substitute decision-making document if the person believes that the individual for whom decisions will be made is subject to abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment by the decision maker or someone acting in concert with the decision maker (paragraph (5)). A refusal under this paragraph is protected if the person makes, or knows another person has made, a report to the governmental agency authorized to protect the welfare of the individual for whom decisions will be made. This basis for refusing an otherwise valid substitute decision-making document is also a feature of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act. See id. at § 120(b)(6) (Alternative A) (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) provides that a person that refuses a substitute decision-making document in violation of Section 6 is subject to a court order mandating acceptance and to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in the action to mandate acceptance. An unreasonable refusal may be subject to other remedies provided by other law. See Section 7 Comment.
