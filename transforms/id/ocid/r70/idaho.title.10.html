      In any civil action for damages, the amount of general damages sued for shall not be disclosed to the jury by court, counsel or any party and it shall be grounds for mistrial for any person to violate the prohibition of this act whether by specific statements or generalized argument. In furtherance of the provisions of this act it is declared that it is the exclusive province of the jury in a civil action for money damages involving allegations of general damages to resolve such issues of fact and it is against the policy of the state of Idaho for the jurors required to make such determinations to be informed of the particulars of allegations of damages in the pleadings on file with the court, by the arguments of counsel or otherwise, the dollar amount appraisal or evaluation of such damages being the exclusive province of the trier of fact; provided, this act shall not be construed to prohibit proof of damages or presentation of arguments which are legally relevant and proper in view of the record and issues before the court in any action for money damages.

        An attorney’s intentional, inflammatory, and unfair tactic to violate the statute and confuse and unfairly prejudice the jury should not be tolerated; such tactics require the firm application of this section which requires a mistrial and leaves no discretion to the trial court judge.

      A transcript or abstract of any judgment or decree of any court of this state or any court of the United States the enforcement of which has not been stayed as provided by law, if rendered within this state, certified by the clerk having custody thereof, may be recorded with the recorder of any county of this state, who shall immediately record and docket the same as by law provided, and from the time of such recording, and not before, the judgment so recorded becomes a lien upon all real property of the judgment debtor in the county, not exempt from execution, owned by him at the time or acquired afterwards at any time prior to the expiration of the lien; provided that where a transcript or abstract is recorded of any judgment or decree of divorce or separate maintenance making provision for installment or periodic payment of sums for maintenance of children or alimony or allowance for wife’s support, such judgment or decree shall be a lien only in an amount for payments so provided, delinquent or not made when due. The lien resulting from recording of a judgment other than for support of a child or for restitution owed to a crime victim where the order of restitution has been recorded as a judgment pursuant to section 19-5305, Idaho Code, continues ten (10) years from the date of the judgment, unless the judgment be previously satisfied, or unless the enforcement of the judgment be stayed upon an appeal as provided by law. A lien arising from the delinquency of a payment due under a judgment for support of a child issued by an Idaho court continues until ten (10) years after the death or emancipation of the last child for whom support is owed under the judgment unless the underlying judgment is renewed, is previously satisfied or the enforcement of the judgment is stayed upon an appeal as provided by law. A lien arising from an order for restitution to a crime victim where the order of restitution has been recorded as a judgment pursuant to section 19-5305, Idaho Code, continues until twenty (20) years from the date of the judgment, unless the judgment be previously satisfied, or unless the judgment is stayed or set aside. The transcript or abstract above mentioned shall contain the title of the court and cause and number of action, names of judgment creditors and debtors, time of entry and amount of judgment.

       The 2011 amendment, by ch. 104, rewrote the third sentence, which formerly read: “A lien arising from the delinquency of a payment due under a recorded judgment for support of a child after July 1, 1995, continues twenty-three (23) years from the date of judgment unless the judgment be previously satisfied or unless the enforcement of the judgment be stayed upon an appeal as provided by law”; and deleted the former fourth and fifth sentences, which read: “Provided, that no lien for child support shall continue more than five (5) years after the child reaches the age of majority or five (5) years after the child’s death, whichever shall first occur. If the recorded judgment is for the support of more than one (1) child, the lien shall continue until five (5) years after the youngest child reaches the age of majority or five (5) years after the death of the last remaining child, whichever shall first occur.”

       The 2015 amendment, by ch. 139, inserted “or for restitution owed to a crime victim where the order of restitution has been recorded as a judgment pursuant to section 19-5305, Idaho Code” in the second sentence and added the fourth sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2015 amendment, by ch. 278, substituted “ten (10) years” for “five (5) years” in the second and third sentences.

        Where creditor recorded a judgment in the county recorder’s office in July 2010, a judgment lien in favor of the creditor would attach to all of debtor’s after-acquired property in that county until the judgment is satisfied or lapses.

        In order to give full effect to the words and changes of the amendment made by the Laws of 1955, the creation of a judgment lien necessitates that a transcript or abstract of the judgment, certified by the clerk (or the original judgment as an “in county” judgment), be “filed with the clerk” of the district court, “who shall immediately file and docket the same as by law provided” and further necessitates that said abstract or transcript certified by the clerk be “filed with the . . . recorder,” who likewise “shall immediately file and docket the same as by law provided,” i.e., entered in the reception book maintained by the recorder. Messenger v. Burns, 86 Idaho 26, 382 P.2d 913 (1963). Renewed Judgment Lien.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since plaintiff’s renewed judgment lien was allowed to lapse and was not re-perfected until it was appropriately recorded, the rerecordation date was the date which then became the priority date for plaintiff’s interest in the subject property.

       <p>
        When a homebuyer tried to enforce a Utah judgment against a builder’s Idaho property, the builder was properly granted summary judgment because, inter alia, one basis for relief for the homebuyer was execution of a judgment lien based on the foreign judgment, but the judgment lien expired five [now 10] years after the entry of the judgment, and the homebuyer never tried to renew the lien or obtain a new lien.

       </p>
       <p>
        Section 10-1111 does not provide that a judgment lien may be renewed within five [now 10] years after the judgment is recorded.

        When a voluntary encumbrance or lien is placed on the land by the entryman, the lien attaches to the entryman’s interest, but this is not true on a default judgment, even though it is a voluntary impression of the judgment lien on the homestead permitted by the entryman. St. Marie v. Chester B. Brown Co., 84 Idaho 216, 370 P.2d 195 (1962).

        Where a debtor and her husband purchased a property as a married couple and resided there as their principal residence, the property was automatically protected by a homestead exemption under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c10s55-1004" target="_blank">§ 55-1004</a></cite>, and a creditor’s judgment, which was recorded thereafter, did not attach as a judgment lien pursuant to this section. However, when the debtor quitclaimed her interest to her husband and then he later quitclaimed her interest back, the judgment lien attached to her new interest at the same that she reacquired that interest. Because those acts occurred simultaneously, the debtor did not have an ownership interest, or a homestead exemption, prior to the lien affixing, and the property was subject to the judgment lien under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c10s55-1005" target="_blank">§ 55-1005</a></cite>.

        A payment actually tendered without condition, and without prejudice to the judgment creditor’s right to seek a larger award on appeal, will terminate the creditor’s right to statutory interest on the existing judgment. Long v. Hendricks, 109 Idaho 73, 705 P.2d 78 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant’s notice of tender of judgment authorized the clerk of the court to release the funds tendered to the court to the plaintiff upon the presentation of a satisfaction of judgment duly executed by the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not attempt to test the “condition” by presenting the clerk with a partial satisfaction of judgment or by seeking a court order to release the funds unconditionally pursuant to this section, the plaintiff failed to establish that he would have been prejudiced by accepting the tendered amount, and the tender of judgment barred the running of postjudgment interest on the original judgment. Long v. Hendricks, 109 Idaho 73, 705 P.2d 78 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a judgment debtor wishes to cut off the accrual of post-judgment interest, the tender of the amount of the judgment is sufficient. If by appealing the judgment creditor is not taking the risk of receiving less than the amount tendered, the judgment creditor may accept the tendered amount and continue with the appeal. If, however, the judgment creditor appeals the denial of a new trial and takes the risk of receiving less than the tendered amount, it is unfair to require the judgment debtor to pay post-judgment interest after the date of the tender, as the judgment debtor has no effective way of eliminating the obligation for post-judgment interest except by the tender. Long v. Hendricks, 117 Idaho 1051, 793 P.2d 1223 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record showed that respondent tendered the amount of the judgment to appellant, thus complying with this section, appellant refused to accept the tender, and the parties later stipulated to the deposit of the check into an interest-bearing account, respondent was not required to pay statutory interest on the judgment during the pendency of respondent’s cross-appeal. Curtis v. Canyon Hwy. Dist. No. 4, 122 Idaho 73, 831 P.2d 541 (1992), overruled on other grounds, Lawton v. City of Pocatello, 126 Idaho 454, 886 P.2d 330 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court correctly determined that postjudgment interest on the award of prejudgment interest began to accrue on the date of the judgment containing that award. Weaver v. Searle Bros., 131 Idaho 610, 962 P.2d 381 (1998).

        Judgment Satisfied.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Satisfaction should halt the accrual of not only postjudgment interest but also prejudgment interest as of the date of the deposit; after a judgment debtor unconditionally satisfies the judgment, both prejudgment and postjudgment interest should cease. Weaver v. Searle Bros., 131 Idaho 610, 962 P.2d 381 (1998). Judgment Satisfied.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant not only deposited funds representing the amount of the judgment against him with the district court but also authorized release of the funds to plaintiff, which release was ordered by the district court, the judgment was satisfied and there could be no appeal. Bob Rice Ford, Inc. v. Donnelly, 98 Idaho 313, 563 P.2d 37 (1977).

        Defendants’ deposit, when viewed as a whole, was not conditional because the accompanying letter clearly indicated defendants’ intent to satisfy the judgment and to send additional monies, if necessary. Weaver v. Searle Bros., 131 Idaho 610, 962 P.2d 381 (1998).

        Adverse Parties — Actual Controversy.
       </h5>
       <p>
        No judicial declaration is necessary or can be granted where there is no difference or threat, present or prospective, existing between the parties to the action or proceeding. State ex rel. Miller v. State Bd. of Educ., 56 Idaho 210, 52 P.2d 141 (1935); Whitney v. Randall, 58 Idaho 49, 70 P.2d 384 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Declaratory Judgment Act contemplates some specific adversary question or contention based on an existing state of facts, out of which the alleged “rights, status, and other legal relations” arise, upon which the court may predicate a judgment “either affirmative or negative in form and effect.” State ex rel. Miller v. State Bd. of Educ., 56 Idaho 210, 52 P.2d 141 (1935); Whitney v. Randall, 58 Idaho 49, 70 P.2d 384 (1937); State ex rel. Diefendorf v. Idaho Egg Producers, 59 Idaho 38, 80 P.2d 28 (1938); Thomas v. Riggs, 67 Idaho 223, 175 P.2d 404 (1946); Ayers v. General Hosp., 67 Idaho 430, 182 P.2d 958 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        There must be adverse parties and an actual controversy over the construction or validity of a statute or an instrument or other subject-matter coming properly within the purview of the Declaratory Judgment Act upon which the suit is based. Whitney v. Randall, 58 Idaho 49, 70 P.2d 384 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        No adversary controversy was tendered where plaintiff alleged that the contract was valid and that defendant was competent to contract. Defendant admitted and asserted the same facts. Plaintiff alleged: “That there exists an uncertainty as to the ability and capacity of the defendant to contract, and that this action is brought to quiet from the said title such uncertainty, and under the uniform Declaratory Judgment Act.” But it is nowhere alleged that defendant denies the contract or claims that he was incompetent to contract at the time it was executed, nor is it alleged that any member of his family, presumptive heir, or relative, who might be legally liable for his support, in case of his insanity and indigence, has questioned his competency or the validity of the contract. Whitney v. Randall, 58 Idaho 49, 70 P.2d 384 (1937); State ex rel. Diefendorf v. Idaho Egg Producers, 59 Idaho 38, 80 P.2d 28 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        If complaint for a declaratory judgment states a justiciable controversy, a general demurrer should be overruled. Grayot v. Summers, 75 Idaho 125, 269 P.2d 765 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right sought to be protected by a declaratory judgment may invoke either remedial or preventive relief; it may relate to a right that has either been breached or is only yet in dispute or a status undisturbed but threatened or endangered; but, in either or any event, it must involve actual and existing facts. Harris v. Cassia County, 106 Idaho 513, 681 P.2d 988 (1984).

        Attorney Fees.
       </h5>

       Should legislation be adopted permitting a public subdivision to voluntary withdrawal from PERSI (Public Employees Retirement System of Idaho), PERSI, while not having a fiduciary duty to challenge the legislation, would be charged with the responsibility of allowing political subdivisions to withdraw from the system and would, thus, have standing to bring a declaratory judgment action or to bring an original action in the supreme court seeking a judicial declaration of the validity of the statute before allowing any withdrawals; thus, by obtaining such a declaration prior to actually allowing employers to withdraw, PERSI could avoid the logistical problems that could be created if the statute were declared invalid after a number of employers had already withdrawn and employees brought an action seeking damages for PERSI’s breach of its fiduciary duty regarding employee’s benefits.<cite class="OAG">OAG 96-1</cite>.

        Failure to dismiss cross claim, in suit brought for the sole purpose of securing a declaration that an insurance policy had been obtained by fraudulent representations and concealment of facts, of the heirs of the people killed in an automobile collision with insured was error as insurance company was entitled to attack propriety of the cross-claim without waiving its right or the right of the insured to a jury trial on the issues raised thereby.

        There is no basis for preventing a foreign judgment creditor from pursuing parallel methods of satisfying his or her entire judgment. A judgment filed under the Idaho Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (EFJA) creates a lien on only real property, but, if a judgment debtor has insufficient real property to pay the entire judgment, it may be necessary to reach the debtor’s other property; accordingly, a judgment creditor is not forced to elect between filing a foreign judgment under the EFJA and pursuing an action based on the foreign judgment.

Section 5-215 applies only to an action upon a judgment requiring a judgment creditor to file a completely new case, but an EFJA filing does not involve initiating a new case; rather, under the EFJA, the foreign judgment is treated in the same manner as an Idaho judgment.

        The Idaho district court’s denial of defendant’s motion to strike a foreign judgment, which denial was based upon the district court’s determination as a matter of law, that the Alaska court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant, was in error, where the evidence raised a substantial factual question as to whether the defendant had had sufficient minimum contacts with Alaska so as to support the assertion of in personam jurisdiction by the Alaska court.

Civ. P. 60(b) motion to set aside a judgment filed by the Alaska judgment creditor pursuant to this section. P & R Enters., Inc. v. Guard, 102 Idaho 671, 637 P.2d 1167 (1981).

It is further the intent of the Legislature that the processes and procedures established by this act be used only for the important purposes for which they are intended. The Department of Health and Welfare shall, pursuant to Section 67 of this act, develop and maintain safeguards necessary to ensure that sensitive information about Idaho residents is not inappropriately disclosed so as to protect the privacy, safety or security of Idaho residents. If the petitioner is the subject of a no-contact order or similar protective order, the information disclosed shall not include the location of the Idaho resident. The state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the security of data and prevent disclosure to unauthorized persons, entities or jurisdictions. The Legislature finds that nothing in this act expands access to its databases beyond the access that already exists, and nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the exchange of data or information with other jurisdictions.”

     PREFATORY NOTE
    </h4>
    <p>
     This Act is a revision of the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act of 1962. That Act codified the most prevalent common law rules with regard to the recognition of money judgments rendered in other countries. The hope was that codification by a state of its rules on the recognition of foreign-country money judgments, by satisfying reciprocity concerns of foreign courts, would make it more likely that money judgments rendered in that state would be recognized in other countries. Towards this end, the Act sets out the circumstances in which the courts in states that have adopted the Act must recognize foreign-country money judgments. It delineates a minimum of foreign-country judgments that must be recognized by the courts of adopting states, leaving those courts free to recognize other foreign-country judgments not covered by the Act under principles of comity or otherwise. Since its promulgation over forty years ago, the 1962 Act has been adopted in a majority of the states and has been in large part successful in carrying out it purpose of establishing uniform and clear standards under which state courts will enforce the foreign-country money judgments that come within its scope.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act continues the basic policies and approach of the 1962 Act. Its purpose is not to depart from the basic rules or approach of the 1962 Act, which have withstood well the test of time, but rather to update the 1962 Act, to clarify its provisions, and to correct problems created by the interpretation of the provisions of that Act by the courts over the years since its promulgation. Among the more significant issues that have arisen under the 1962 Act which are addressed in this Revised Act are (1) the need to update and clarify the definitions section; (2) the need to reorganize and clarify the scope provisions, and to allocate the burden of proof with regard to establishing application of the Act; (3) the need to set out the procedure by which recognition of a foreign-country money judgment under the Act must be sought; (4) the need to clarify and, to a limited extent, expand upon the grounds for denying recognition in light of differing interpretations of those provisions in the current case law; (5) the need to expressly allocate the burden of proof with regard to the grounds for denying recognition; and (6) the need to establish a statute of limitations for recognition actions.
    In the course of drafting this Act, the drafters revisited the decision made in the 1962 Act not to require reciprocity as a condition to recognition of the foreign-country money judgments covered by the Act. After much discussion, the drafters decided that the approach of the 1962 Act continues to be the wisest course with regard to this issue. While recognition of U.S. judgments continues to be problematic in a number of foreign countries, there was insufficient evidence to establish that a reciprocity requirement would have a greater effect on encouraging foreign recognition of U.S. judgments than does the approach taken by the Act. At the same time, the certainty and uniformity provided by the approach of the 1962 Act, and continued in this Act, creates a stability in this area that facilitates international commercial transactions.

         The defined terms “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” in the 1962 Act have been changed to “foreign country” and “foreign-country judgment” in order to make it clear that the Act does not apply to recognition of sister-state judgments. Some courts have noted that the “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” definitions of the 1962 Act have caused confusion as to whether the Act should apply to sister-state judgments because “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” are terms of art generally used in connection with recognition and enforcement of sister-state judgments.
    See, e.g., Eagle Leasing v. Amandus
    , 476 N.W.2d 35 (Iowa 1991) (reversing lower court’s application of UFMJRA to a sister-state judgment, but noting lower court’s confusion was understandable as “foreign judgment” is term of art normally applied to sister-state judgments).

         The definition of “foreign-country judgment” in this Act differs significantly from the 1962 Act’s definition of “foreign judgment.” The 1962 Act’s definition served in large part as a scope provision for the Act. The part of the definition defining the scope of the Act has been moved to section 3 [§ 10-1403], which is the scope section.

        <li id="t10c14s10-1402-STATUTORYNOTESol13">
         The definition of “foreign-country judgment” in this Act refers to “a judgment” of “a court” of the foreign country. The foreign-country judgment need not take a particular form — any order or decree that meets the requirements of this section and comes within the scope of the Act under Section 3 [§ 10-1403] is subject to the Act. Similarly, any competent government tribunal that issues such a “judgment” comes within the term “court” for purposes of this Act. The judgment, however, must be a judgment of an adjudicative body of the foreign country, and not the result of an alternative dispute mechanism chosen by the parties. Thus, foreign arbitral awards and agreements to arbitrate are not covered by this Act. They are governed instead by federal law, Chapter 2 of the U.S. Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.201.html#t201c02s201-208" target="_blank">§§ 201-208</a></cite>, implementing the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and Chapter 3 of the U.S. Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.301.html#t301c03s301-307" target="_blank">§§ 301-307</a></cite>, implementing the Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration. A judgment of a foreign court confirming or setting aside an arbitral award, however, would be covered by this Act.
    4. The definition of “foreign-country judgment” does not limit foreign-country judgments to those rendered in litigation between private parties. Judgments in which a governmental entity is a party also are included, and are subject to this Act if they meet the requirements of this section and are within the scope of the Act under Section 3 [§ 10-1403].
        </li>

       <p>
        The 1962 Act defines a “foreign state” as “any governmental unit other than the United States, or any state, district, commonwealth, territory, insular possession thereof, or the Panama Canal Zone, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Ryuku Islands.” Rather than simply updating the list in the 1962 Act’s definition of “foreign state,” the new definition of “foreign country” in this Act combines the “listing” approach of the 1962 Act’s “foreign state” definition with a provision that defines “foreign country” in terms of whether the judgments of the particular government’s courts are initially subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause standards for determining whether those judgments will be recognized. Under this new definition, a governmental unit is a “foreign country” if it is (1) not the United States or a state, district, commonwealth, territory or insular possession of the United States; and (2) its judgments are not initially subject to Full Faith and Credit Clause standards.
    The Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, section 1, provides that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.” Whether the judgments of a governmental unit are subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause may be determined by judicial interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause or by statute, or by a combination of these two sources. For example, pursuant to the authority granted by the second sentence of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Congress has passed 28 U.S.C. § 1738, which provides
    inter alia
    that court records from “any State, Territory, or Possession of the United States” are entitled to full faith and credit under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. In
        Stoll v. Gottlieb
        , 305 U.S. 165, 170 (1938), the United States Supreme Court held that this statute also requires that full faith and credit be given to judgments of federal courts. States also have made determinations as to whether certain types of judgments are subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause.
        E.g. Day v. Montana Dept. of Social & Rehab. Servs.
        , 900 P.2d 296 (Mont. 1995) (tribal court judgment not subject to Full Faith and Credit, and should be treated with same deference shown foreign-country judgments). Under the definition of “foreign country” in this Act, the determination as to whether a governmental unit’s judgments are subject to full faith and credit standards should be made by reference to any relevant law, whether statutory or decisional, that is applicable “in this state.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of “foreign country” in terms of those judgments not subject to Full Faith and Credit standards also has the advantage of more effectively coordinating the Act with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. That Act, which establishes a registration procedure for the enforcement of sister state and equivalent judgments, defines a “foreign judgment” as “any judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or of any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in this state.” Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, § 1 (1964). By defining “foreign country” in the Recognition Act in terms of those judgments not subject to full faith and credit standards, this Act makes it clear that the Enforcement Act and the Recognition Act are mutually exclusive — if a foreign money judgment is subject to full faith and credit standards, then the Enforcement Act’s registration procedure is available with regard to its enforcement; if the foreign money judgment is not subject to full faith and credit standards, then the foreign money judgment may not be enforced until recognition of it has been obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Recognition Act.

        Source: This section is based on Section 2 of the 1962 Act. Subsection (b) [(2)] contains material that was included as part of the definition of “foreign judgment” in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act. Subsection (c) [(3)] is new.

         Like the 1962 Act, this Act sets out in subsection 3(a) [(1)] two basic requirements that a foreign-country judgment must meet before it comes within the scope of this Act — the foreign-country judgment must (1) grant or deny recovery of a sum of money and (2) be final, conclusive and enforceable under the law of the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 3(b) [(2)] then sets out three types of foreign-country judgments that are excluded from the coverage of this Act, even though they meet the criteria of subsection 3(a) [(1)] — judgments for taxes, judgments constituting fines and other penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. These exclusions are comparable to those contained in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act.

        <li id="t10c14s10-1403-RESEARCHREFERENCESol12">
         This Act applies to a foreign-country judgment only to the extent the foreign-country judgment grants or denies recovery of a sum of money. If a foreign-country judgment both grants or denies recovery of a sum money and provides for some other form of relief, this Act would apply to the portion of the judgment that grants or denies monetary relief, but not to the portion that provides for some other form of relief. The U.S. court, however, would be left free to decide to recognize and enforce the non-monetary portion of the judgment under principles of comity or other applicable law. See Section 11 [§ 10-1411].
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1403-RESEARCHREFERENCESol13">
         In order to come within the scope of this Act, a foreign-country judgment must be final, conclusive, and enforceable under the law of the foreign country in which it was rendered. This requirement contains three distinct, although inter-related concepts. A judgment is final when it is not subject to additional proceedings in the rendering court other than execution. A judgment is conclusive when it is given effect between the parties as a determination of their legal rights and obligations. A judgment is enforceable when the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor complies with the judgment are available to the judgment creditor to assist in collection of the judgment.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1403-RESEARCHREFERENCESol14">
         Subsection 3(b) [(2)] follows the 1962 Act by excluding three categories of foreign-country money judgments from the scope of the Act — judgments for taxes, judgments that constitute fines and penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. The domestic relations exclusion has been redrafted to make it clear that all judgments in domestic relations matters are excluded from the Act, not just judgments “for support” as provided in the 1962 Act. This is consistent with interpretation of the 1962 Act by the courts, which extended the “support” exclusion in the 1962 Act beyond its literal wording to exclude other money judgments in connection with domestic matters.
    E.g., Wolff v. Wolff
    , 389 A.2d 413 (Md. App. 1978) (“support” includes alimony).
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        While the first two of these requirements — finality and conclusiveness — will apply with regard to every foreign-country money judgment, the requirement of enforceability is only relevant when the judgment is one granting recovery of a sum of money. A judgment denying a sum of money obviously is not subject to enforcement procedures, as there is no monetary award to enforce. This Act, however, covers both judgments granting and those denying recovery of a sum of money. Thus, the fact that a foreign-country judgment denying recovery of a sum of money is not enforceable does not mean that such judgments are not within the scope of the Act. Instead, the requirement that the judgment be enforceable should be read to mean that, if the foreign-country judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, it must be enforceable in the foreign country in order to be within the scope of the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the 1962 Act, subsection 3(b) [(2)] requires that the determinations as to finality, conclusiveness and enforceability be made using the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered. Unless the foreign-country judgment is final, conclusive, and (to the extent it grants recovery of a sum of money) enforceable in the foreign country where it was rendered, it will not be within the scope of this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognition and enforcement of domestic relations judgments traditionally has been treated differently from recognition and enforcement of other judgments. The considerations with regard to those judgments, particularly with regard to jurisdiction and finality, differ from those with regard to other money judgments. Further, national laws with regard to domestic relations vary widely, and recognition and enforcement of such judgments thus is more appropriately handled through comity than through use of this uniform Act. Finally, other statutes, such as the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and the federal International Child Support Enforcement Act, 42 U.S.C. § 659a (1996), address various aspects of the recognition and enforcement of domestic relations awards. Under Section 11 [§ 10-1411] of this Act, courts are free to recognize money judgments in domestic relations matters under principles of comity or otherwise, and U.S. courts routinely enforce money judgments in domestic relations matters under comity principles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Foreign-country judgments for taxes and judgments that constitute fines or penalties traditionally have not been recognized and enforced in U.S. courts.
    See, e.g.,
    Restatement Third of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 483 (1986). Both the “revenue rule,” under which the courts of one country will not enforce the revenue laws of another country, and the prohibition on enforcement of penal judgments seem to be grounded in the idea that one country does not enforce the public laws of another.
    <i>
     See id.
    </i>
    Reporters’ Note 2. The exclusion of tax judgments and judgments constituting fines or penalties from the scope of the Act reflects this tradition. Under Section 11 [§ 10-1411], however, courts remain free to consider whether such judgments should be recognized and enforced under comity or other principles.
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment for taxes is a judgment in favor of a foreign country or one of its subdivisions based on a claim for an assessment of a tax. Thus, a judgment awarding a plaintiff restitution of the purchase price paid for an item would not be considered in any part a judgment for taxes, even though one element of the recovery was the sales tax paid by the plaintiff at the time of purchase. Such a judgment would not be one designed to enforce the revenue laws of the foreign country, but rather one designed to compensate the plaintiff. Courts generally hold that the test for whether a judgment is a fine or penalty is determined by whether its purpose is remedial in nature, with its benefits accruing to private individuals, or it is penal in nature, punishing an offense against public justice.
    E.g., Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Hoffman
    , 665 F. Supp 73 (D. Mass. 1987) (finding that Belgium judgment was not penal even though the proceeding forming the basis of the suit was primarily criminal where Belgium court considered damage petition a civil remedy, the judgment did not constitute punishment for an offense against public justice of Belgium, and benefit of the judgment accrued to private judgment creditor, not Belgium). Thus, a judgment that awards compensation or restitution for the benefit of private individuals should not automatically be considered penal in nature and therefore outside the scope of the Act simply because the action is brought on behalf of the private individuals by a government entity.
        Cf.
        U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, art. 14.7.2, U.S.-Austl., May 18, 2004 (providing that when government agency obtains a civil monetary judgment for purpose of providing restitution to consumers, investors, or customers who suffered economic harm due to fraud, judgment generally should not be denied recognition and enforcement on ground that it is penal or revenue in nature, or based on other foreign public law).
    5. Under subsection 3(b) [(2)], a foreign-country money judgment is not within the scope of this Act “to the extent” that it comes within one of the excluded categories. Therefore, if a foreign-country money judgment is only partially within one of the excluded categories, the non-excluded portion will be subject to this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        6. Subsection 3(c) [(3)] is new. The 1962 Act does not expressly allocate the burden of proof with regard to establishing whether a foreign-country judgment is within the scope of the Act. Courts applying the 1962 Act generally have held that the burden of proof is on the person seeking recognition to establish that the judgment is final, conclusive and enforceable where rendered.
    E.g., Mayekawa Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Sasaki
    , 888 P.2d 183, 189 (Wash. App. 1995) (burden of proof on creditor to establish judgment is final, conclusive, and enforceable where rendered);
        Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank
        , 45 F. Supp. 2d 276, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (party seeking recognition must establish that there is a final judgment, conclusive and enforceable where rendered);
        S.C. Chimexim S.A. v. Velco Enterprises, Ltd.
        , 36 F. Supp. 2d 206, 212 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (Plaintiff has the burden of establishing conclusive effect). Subsection (3)(c) [(3)] places the burden of proof to establish whether a foreign-country judgment is within the scope of the Act on the party seeking recognition of the foreign-country judgment with regard to both subsection (a) [(1)] and subsection (b) [(2)].

         This Section provides the standards for recognition of a foreign-country money judgment. Section 7 [§ 10-1407] sets out the effect of recognition of a foreign-country money judgment under this Act.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol12">
         Recognition of a judgment means that the forum court accepts the determination of legal rights and obligations made by the rendering court in the foreign country.
    See, e.g.
    Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, Ch. 5, Topic 3, Introductory Note (recognition of foreign judgment occurs to the extent the forum court gives the judgment “the same effect with respect to the parties, the subject matter of the action and the issues involved that it has in the state where it was rendered.”) Recognition of a foreign-country judgment must be distinguished from enforcement of that judgment. Enforcement of the foreign-country judgment involves the application of the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor obeys the foreign-country judgment. Recognition of a foreign-country money judgment often is associated with enforcement of the judgment, as the judgment creditor usually seeks recognition of the foreign-country judgment primarily for the purpose of invoking the enforcement procedures of the forum state to assist the judgment creditor’s collection of the judgment from the judgment debtor. Because the forum court cannot enforce the foreign-country judgment until it has determined that the judgment will be given effect, recognition is a prerequisite to enforcement of the foreign-country judgment. Recognition, however, also has significance outside the enforcement context because a foreign-country judgment also must be recognized before it can be given preclusive effect under res judicata and collateral estoppel principles. The issue of whether a foreign-country judgment will be recognized is distinct from both the issue of whether the judgment will be enforced, and the issue of the extent to which it will be given preclusive effect.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol13">
         Subsection 4(a) [(1)] places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize a foreign-country money judgment unless one of the grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) [(2)] or (c) [(3)] applies. Subsection (b) [(2)] states three mandatory grounds for denying recognition to a foreign-country money judgment. If the forum court finds that one of the grounds listed in subsection (b) [(2)] exists, then it must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment. Subsection (c) [(3)] states eight nonmandatory grounds for denying recognition. The forum court has discretion to decide whether or not to refuse recognition based on one of these grounds. Subsection (d) [(4)] places the burden of proof on the party resisting recognition of the foreign-country judgment to establish that one of the grounds for nonrecognition exists.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol14">
         The mandatory grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) [(2)] are identical to the mandatory grounds stated in Section 4 of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(1) [(3)(a)] through (6) [(3)(f)] are based on subsection 4(b)(1) through (6) of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(7) [(3)(g)] and (8) [(3)(h)] are new.

        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol15">
         Under subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)], the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment if that judgment was “rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law.” The standard for this ground for nonrecognition “has been stated authoritatively by the Supreme Court of the United States in
    Hilton v. Guyot
    , 159 U.S. 113, 205 (1895). As indicated in that decision, a mere difference in the procedural system is not a sufficient basis for nonrecognition. A case of serious injustice must be involved.” Cmt § 4, Uniform Foreign Money-Judgment Recognition Act (1962). The focus of inquiry is not whether the procedure in the rendering country is similar to U.S. procedure, but rather on the basic fairness of the foreign-country procedure.

    774 A.2d 644, 649 (N.J. App. 2001) (interpreting the comparable provision in the 1962 Act);
    
     accord, Society of Lloyd’s v. Ashenden
    
    , 233 F.3d 473 (7th Cir. 2000) (procedures need not meet all the intricacies of the complex concept of due process that has emerged from U.S. case law, but rather must be fair in the broader international sense) (interpreting comparable provision in the 1962 Act). Procedural differences, such as absence of jury trial or different evidentiary rules are not sufficient to justify denying recognition under subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)], so long as the essential elements of impartial administration and basic procedural fairness have been provided in the foreign proceeding. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in
    
     Hilton:
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol16">
         Under section 4(b)(2) [(2)(b)], the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Section 5(a) [§ 10-1405(1)] lists six bases for personal jurisdiction that are adequate as a matter of law to establish that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction. Section 5(b) [§ 10-1405(2)] makes clear that other grounds for personal jurisdiction may be found sufficient.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol17">
         Subsection 4(c)(2) [(3)(b)] limits the type of fraud that will serve as a ground for denying recognition to extrinsic fraud. This provision is consistent with the interpretation of the comparable provision in subsection 4(b)(2) of the 1962 Act by the courts, which have found that only extrinsic fraud — conduct of the prevailing party that deprived the losing party of an adequate opportunity to present its case — is sufficient under the 1962 Act. Examples of extrinsic fraud would be when the plaintiff deliberately had the initiating process served on the defendant at the wrong address, deliberately gave the defendant wrong information as to the time and place of the hearing, or obtained a default judgment against the defendant based on a forged confession of judgment. When this type of fraudulent action by the plaintiff deprives the defendant of an adequate opportunity to present its case, then it provides grounds for denying recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Extrinsic fraud should be distinguished from intrinsic fraud, such as false testimony of a witness or admission of a forged document into evidence during the foreign proceeding. Intrinsic fraud does not provide a basis for denying recognition under subsection 4(c)(2) [(3)(b)], as the assertion that intrinsic fraud has occurred should be raised and dealt with in the rendering court.

         The public policy exception in subsection 4(c)(3) [(3)(c)] is based on the public policy exception in subsection 4(b)(3) of the 1962 Act, with one difference. The public policy exception in the 1962 Act states that the relevant inquiry is whether “the [cause of action] [claim for relief] on which the judgment is based” is repugnant to public policy. Based on this “cause of action” language, some courts interpreting the 1962 Act have refused to find that a public policy challenge based on something other than repugnancy of the foreign cause of action comes within this exception.
    E.g., Southwest Livestock & Trucking Co., Inc. v. Ramon
    , 169 F.3d 317 (5th Cir. 1999) (refusing to deny recognition to Mexican judgment on promissory note with interest rate of 48% because cause of action to collect on promissory note does not violate public policy);
    
     Guinness PLC v. Ward
    
    , 955 F.2d 875 (4th Cir. 1992) (challenge to recognition based on post-judgment settlement could not be asserted under public policy exception);
    
     The Society of Lloyd’s v. Turner
    
    , 303 F.3d 325 (5th Cir. 2002) (rejecting argument legal standards applied to establish elements of breach of contract violated public policy because cause of action for breach of contract itself is not contrary to state public policy); cf.
    
     Bachchan v. India Abroad Publications, Inc.
    
    , 585 N.Y.S.2d 661 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992) (judgment creditor argued British libel judgment should be recognized despite argument it violated First Amendment because New York recognizes a cause of action for libel). Subsection 4(c)(3) [(3)(c)] rejects this narrow focus by providing that the forum court may deny recognition if either the cause of action or the judgment itself violates public policy. Cf. Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 482(2)(d) (1986) (containing a similarly-worded public policy exception to recognition).

        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol19">
         Subsection 4(c)(5) [(3)(e)] allows the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment when the parties had a valid agreement, such as a valid forum selection clause or agreement to arbitrate, providing that the relevant dispute would be resolved in a forum other than the forum issuing the foreign-country judgment. Under this provision, the forum court must find both the existence of a valid agreement and that the agreement covered the subject matter involved in the foreign litigation resulting in the foreign-country judgment.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1404-Citedol110">
         Subsection 4(c)(6) [(3)(f)] authorizes the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment that was rendered in the foreign country solely on the basis of personal service when the forum court believes the original action should have been dismissed by the court in the foreign country on grounds of
    forum non conveniens.
    11. Subsection 4(c)(7) [(3)(g)] is new. Under this subsection, the forum court may deny recognition to a foreign-country judgment if there are circumstances that raise substantial doubt about the integrity of the rendering court with respect to that judgment. It requires a showing of corruption in the particular case that had an impact on the judgment that was rendered. This provision may be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1) [(2)(a)], which requires that the forum court refuse recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals. Like the comparable provision in subsection 4(a)(1) of the 1962 Act, subsection 4(b)(1) [(2)(a)] focuses on the judicial system of the foreign country as a whole, rather than on whether the particular judicial proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment was impartial and fair.
    
     See, e.g., The Society of Lloyd’s v. Turner
    
    , 303 F.3d 325, 330 (5th Cir. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act);
    
     CIBC Mellon Trust Co. v. Mora Hotel Corp,. N.V.
    
    , 743 N.Y.S.2d 408, 415 (N.Y. App. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act);
    
     Society of Lloyd’s v. Ashenden
    
    , 233 F.3d 473, 477 (7th Cir. 2000) (interpreting the 1962 Act). On the other hand, subsection 4(c)(7) [(3)(g)] allows the court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it finds a lack of impartiality and fairness of the tribunal in the individual proceeding leading to the foreign- country judgment. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that corruption and bribery is so prevalent throughout the judicial system of the foreign country as to make that entire judicial system one that does not provide impartial tribunals versus showing that bribery of the judge in the proceeding that resulted in the particular foreign-country judgment under consideration had a sufficient impact on the ultimate judgment as to call it into question.

        [W]here there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent jurisdiction, conducting the trial upon regular proceedings, after due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant, and under a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between the citizens of its own country and those of other countries, and there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court, or in the system of laws under which it was sitting, or fraud in procuring the judgment, or any other special reason why the comity of this nation should not allow it full effect [then a foreign-country judgment should be recognized.]

       <p>
        Although subsection 4(c)(3) [(3)(c)] of this Act rejects the narrow focus on the cause of action under the 1962 Act, it retains the stringent test for finding a public policy violation applied by courts interpreting the 1962 Act. Under that test, a difference in law, even a marked one, is not sufficient to raise a public policy issue. Nor is it relevant that the foreign law allows a recovery that the forum state would not allow. Public policy is violated only if recognition or enforcement of the foreign-country judgment would tend clearly to injure the public health, the public morals, or the public confidence in the administration of law, or would undermine “that sense of security for individual rights, whether of personal liberty or of private property, which any citizen ought to feel.”
    Hunt v. BP Exploration Co. (Libya) Ltd.
    , 492 F. Supp. 885, 901 (N.D. Tex. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language “or of the United States” in subsection 4(c)(3) [(3)(c)], which does not appear in the 1962 Act provision, makes it clear that the relevant public policy is that of both the State in which recognition is sought and that of the United States. This is the position taken by the vast majority of cases interpreting the 1962 public policy provision.
    E.g., Bachchan v. India Abroad Publications, Inc.
    , 585 N.Y.S.2d 661 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. 1992) (British libel judgment denied recognition because it violates First Amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        12. Subsection 4(c)(8) [(3)(h)] also is new. It allows the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the court finds that the specific proceeding in the foreign court was not compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. Like subsection 4(c)(7) [(3)(g)], it can be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1) [(2)(a)], which requires the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the forum court finds that the entire judicial system in the foreign country where the foreign-country judgment was rendered does not provide procedures compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. While the focus of subsection 4(b)(1) [(2)(a)] is on the foreign country’s judicial system as a whole, the focus of subsection 4(c)(8) [(3)(h)] is on the particular proceeding that resulted in the specific foreign-country judgment under consideration. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that there has been such a breakdown of law and order in the particular foreign country that judgments are rendered on the basis of political decisions rather than the rule of law throughout the judicial system versus a showing that for political reasons the particular party against whom the foreign-country judgment was entered was denied fundamental fairness in the particular proceedings leading to the foreign-country judgment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsections 4(c)(7) [(3)(g)] and (8) [(3)(h)] both are discretionary grounds for denying recognition, while subsection 4(b)(1) [(2)(a)] is mandatory. Obviously, if the entire judicial system in the foreign country fails to satisfy the requirements of impartiality and fundamental fairness, a judgment rendered in that foreign country would be so compromised that the forum court should refuse to recognize it as a matter of course. On the other hand, if the problem is evidence of a lack of integrity or fundamental fairness with regard to the particular proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment, then there may or may not be other factors in the particular case that would cause the forum court to decide to recognize the foreign-country judgment. For example, a forum court might decide not to exercise its discretion to deny recognition despite evidence of corruption or procedural unfairness in a particular case because the party resisting recognition failed to raise the issue on appeal from the foreign-country judgment in the foreign country, and the evidence establishes that, if the party had done so, appeal would have been an adequate mechanism for correcting the transgressions of the lower court.
    13. Under subsection 4(d) [(4)], the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment has the burden of establishing that one of the grounds for nonrecognition set out in subsection 4(b) [(2)] or (c) [(3)] applies. The 1962 Act was silent as to who had the burden of proof to establish a ground for nonrecognition and courts applying the 1962 Act took different positions on the issue.
    Compare Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank
    , 45 F. Supp. 2d 276, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (plaintiff has burden to show no mandatory basis under 4(a) for nonrecognition exists; defendant has burden regarding discretionary bases)
    <i>
     with The Courage Co. LLC v. The ChemShare Corp.
    </i>
    , 93 S.W.3d 323, 331 (Tex. App. 2002) (party seeking to avoid recognition has burden to prove ground for nonrecognition). Because the grounds for nonrecognition in Section 4 [§ 10-1404] are in the nature of defenses to recognition, the burden of proof is most appropriately allocated to the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment.

         Unlike the 1962 Act, which was silent as to the proper procedure for seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment, Section 6 [this section] of this Act expressly sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition may be raised. Under section 6 [this section], the issue of recognition always must be raised in a court proceeding. Thus, section 6 [this section] rejects decisions under the 1962 Act holding that the registration procedure found in the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act could be utilized with regard to recognition of a foreign-country judgment.
    E.g. Society of Lloyd’s v. Ashenden
    , 233 F.3d 473 (7th Cir. 2000). The Enforcement Act deals solely with the
    
     enforcement
    
    of sister-state judgments and other judgments entitled to full faith and credit, not with the
    
     recognition
    
    of foreign-country judgments.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1406-STATUTORYNOTESol12">
         This Section contemplates that the issue of recognition may be raised either as an original matter or in the context of a pending proceeding. Subsection 6(a) [(1)] provides that in order to raise the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment as an initial matter, the party seeking recognition must file an action for recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Subsection 6(b) [(2)] provides that when the recognition issue is raised in a pending proceeding, it may be raised by counterclaim, cross-claim or affirmative defense, depending on the context in which it is raised. These rules are consistent with the way the issue of recognition most often was raised in most states under the 1962 Act.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1406-STATUTORYNOTESol13">
         An action seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment under this Section is an action on the foreign-country judgment itself, not an action on the underlying cause of action that gave rise to that judgment. The parties to an action under Section 6 [this section] may not relitigate the merits of the underlying dispute that gave rise to the foreign-country judgment.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c14s10-1406-STATUTORYNOTESol14">
         While this Section sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be raised, it is not intended to create any new procedure not currently existing in the state or to otherwise effect existing state procedural requirements. The parties to an action in which recognition of a foreign-country judgment is sought under Section 6 [this section] must comply with all state procedural rules with regard to that type of action. Nor does this Act address the question of what constitutes a sufficient basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate with regard to an action under Section 6 [this section]. Courts have split over the issue of whether the presence of assets of the debtor in a state is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction in light of footnote 36 of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 210 n.36 (1977). This Act takes no position on that issue.
    5. In states that have adopted the Uniform Foreign-Money Claims Act, that Act will apply to the determination of the amount of a money judgment recognized under this Act.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        More broadly, section 6 [this section] rejects the use of any registration procedure in the context of the foreign-country judgments covered by this Act. A registration procedure represents a balance between the interest of the judgment creditor in obtaining quick and efficient recognition and enforcement of a judgment when the judgment debtor has already been provided with an opportunity to litigate the underlying issues, and the interest of the judgment debtor in being provided an adequate opportunity to raise and litigate issues regarding whether the foreign-country judgment should be recognized. In the context of sister-state judgments, this balance favors use of a truncated procedure such as that found in the Enforcement Act. Recognition of sister-state judgments normally is mandated by the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Courts recognize only a very limited number of grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment — that the rendering court lacked jurisdiction, that the judgment was procured by fraud, that the judgment has been satisfied, or that the limitations period has expired. Thus, the judgment debtor with regard to a sister-state judgment normally does not have any grounds for opposing recognition and enforcement of the judgment. The extremely limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment reflect the fact such judgments will have been rendered by a court that is subject to the same due process limitations and the same overlap of federal statutory and constitutional law as the forum state’s courts, and, to a large extent, the same body of court precedent and socio-economic ideas as those shaping the law of the forum state. Therefore, there is a strong presumption of fairness and competence attached to a sister-state judgment that justifies use of a registration procedure.
    The balance between the benefits and costs of a registration procedure is significantly different, however, in the context of recognition and enforcement of foreign-country judgments. Unlike the limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment, this Act provides a number of grounds upon which recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be denied. Determination of whether these grounds apply requires the forum court to look behind the foreign-country judgment to evaluate the law and the judicial system under which the foreign- country judgment was rendered. The existence of these grounds for nonrecognition reflects the fact there is less expectation that foreign-country courts will follow procedures comporting with U.S. notions of fundamental fairness and jurisdiction or that those courts will apply laws viewed as substantively tolerable by U.S. standards than there is with regard to sister-state courts. In some situations, there also may be suspicions of corruption or fraud in the foreign-country proceedings. These differences between sister-state judgments and foreign-country judgments provide a justification for requiring judicial involvement in the decision whether to recognize a foreign- country judgment in all cases in which that issue is raised. Although the threshold for establishing that a foreign-country judgment is not entitled to recognition under Section 4 [§ 10-1404] is high, there is a sufficiently greater likelihood that significant recognition issues will be raised so as to require a judicial proceeding.

         Section 5 [§ 10-1405] of this Act sets out the standards for the recognition of foreign-country judgments within the scope of this Act, and places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize any foreign-country judgment that meets those standards. Section 6 [§ 10-1406] of this Act sets out the procedures by which the issue of recognition may be raised. This Section sets out the consequences of the decision by the forum court that the foreign-country judgment is entitled to recognition.

         Under subsection 7(1), the first consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that it is treated as conclusive between the parties in the forum state. Section 7(1) does not attempt to establish directly the extent of that conclusiveness. Instead, it provides that the foreign-country judgment is treated as conclusive to the same extent that a judgment of a sister state that had been determined to be entitled to full faith and credit would be conclusive. This means that the foreign-country judgment generally will be given the same effect in the forum state that it has in the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 7(1), however, sets out the minimum effect that must be given to the foreign-country judgment once recognized. The forum court remains free to give the foreign-country judgment a greater preclusive effect in the forum state than the judgment would have in the foreign country where it was rendered.

    Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 481 cmt

         Under subsection 7(2), the second consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that, to the extent it grants a sum of money, it is enforceable in the forum state in accordance with the procedures for enforcement in the forum state and to the same extent that a judgment of the forum state would be enforceable.
    Cf.
    Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 481 (1986) (judgment entitled to recognition is enforceable in accordance with the procedure for enforcement of judgments applicable where enforcement is sought). Thus, under subsection 7(2), once recognized, the foreign-country judgment has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying a judgment of a comparable court in the forum state, and can be enforced or satisfied in the same manner as such a judgment of the forum state.

         Under Section 3 [§ 10-1403] of this Act, a foreign-country judgment is not within the scope of this Act unless it is conclusive and enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the effect of appeal under the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered is to prevent it from being conclusive or enforceable between the parties, the existence of a pending appeal in the foreign country would prevent the application of this Act. Section 8 [this section] addresses a different situation. It deals with the situation in which either (1) the party seeking a stay has demonstrated that it intends to file an appeal in the foreign country, although the appeal has not yet been filed or (2) an appeal has been filed in the foreign country, but under the law of the foreign country filing of an appeal does not affect the conclusiveness or enforceability of the judgment. Section 8 [this section] allows the forum court in those situations to determine in its discretion that a stay of proceedings is appropriate.

        Source: This Section is new. The 1962 Act did not contain a statute of limitations. Some courts applying the 1962 Act have used the state’s general statute of limitations, e.g., Vrozos v. Sarantopoulos, 552 N.E.2d 1053 (Ill. App. 1990) (as Recognition Act contains no statute of limitations, general five-year statute of limitations applies), while others have used the statute of limitations applicable with regard to enforcement of a domestic judgment, e.g., La Societe Anonyme Goro v. Conveyor Accessories, Inc., 677 N.E. 2d 30 (Ill. App. 1997).

         Under Section 3 [§ 10-1403] of this Act, this Act only applies to foreign-country judgments that are conclusive, and if the judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the period of effectiveness of the foreign-country judgment has expired in the foreign country where the judgment was rendered, the foreign-country judgment would not be subject to this Act. This means that the period of time during which a foreign-country judgment may be recognized under this Act normally is measured by the period of time during which that judgment is effective (that is, conclusive and, if applicable, enforceable) in the foreign country that rendered the judgment. If, however, the foreign-country judgment remains effective for more than fifteen years after the date on which it became effective in the foreign country, Section 9 [this section] places an additional time limit on recognition of a foreign-country judgment. It provides that, if the foreign-country judgment remains effective between the parties for more than fifteen years, then an action to recognize the foreign-country judgment under this Act must be commenced within that fifteen year period.

For example, a common rule with regard to judgments barred by a statute of limitations is that they still may be used defensively for purposes of offset and for their preclusive effect. The extent to which a foreign-country judgment with regard to which a recognition action is barred by Section 9 [this section] may be used for these or other purposes is left to the other law of the forum state.

         Section 3 [§ 10-1411] of this Act provides that this Act applies only to certain foreign-country judgments that grant or deny recovery of a sum of money. The purpose of this Act is to establish the minimum standards for recognition of those judgments. Section 11 [this section] makes clear that no negative implication should be read from the fact that this Act does not provide for recognition of other foreign-country judgments. Rather, this Act simply does not address the issue of whether foreign-country judgments not within its scope under Section 3 [§ 10-1411] should be recognized. Courts are free to recognize those foreign-country judgments not within the scope of this Act under common law principles of comity or other applicable law.

         “Action.” A suit or arbitration may be legal or equitable in nature, but it must be based on a pecuniary claim.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol12">
         “Bank-offered spot rate” is the rate at which a bank will sell the requisite amount of foreign money for immediate or nearly immediate use by the buyer.

        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol13">
         “Conversion date.” Exchange rates may fluctuate from day to day. A date must be picked for calculating the value of foreign money in terms of United States dollars. As used in the Act, “conversion date” means the day before a foreign-money claim is paid or set-off. The day refers to the time period of the place of the payor, not necessarily that of the recipient. The exchange rate prevailing at or near the close of business on the banking day before the day payment is made will be well known at the time of payment. See Comment 2 to Section 7 [§ 10-1507].
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol14">
         “Distribution proceeding.” In keeping with the concept underlying Section 2 [§ 10-1502], the coverage of this statute is limited to judicial actions and nonjudicial proceedings which involve the creation of a fund from which pro-rata distributions are made to claimants. As provided in Section 8 [§ 10-1508], a different conversion date is required where either input to or outgo from a fund involves two or more different moneys. Thus, the term includes a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, judicial or under a trust deed, distribution of property in divorce and child support proceedings, distributions in the administration of a trust or a decedent’s estate, an assignment for the benefit of creditors, an equity receivership, a liquidation by a statutory successor, a voluntary dissolution of a business or a nonprofit enterprise or the like when in each case a fund must be shared among claimants and where, usually, the fund will not satisfy all claimants of the same class. An asset or a liability of the fund must also involve one or more foreign-money claims, but not all of the claims can be in the same money.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol15">
         “Foreign money.” Since only the federal government has the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, the term “foreign” means a government other than that of the United States of America. Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund are foreign money even though the United States is a member of the Fund. Foreign governments included are all those whose moneys are, in the currency markets of the world, exchangeable for the money of other currencies even though the government is not recognized by the United States.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol16">
         “Foreign-money claim.” The term “claim” is not limited to any one party to an action or a distribution proceeding and may be asserted by a plaintiff or a defendant or by a party to an arbitration or distribution proceeding. It may be based on a foreign judgment, or sound in contract, quasi-contract, or tort.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol17">
         “Money.” The definition includes composite currencies such as European Currency Units created by agreement of the governments that are members of the European Monetary System or the Special Drawing Rights created under the auspices of the International Money Fund. These are ‘stores of value’ used to determine the quantity of payment in some international transactions.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol18">
         “Money of the claim.” See Section 4 [§ 10-1504] and the Comment thereto.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol19">
         “Party.” This combines the Uniform Commercial Code’s definitions of “person” and “organization,” but is limited to those who are parties to transactions or involved in events which could give rise to a foreign-money claim.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol110">
         “Rate of Exchange.” A free market rate is to be used rather than an official rate if both exist. Some countries have transactional differences in exchange rates with slightly different rates; for example, in Belgium one rate prevails for commercial and another for financial transactions. Both rates are recognized in money market transactions. The last sentence of the definition indicates that the rate appropriate to the transaction is the rate to be used.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol111">
         “Spot rate” is the term used in the financial markets of the United States for the rate of exchange for immediate or nearly immediate transfers from one money to another, as distinguished from the rates for future options or future deliveries.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1501-STATUTORYNOTESol112">
         “State.” The definition, as in other Uniform Laws, is extended to include areas given the same, or nearly the same, treatment in law as the states.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        In the foreign exchange markets, as in the stock markets, quotations are either “bid” or “ask,” and the spread between is where the dealer makes a profit. An “offered spot rate” is the rate at which the offeror will sell the particular money. It is, of course, higher than the rate at which that person will buy the same money. “Spot” refers to the time the trade is made, not the time for settlement, which in spot transactions is often two days after the date of the trade.

         A basic policy of the Act is to preserve freedom of contract and to permit parties to resolve disputed matters by contract at any time, even as to choice of law problems. The parties may agree upon the date and time for conversion. After entry of judgment the parties may agree upon how the judgment is to be satisfied.

         Subsection (b) covers cases where, for example, claims for petroleum may be settled in United States dollars but settlement for joint costs of exploration may be in pounds sterling. The parties also may agree on the money to be used for damages. The second sentence recognizes that a price stated in a particular money does not indicate, without more evidence, an intent that all damages from breach are to be in the same money. The principle of freedom of contract allows the parties to allocate the risks of currency fluctuations between foreign moneys as they desire. Sections 4 [§ 10-1504] and 5 [§ 10-1505] provide rules in the absence of special agreements by the parties for determining the money to be used. Parties may by agreement select a particular market or foreign exchange dealer to be used for exchange purposes.

         Subsection (a) uses “payment” in a broad sense not related to just the price, but to any obligation arising out of a contract to transfer money. See also Section 3(b) [§ 10-1503(b)].

         Subsection (b) states rules to fill gaps in the agreement of the parties with rules as to the allocation of risks of fluctuations in exchange rates. The three rules will normally apply in the order stated. Prior dealings may indicate the desired money. If there are none, it is appropriate to use the money indicated by trade usage or custom for transactions of like kind. The final rule of subsection (a) is one established in English cases. See
    The Despina R and the Folias

An example is the use of an operating account in United States dollars by a French company to buy Japanese yen for ship repairs; the loss is felt in the depletion of the dollar bank account. Appropriateness of a rule is to be determined by the judge from the facts of the case. See Section 6(d) [§ 10-1506(d)].

       If an amount contracted to be paid in a foreign money is to be measured by a different money at the rate of exchange prevailing on a date before default, that rate of exchange applies only to payments made within a reasonable time after default, not exceeding thirty (30) days.

       A monetary claim is neither usurious nor unconscionable because the agreement on which it is based provides that the amount of the debtor’s obligation to be paid in the debtor’s money, when received by the creditor, must equal a specified amount of the foreign money of the country of the creditor. If, because of unexcused delay in payment of a judgment or award, the amount received by the creditor does not equal the amount of the foreign money specified in the agreement, the court or arbitrator shall amend the judgment or award accordingly.

         Subsections (a) and (b) cover different interpretation problems. One arises where the amount of the money to be paid is measured by another money, one of which is foreign. An example is “pay 5,000 Swiss francs in pounds sterling.” The issue is the time at which the rate of exchange into pounds sterling is to be applied. Subsection (a) says in a “measured by” situation with no rate specified, the rate of exchange that controls is the one prevailing at or near the close of business on the day before the day of payment. See Section 1(3) [§ 10-1501(3)], the definition of “conversion date.”
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1505-STATUTORYNOTESol12">
         Another problem arises when an exchange rate in effect before a default is used, as in “pay on November 30, 1989, 5,000 Swiss francs in pounds sterling at the exchange rate prevailing on June 30, 1989.” In this case, the issue is how long does the specified exchange rate control in the absence of a clear expression of intent?
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1505-STATUTORYNOTESol13">
         The most common application of subsection (c) will be found in international loan transactions. For example, a loan by a Japanese bank to an American company could be made with dollars purchased by yen for the purpose. The loan agreement could provide for repayment in dollars of an amount which, when received by the lender, would repurchase the amount of yen used to acquire the dollars advanced.
    An exemption is needed from the application of usury laws that may be interpreted to hold that the indexing of the principal amount creates additional interest. See
    Aztec Properties, Inc. v. Union Planters National Bank
    , 530 S.W.2d 756 (Tenn. Sup. Ct. 1975). The subsection removes all doubts as to the legal enforceability of such agreements under theories such as usury, merger in a judgment, unconscionability, or the like.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Inclusion of a fixed rate as of a date before default, under subsection (b), remains effective only if payment is made within a reasonable time after default, not to exceed 30 days. The 30-day limitation accords usually with the expectation of the parties. Parties may agree to a longer time.

         Subsection (a) changes a number of statutes in the states which can be construed to require all values in legal proceedings to be expressed in United States dollars. Professor Brand, in his article in the Yale Journal of International Law, Vol. 11:139 at page 169, identified 18 states having statutes which could require all judgments to be entered in dollars. They are Arkansas, California, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Brand, ibid. fn. 166. Hence, direct statutory authority must be given the courts in those states, and will be helpful in other states. In some states other statutes may need amendments. See, e.g., Wisc. Stats. §§ 138.01, 138.02, 138.03, and 779.05.

         Subsection (d) gives defendants the option of paying in dollars which are, at the payment date, practically the economic equivalent of the foreign money awarded. The judgment creditor should be indifferent to whether the debtor exercises the right to pay in dollars as the only difference is a small bank charge for exchanging the dollars for the foreign money. The concept of the rate of the banking day next before the payment day is taken from Section 131 of the Province of Ontario, Canada, Courts of Justice Act (Ch. 11 Ont. Stats. (1984) as recently amended). It gives the defendant and the sheriff conducting the sale the necessary conversion rate comfortably ahead of its use. Newspaper quotations are usually said to be “at or near the close of business” on the stated date, so that phrase is used in this Act.

         Subsection (e) provides for netting the affirmative recoveries of a defendant and plaintiff, whether in the same money or in different moneys, but preserving the quantum of each for appellate purposes. The theory is that when claims are reduced to money, they become mutual debts and should be set-off, so that a person’s exchange rate fluctuation risk continues only for the surplus in its money of the claim. The set-off is made by the judge or arbitrator.

         As to pre-judgment interest, the Act adopts the majority rule in the United States that pre-judgment interest follows the substantive law of the case under conflict of laws rules, both as to the right to recover and the rate. English courts use a different rule, i.e., the borrowing rate used by plaintiff or prevailing in the country issuing the money of the judgment. See
    Helmsing Schiffarts G.M.B.H. v. Malta Drydock Corp.
    (1977) 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 44 (Maltese money but borrowed in West Germany; German rate);
    
     Miliangos v. George Frank (Textiles) Ltd. (No. 2)
    
    (1976) 1 QB 487 at 489 (Swiss money, Swiss interest rate). Although pre-judgment interest is one form of damages, provision for pre-judgment interest is not to be taken as indicating that no other damages for delay in payment can be awarded under the substantive law applicable to the determination of damages. Cf.
    
     Isaac Naylor & Sons, Ltd. v. New Zealand Co-operative Wool Marketing Association, Ltd.
    
    (1981) 1 N.Z.L.R. 361 (exchange loss due to delay as additional damages).

         Allowances of pre-judgment interest in some states depend upon a party’s conduct with respect to settlement or delay of the proceeding. Subsection (b) treats these state laws as either procedural in nature or expressions of a significant policy, in either case to be governed by the law of the forum state.
        </li>
        <li id="t10c15s10-1509-STATUTORYNOTESol13">
         Interest on a judgment is considered to be procedural and also goes by the law of the forum. There is a problem here in that there is great discrepancy among the states in the rates for judgment interest. When a judgment is in a foreign money, United States interest rates may result in some overcompensation or undercompensation as compared to what would be awarded in the jurisdiction issuing the foreign money. But in both the United States and in foreign countries, most jurisdictions have fixed statutory rates that do not readily respond to the inflation or deflation of the value of their money in the world market. Hence it was decided to apply the usual rules of the conflict of laws.
