       <p>
        Since an action on an indemnity agreement does not accrue until the indemnitor suffers damage or loss, the five-year statute of limitations on written contracts did not bar a warehouse bond surety’s action against the warehouseman for indemnification pursuant to a 1964 indemnity agreement, where the surety’s action did not accrue until 1973, when the state closed the bonded warehouse. State Dep’t of Agric. v. Millers Nat’l Ins. Co., 97 Idaho 323, 543 P.2d 1163 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an application for a grain warehouse bond included an indemnity agreement whereby the applicant warehouseman agreed to indemnify the bond surety for any losses sustained by reason of issuance of the bond, and where a clause in the application provided that the application terms would be applied for every continuation, renewal, substitute or new bond, the warehouseman was therefore bound by the indemnity agreement on the execution of a subsequent bond and annual continuations thereof. State Dep’t of Agric. v. Millers Nat’l Ins. Co., 97 Idaho 323, 543 P.2d 1163 (1975).

        In an action for conversion of wheat against a corporation which operated a warehouse previously operated by a copartnership, but later forfeited its charter, leaving former partners as its reputed directors, officers, and agents, and also against such partners and surety on warehouseman’s bond, wherein it was shown that the bond furnished to the corporation was in effect at time of the conversion, error in finding that bond furnished to the partners was then in effect was harmless.

        An insurance adjuster’s unauthorized sale and delivery of wheat stored in warehouse, with acquiescence of the warehouse company, because of a fire in the warehouse, permanently deprived the owner of his property and constituted actionable conversion, for which buyer of wheat, warehouse company and surety on warehouseman’s bond were liable.

        Where intervenor sold warehouseman all but 20,000 pounds of his 1954 oats crop for which warehouseman paid by check and both parties agreed that warehouseman should sell remainder of 1954 crop and all of 1955 crop to a prospective buyer but when sale failed to materialize and warehouseman retained the oats and intervenor learned that warehouseman’s check had failed to clear the bank intervenor made demand on warehouseman for oats and received two warehouse receipts covering the entire two crops and later check cleared the bank but the receipt for the 1954 crop was neither reduced nor canceled, the evidence was clear that the relationship between the intervenor and the warehouseman was not that of bailor-bailee which normally results from conducting warehouse business but was that of purchaser-seller or that warehouseman was acting as commercial agent or factor for the intervenor.

      § 69-208. Bond of applicant for license — Additional bond — Additional obligations — Certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit in lieu of bond — Single bond.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each warehouseman applying for a license to conduct a warehouse in accordance with this chapter shall, as a condition to the granting thereof, execute and file with the department a good and sufficient bond other than personal security. The bond shall be in favor of the commodity indemnity fund to secure the faithful performance of his obligations as a warehouseman under all the laws of the state, including obligations arising by operation of the commodity indemnity fund program, and the rules prescribed hereunder, and of such additional obligations as a warehouseman as may be assumed by him under contracts with the respective depositors of agricultural commodities in such warehouse. Said bond shall be in such form and amount, shall have such surety or sureties, and shall contain such terms and conditions as the department may prescribe to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Whenever the department shall determine that a bond approved by it is, or for any cause has become, insufficient, it shall require an additional bond or bonds to be given by the warehouseman concerned, conforming with the requirements of this section, and unless the same be given within the time fixed by a written demand therefor the license of such warehouseman shall be suspended or revoked.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bond shall be approved by the department and shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance by the warehouseman of the duty to keep in the warehouse for the depositor the agricultural commodity delivered and to deliver the agricultural commodity to or for such depositors. The bond shall also be conditioned upon the faithful performance by the warehouseman of any additional obligations involving marketing transactions with a depositor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The warehouseman may give a single bond meeting the requirements as provided in this chapter and all warehouses operated by the warehouseman shall be as one (1) warehouse for the purpose of compliance with the provisions of this section. At the discretion of the director, any person required to submit a bond to the department in accordance with this chapter, may give to the department a certificate of deposit or an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the commodity indemnity fund in lieu of the bond required herein. The principal amount of the certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall be the same as that required for a surety bond pursuant to this chapter. Accrued interest upon the certificate of deposit shall be payable to the purchaser of the certificate. The irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit shall remain on file with the department until it is released, canceled or discharged by the director or until the director is notified ninety (90) days in advance, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, that the irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit is renewed, canceled or amended. Failure to notify the director may result in the suspension or revocation of the bonded warehouse license. The provisions of this chapter that apply to a bond required pursuant to this chapter apply to each certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit given in lieu of such bond.
    Under provisions of this chapter, an irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit shall not be acceptable unless it is issued by a national bank or federal thrift institution in Idaho or by a state-chartered bank or thrift institution authorized to conduct business in Idaho and insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any changes in the capacity of a warehouse or installation of any new warehouses involving a change in the bond liability under the provisions of this chapter shall be reported to the department prior to the operation thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a warehouseman is licensed pursuant to chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, that same warehouseman may obtain a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit as surety for both chapter 2, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code. If a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written covering chapter 2, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, the bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall be made out in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and the seed indemnity fund. In the event a warehouseman fails as defined in section 69-202(8), Idaho Code, and a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and seed indemnity fund, the proceeds of the bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit will be allocated based on the dollar amount of the verified claims approved pursuant to chapter 2, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code.

      While an original receipt issued under this chapter is outstanding and uncanceled by the warehouseman issuing the same no other or further receipt shall be issued for the agricultural commodity covered thereby or for any part thereof. In order to issue a new warehouse receipt supplementing one that has been lost or destroyed or to cancel an outstanding warehouse receipt that has been lost or destroyed, the licensed warehouseman shall require the depositor or other applicant to submit to the warehouseman: (1) an affidavit stating that he is lawfully entitled to possession of the original receipt, that he has not negotiated or assigned it and how the original receipt was lost or destroyed, and (2) a bond in an amount double the market value of the agricultural commodity represented by the lost or destroyed receipt. The market value shall be determined at the time this bond is submitted for the lost receipt. A warehouse receipt issued in lieu of a lost or destroyed receipt shall duplicate the original and bear a statement that it is issued in lieu of the lost or destroyed receipt. A duplicate receipt must clearly state on its face that it is a duplicate receipt, the number of the receipt it is replacing and the license number under which the original receipt was issued.

     <p>
      When partial withdrawal of an agricultural commodity is made by a depositor, the warehouseman shall make appropriate notation thereof on the depositor’s nonnegotiable receipt or on other records. If the warehouseman has issued a negotiable receipt to the depositor he shall claim, cancel, and replace it with a negotiable receipt showing the amount of the depositor’s agricultural commodity remaining in the warehouse. For failure to claim and cancel a negotiable receipt which has been issued by him, a warehouseman shall be liable to anyone who purchases such receipt for value and in good faith, for failure to deliver all the agricultural commodity specified in the receipt, whether such purchaser acquired title to the negotiable receipt before or after delivery of any part of the agricultural commodity by the warehouseman.

A delivery of commodity between producers, none of which are commodity dealers or warehousemen, is exempt from the collection and payment of assessment. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of the commodity indemnity fund. Disbursements shall be on authorization of the director. No appropriation is required for disbursements from this fund.

In the event the accrued interest is insufficient to pay the necessary expenses and costs of administering the fund in any particular year, then accrued interest shall first be applied to those costs and expenses. The remaining costs and expenses will be paid with principal from the commodity indemnity fund. In no event, however, shall payments from principal in any given year exceed the sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). The interest accumulated by the fund may be paid to the department and to the state treasurer to defray costs of administering the warehouse and dealer program and the commodity indemnity fund. The interest accumulated by the fund and, if necessary, a portion of the fund, may be used to defray the cost of reinsuring the fund at the discretion of the director. The state of Idaho shall not be liable for any claims presented against the fund.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The minimum balance in the commodity indemnity fund, which shall be used exclusively for purposes of paying claimants pursuant to this chapter and chapter 5, title 69, Idaho Code, shall be two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). At no time shall the balance be allowed to fall below the minimum balance. The director may pay claims, on a pro rata basis if necessary, until the minimum balance is reached. If the director cannot fully pay a claim before the minimum balance is reached, he shall, when the commodity indemnity fund contains sufficient funds, pay off the claim. After three (3) years from the date a claim is approved, the fund shall not be liable for any unpaid amounts.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Amounts paid from the commodity indemnity fund in satisfaction of any approved claim shall constitute a debt and obligation of the warehouseman, dealer, or surety against whom the claim was made. The director may bring suit on behalf of the commodity indemnity fund in the district court of Ada county to recover from the warehouseman, dealer, or surety the amount of the payment made from the commodity indemnity fund, together with costs and attorney’s fees incurred in maintaining the suit. In the event the department initiates an action against a warehouseman, dealer, or surety the department’s claim is deemed to accrue and relate back to the time that each producer who received a commodity indemnity fund payment incurred a loss in the facility. In no event shall a commodity indemnity fund payment be deemed to be beyond the reimbursement from the warehouseman, dealer, or surety merely because the payment may have occurred after the facility closed. Any recovery for reimbursement to the fund shall bear interest at the statutory rate from the date of failure.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as provided in chapter 2, title 69, Idaho Code, an applicant for a license to operate as a commodity dealer shall, before a license will be issued, file with the department a bond in favor of the commodity indemnity fund with a corporate surety approved by the department with the condition that the applicant will pay the purchase price of any agricultural commodity to the seller. The aggregate annual liability of the surety shall in no event exceed the sum of the bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the discretion of the director, any person required to submit a bond to the department in accordance with this chapter, may give to the department a certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit payable to the commodity indemnity fund in lieu of the bond required herein. The principal amount of the certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall be the same as that required for a surety bond pursuant to this chapter. Accrued interest upon the certificate of deposit shall be payable to the purchaser of the certificate. The certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall remain on file with the department until it is released, canceled or discharged by the director. The provisions of this chapter that apply to a bond required pursuant to this chapter apply to each certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit given in lieu of such bond. The certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall remain on file with the department until it is released, canceled, or discharged by the director, or until the director is notified ninety (90) days in advance, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, that the certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is renewed, canceled or amended. Failure to notify the director may result in the suspension or revocation of the commodity dealer’s license. Under the provisions of this chapter, an irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit shall not be accepted unless it is issued by a national bank or federal thrift institution in Idaho or by a state-chartered bank or thrift institution authorized to conduct business in Idaho and insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation. A certificate of deposit shall be submitted with an audited or reviewed financial statement prepared in accordance with the rules of the department by an independent Idaho certified public accountant or Idaho licensed public accountant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount of bond to be furnished for each commodity dealer shall be fixed at whichever of the following amounts is greater:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t69c05s69-506ol11">
       The combined total indebtedness paid and owed to producers for agricultural commodity and seed crop for the previous license year; or
      </li>
      <li id="t69c05s69-506ol12">
       The indebtedness owed and estimated to be owed to producers for agricultural commodity and seed crop for the current license year.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Subsequent to determining whichever of the preceding amounts is greater, and based on that amount, the amount of bond shall be calculated as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Gross Dollars:      Amount of Bond:
     </p>
     <p>
      $0 - $450,000      $20,000 bond or 6% of the gross
     </p>
     <p>
      dollars, whichever is less
     </p>
     <p>
      $450,001 - $1,000,000      $40,000 bond
    $1,000,001 - $8,000,000      $100,000 bond
     </p>
     <p>
      Over $8,000,000      $500,000 bond
     </p>
     <p>
      In any case, the amount of the bond shall not be more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000). A surety shall notify the commodity dealer and the department by certified mail at least ninety (90) days prior to the cancellation of a bond issued under the provisions of this chapter. The liability of the surety shall cover purchases made by the commodity dealer during the time the bond is in force. A commodity dealer’s bond filed with this department shall be continuous until canceled by the surety upon ninety (90) days’ notice. The director reserves the right to waive the ninety (90) day cancellation period.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a commodity dealer is licensed pursuant to chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, that same commodity dealer may obtain a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit as a surety under chapter 5, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code. If a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written covering chapter 5, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, the bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall be made out in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and the seed indemnity fund. In the event a commodity dealer fails as defined in section 69-202(8), Idaho Code, and a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and seed indemnity fund, the proceeds of the bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit will be allocated based on the dollar amount of the verified claims approved pursuant to chapter 2 [5], title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The director may, upon his own motion, whenever he has reason to believe the provisions of this chapter have been violated, or upon verified complaint of any person in writing, investigate the actions of any commodity dealer licensed under the provisions of this chapter, and if he finds probable cause to do so, shall file a complaint against said commodity dealer which shall be set down for hearing before the director upon thirty (30) days’ notice served upon such license holder either by personal service, registered mail or facsimile prior to such hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director shall have the power to administer oaths, certify to all official acts and shall have the power to subpoena any person in this state as a witness, to compel through subpoena the production of books, papers and records, and to take the testimony of any person on deposition in the same manner as is prescribed by law in the procedure before the courts of this state. A subpoena issued by the director shall extend to all parts of the state and may be served by any person authorized to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      All powers of the director herein enumerated in respect to administering oaths, power of subpoena, and other enumerated powers in hearings on complaints shall likewise be applicable to hearings held on applications for the issuance or renewal of a commodity dealer’s license.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the director or his authorized representative to report for prosecution or to institute civil, criminal or administrative action against a commodity dealer for a violation of the provisions of this chapter when he believes that public interest will best be served by a suitable warning or other administrative action. The director shall maintain a record of any administrative action involving a commodity dealer with that commodity dealer’s license file.

     <p>
      Any producer injured by the breach of any obligation for which a bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written, under the provisions of section 69-506, Idaho Code, must petition the director to make demand upon the commodity dealer, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or bond. The director may thereupon make demand for payment of such damages and in the event such damages are not promptly paid the director may commence an action to enforce payment of such damages. The liability of the bank on a certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit, and the surety upon the bond required to be given by a commodity dealer as provided by section 69-506, Idaho Code, for any one (1) annual licensing period shall be limited to the amount specified in the bond, certificate of deposit, or irrevocable letter of credit and in case of recoveries had by two (2) or more producers for violation of the conditions of this chapter in excess of the amount of the bond, certificate of deposit, or irrevocable letter of credit, such recovery shall be prorated and the total recovery for any one (1) annual licensing period shall not exceed the amount of the bond, certificate of deposit, or irrevocable letter of credit. In the event the director sues and obtains a judgment against the commodity dealer and/or his surety or bank for payment of such damages under this chapter, he shall be entitled to recover a reasonable attorney’s fee.

        The fact that bond had been cancelled did not terminate surety’s liabilities under the provisions of former similar section since surety would be liable for any unsettled obligations incurred by principal during the life of the bond.

        Where surety, under collateral agreements, had right to retain collateral until principal’s liability ceased and surety retained the right to demand the type of evidence to be furnished to establish the lack of any liability on its part for principal’s activities during the period of the bond’s life, the offer by principal to submit evidence that its customers had been paid, together with affidavits to that effect from all its customers with whom it had done business for the last two years was insufficient to establish lack of liability and surety was not guilty of conversion by retaining collateral.
