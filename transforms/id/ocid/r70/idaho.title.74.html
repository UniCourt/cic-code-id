        The legislature intended the definition of “public record” to be broad enough to include a list of names obtained by an agency in the normal course of carrying out its duties; in addition, the language of this section clearly evidenced an intent by the legislature to create a very broad scope of government records and information accessible to the public. Thus, a list of names of dairy product producers who paid the taxes levied by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.25.html#t25c31s25-3117" target="_blank">§ 25-3117</a></cite>, which list was compiled by the Idaho dairy products commission, fell within the purview of such “public records and other matters,” and was subject to inspection by a private citizen.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol11">
       Every person has a right to examine and take a copy of any public record of this state and there is a presumption that all public records in Idaho are open at all reasonable times for inspection except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol12">
       The right to copy public records shall include the right to make photographs or photographic or other copies while the records are in the possession of the custodian of the records using equipment provided by the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic or using equipment designated by the custodian.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol13">
       Additionally, the custodian of any public record shall give the person, on demand, a certified copy of it if the record is of a nature permitting such copying or shall furnish reasonable opportunity to inspect or copy such record.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol14">
       A public agency or independent public body corporate and politic may require that a request for public records be submitted to it in a writing that specifically describes the subject matter and records sought, including a specific date range for when the records sought were created. The requesting party shall be as specific as possible when requesting records. A request shall describe records sought in sufficient detail to enable the public body to locate such records with reasonable effort. A request shall also provide the requester’s name, mailing address, e-mail address and telephone number. A request for public records and delivery of the public records may be made by electronic mail.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol15">
       The custodian shall make no inquiry of any person who requests a public record, except:

         For providing a duplicate of a computer tape, computer disc, microfilm or similar or analogous record system containing public record information, a public agency or independent public body corporate and politic or public official may charge a fee, uniform to all persons that does not exceed the sum of the following:
        </li>
        <li id="t74c01s74-102ol15e">
         Fees shall not exceed reasonable labor costs necessarily incurred in responding to a public records request. Fees, if charged, shall reflect the personnel and quantity of time that are reasonably necessary to process a request. Fees for labor costs shall be charged at the per hour pay rate of the lowest paid administrative staff employee or public official of the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic who is necessary and qualified to process the request. If a request requires redactions to be made by an attorney who is employed by the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic, the rate charged shall be no more than the per hour rate of the lowest paid attorney within the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic who is necessary and qualified to process the public records request. If a request is submitted to a public agency or independent public body corporate and politic that does not have an attorney on staff, and requires redactions by an attorney, the rate shall be no more than the usual and customary rate of the attorney who is retained by the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic for that purpose.

        <li id="t74c01s74-102ol15f">
         The public agency or independent public body corporate and politic shall not charge any cost or fee for copies or labor when the requester demonstrates that the requester’s examination and/or copying of public records:

      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol17">
       Nothing herein contained shall prevent the custodian from maintaining such vigilance as is required to prevent alteration of any public record while it is being examined.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol18">
       Examination of public records under the authority of this section must be conducted during regular office or working hours unless the custodian shall authorize examination of records in other than regular office or working hours. In this event, the persons designated to represent the custodian during such examination shall be entitled to reasonable compensation to be paid to them by the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic having custody of such records, out of funds provided in advance by the person examining such records, at other than regular office or working hours.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c01s74-102ol19">
       The public agency or independent public body corporate and politic may provide the requester information to help the requester narrow the scope of the request or to help the requester make the request more specific when the response to the request is likely to be voluminous or require payment as provided in subsection (10) of this section.
    (10)(a) Except for fees that are authorized or prescribed under other provisions of Idaho law, no fee shall be charged for the first two (2) hours of labor in responding to a request for public records, or for copying the first one hundred (100) pages of paper records that are requested.

    (g) Statements of fees by a public agency or independent public body corporate and politic shall be itemized to show the per page costs for copies, and hourly rates of employees and attorneys involved in responding to the request, and the actual time spent on the public records request. No lump sum costs shall be assigned to any public records request.

      (c) A public agency or independent public body corporate and politic or public official may establish a copying fee schedule. The fee may not exceed the actual cost to the agency of copying the record if another fee is not otherwise provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      (11) A requester may not file multiple requests for public records solely to avoid payment of fees. When a public agency or independent public body corporate and politic reasonably believes that one (1) or more requesters is segregating a request into a series of requests to avoid payment of fees authorized pursuant to this section, the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic may aggregate such requests and charge the appropriate fees. The public agency or independent public body corporate and politic may consider the time period in which the requests have been made in its determination to aggregate the related requests. A public agency or independent public body corporate and politic shall not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one (1) requester.
     </p>
     <p>
      (12) The custodian may require advance payment of fees authorized by this section. Any money received by the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic shall be credited to the account for which the expense being reimbursed was or will be charged, and such funds may be expended by the agency as part of its appropriation from that fund. Any portion of an advance payment in excess of the actual costs of labor and copying incurred by the agency in responding to the request shall be returned to the requester.
     </p>
     <p>
      (13) A public agency or independent public body corporate and politic shall not prevent the examination or copying of a public record by contracting with a nongovernmental body to perform any of its duties or functions.
     </p>
     <p>
      (14) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency or independent public body corporate and politic from disclosing statistical information that is descriptive of an identifiable person or persons, unless prohibited by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      (15) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency or independent public body corporate and politic from providing a copy of a public record in electronic form if the record is available in electronic form and if the person specifically requests an electronic copy.
     </p>
     <p>
      (16) A public agency, elected official or independent public body corporate and politic shall designate a custodian or custodians for all public records, which includes any public official having custody of, control of, or authorized access to public records and also includes all delegates of such officials, employees or representatives.

        The 2020 amendment, by ch. 338, rewrote subsection (4), which formerly read: “A public agency or independent public body corporate and politic may require that a request for public records be submitted to it in a writing that provides the requester’s name, mailing address, e-mail address and telephone number.

The term was retained in this section in the revision of the code sections relating to public records by S.L. 2015, chapter 140, which enacted all of title 74, Idaho Code.

       <p>
        Because of the presumption of this section that all public records are open unless expressly otherwise, since the administrative review of a shooting incident involving Boise police officers prepared by a police lieutenant was not a personnel record, personnel information, or a personnel evaluation, and because all of the information that would have constituted an invasion of the officers’ privacy was contained in the investigation report which had been disclosed pursuant to a court order, the administrative review was not exempt from disclosure; city was required to disclose administrative review upon request of publisher.

        Identification of a custodian has no bearing on whether documents are exempt from disclosure; therefore, it was irrelevant whether the Idaho state department of agriculture was the custodian of nutrition management plans or not in the determination of whether or not they were exempt from disclosure to a conservation league.

        District court engages in the same analysis as the custodian when determining whether or not the records are exempt from disclosure. Thus, both the district court and the public agency in custody of the requested record have a duty to examine the documents subject to the request and separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination. This obligation exists even if exempt material is contained in the same public record as nonexempt material. Wade v. Taylor, 156 Idaho 91, 320 P.3d 1250 (2014).

        Because former laws providing for the inspection of public records by private citizens were mandatory, there were no exceptions to the rule of disclosure and the courts could not apply a balancing test to determine whether or not to allow disclosure.

        The Idaho dairy products commission’s duty, power and authority to take such action as the commission deemed necessary or advisable in order to stabilize and protect the dairy industry of the state and the health and welfare of the public was clearly limited by the legislature’s express statutory language in former section mandating that the public records and other matters be open to the inspection of the public; accordingly, the commission’s list of dairy product producers, who paid the taxes levied by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.25.html#t25c31s25-3117" target="_blank">§ 25-3117 </a></cite>to dairy product dealers, was subject to disclosure, even though the dealer gave the names of the producers to the commission in confidence.

        E-mail correspondence between a county employee and the county prosecutor were public records, and the public had a legitimate interest in these communications because the prosecutor defended the employee’s management of a county program when an investigation of the program’s finances was started by the board of county commissioners.

       <p>
        Even if the public is entitled to know the contents of a document when it has been filed, this entitlement does not necessarily extend to the physical handling of the document; to allow physical handling of an original document before it becomes an official record upon microfilming would carry a potential for abuse, because, if the document were altered or damaged, the public record would be affected; moreover, private rights or obligations could be put in doubt if an original document were altered or damaged after it was microfilmed but before it was returned to the proper party.

        Title company’s desire to avoid increases in fees charged by the recorder does not outweigh the recorder’s duty to protect the safety of documents entrusted to his care, nor does it diminish the recorder’s power to control the orderly function of his office, and, accordingly the recorder cannot be compelled to allow private photocopying of public records in the courthouse.

Provided however, if it is determined the existing electronic record requested will first have to be converted to another electronic format by the agency or by a third party and that such conversion cannot be completed within ten (10) working days, the agency shall so notify in writing the person requesting to examine or copy the records. The agency shall provide the converted public record at a time mutually agreed upon between the agency and the requester, with due consideration given to any limitations that may exist due to the process of conversion or due to the use of a third party to make the conversion.

The notice of denial or partial denial also shall indicate the statutory authority for the denial and indicate clearly the person’s right to appeal the denial or partial denial and the time periods for doing so.

        District court engages in the same analysis as a custodian when determining whether or not the records are exempt from disclosure. Thus, both the district court and the public agency in custody of the requested record have a duty to examine the documents subject to the request and separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination. This obligation exists even if exempt material is contained in the same public record as nonexempt material. Wade v. Taylor, 156 Idaho 91, 320 P.3d 1250 (2014).

The petition contesting the public agency’s or independent public body corporate and politic’s decision shall be filed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of mailing of the notice of denial or partial denial by the public agency or independent public body corporate and politic. In cases in which the records requested are claimed as exempt pursuant to section 74-107(1) or (24), Idaho Code, the petitioner shall be required to name as a party and serve the person or entity that filed or provided such documents to the agency, and such person or entity shall have standing to oppose the request for disclosure and to support the decision of the agency to deny the request. The time for responsive pleadings and for hearings in such proceedings shall be set by the court at the earliest possible time, or in no event beyond twenty-eight (28) calendar days from the date of filing.

        Even if a public agency is sold to a private entity, the agency has an affirmative duty to retain all records during the pendency of a petition to compel production of such records. A public agency shall keep all documents or records in question until the end of the appeal period, until a decision has been rendered on the petition, or as otherwise statutorily provided, whichever is longer. This duty is triggered at the time a petition is filed and continues until the petition is resolved, even if a legitimate sale is in the works. Ward v. Portneuf Med.

        District court engages in the same analysis as the custodian when determining whether or not the records are exempt from disclosure. Thus, both the district court and the public agency in custody of the requested record have a duty to examine the documents subject to the request and separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination. This obligation exists even if exempt material is contained in the same public record as nonexempt material. Wade v. Taylor, 156 Idaho 91, 320 P.3d 1250 (2014).

The court shall decide the case after examining the record in camera, papers filed by the parties, and such oral argument and additional evidence as the court may allow.

       <p>
        In the context of exemption from disclosure of investigatory records, under subsection (2) of this section, the definition of “law enforcement agency” specifically includes the Idaho office of the attorney general, and the definition of “investigatory records” is not limited to the confines of an agency’s law enforcement authority; thus, individual’s request directed at gaining access to records that might disclose whether the attorney general was conducting an investigation of him was properly denied.

        Trial court properly affirmed defendant county’s refusal of plaintiffs’ request for certain public records; the documents at issue were exempt from disclosure as “investigatory records.” Gibson v. Ada County, 138 Idaho 787, 69 P.3d 1048 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where forms containing corrections officers’ personal information were disclosed to an inmate during criminal proceeding discovery, the invasion of privacy claims failed because: (1) the public defender and the inmate were entitled to the unredacted forms in order to authenticate them and defend against any restitution claim; (2) the information was an investigatory record and certain defendants were law enforcement agencies; (3) these records were exempt from public disclosure; and (4) none of the state defendants publicly disclosed private information. Nation v. State, 144 Idaho 177, 158 P.3d 953 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In refusing a request for disclosure of documents, the withholding agency has the burden to demonstrate a reasonable probability that disclosure of the requested records would result in a harm listed at the time of the denial of the public records request rather than at the time of the hearing. Wade v. Taylor, 156 Idaho 91, 320 P.3d 1250 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in concluding that investigatory records were inactive because, although the police had completed its investigation into the matter, the county prosecuting attorney’s office was still contemplating prosecution of either the applicant or an officer and was evaluating the information compiled by police; investigatory records under active prosecutorial review are not inactive investigatory records, but are active investigatory records, requiring the application of subsection (1) Wade v. Taylor, 156 Idaho 91, 320 P.3d 1250 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (1) applies to investigatory records generally, while subsection (3) deals with inactive investigatory records, indicating there is a distinction between active and inactive investigatory records. The legislative intent underlying the section is to prevent the premature disclosure of information that may compromise an investigation, the state’s case in court, or the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Wade v. Taylor, 156 Idaho 91, 320 P.3d 1250 (2014).
    Burden of demonstrating that disclosure of the records would result in a harm identified by paragraphs (a) to (f) in subsection (1), is the same for each subdivision. The district court is to make this determination in light of the record before it, not based on a generalization of the types of documents withheld, but by a thorough review of the investigatory record and consideration of the likelihood that the harms identified will be realized. Wade v. Taylor, 156 Idaho 91, 320 P.3d 1250 (2014).

        District court erred by denying the state’s motion to admit into evidence at trial a transcript of the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness unavailable to testify at trial, because the district court’s finding that defendant did not know that the witness was a confidential informant was not supported by substantial and competent evidence. State v. Richardson, 156 Idaho 524, 328 P.3d 504 (2014).

        Defendant failed to demonstrate, and the court could not see, how this section and Idaho Evid. R. 804(b)(1) were inconsistent. Both allow the use at trial of the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who, at the time of trial, is shown to be unavailable. Moreover, the statute is consistent with the inherent policy of Idaho Evid. R. 402. State v. Ricks, 122 Idaho 856, 840 P.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1992).
    To the extent that Idaho Evid. R. 804(b)(1) places greater strictures upon the use of evidence than does this section, the rule must govern. State v. Ricks, 122 Idaho 856, 840 P.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1992).

        The “opportunity” requirement of Idaho Evid. R. 804(b)(1) is no different from the same requirement in this section. State v. Ricks, 122 Idaho 856, 840 P.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no indication in the record that counsel’s opportunity to cross-examine was curtailed in any way by the magistrate, and whether counsel chose to utilize that opportunity fully was more a matter of tactics or strategy than opportunity, district court did not err in deciding that defendant’s counsel had an opportunity to develop the testimony by cross-examination at the preliminary hearing. State v. Ricks, 122 Idaho 856, 840 P.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1992).

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in admitting testimony of witness into evidence through the preliminary hearing transcript where there was no other evidence to support charge of grand theft of certain materials except the testimony of this witness, where the testimony was more probative on the point it was offered than any other evidence which could have been procured through reasonable efforts where substantial efforts were made to locate the witness but such efforts were unsuccessful and where defendant’s counsel during the preliminary hearing cross-examined the witness and where the motive for preliminary hearing cross-examination was similar to the motive she had during the trial as required by Idaho Evid. R. 804(b)(1). State v. Owen, 129 Idaho 920, 935 P.2d 183 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in finding a witness unavailable and his preliminary hearing testimony admissible where the state failed to use diligent and good faith efforts to locate and secure a witness’ attendance at trial since, after mailing a subpoena to the witness and receiving the receipt, the prosecution lost track of him, and made no effort to use the procedure set forth in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c30s19-3005" target="_blank">§ 19-3005</a></cite>(2) to secure the attendance of the witness.

       <p>
        Defendant, who was a convenience store worker, was accused of grand theft; a witness who had the shift after defendant’s, and who discovered money was missing, was slated to testify; however, she was terminally ill and relapsed during the trial. The trial court erred in deciding that the witness was unavailable and in allowing the witness’s preliminary hearing testimony to be admitted because there was insubstantial evidence to support the finding that the witness was unavailable; however, the trial court’s error was harmless in light of the other evidence that was presented against defendant. State v. Perry, 144 Idaho 266, 159 P.3d 903 (Ct. App. 2007). — Admissibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The court could not adopt a per se rule that preliminary hearing testimony is inadmissible in light of the explicit statement of policy in this section and the implicit statement of policy in Idaho Evid. R. 402 and 804(b)(1). A case-by-case approach is the better way to determine whether the district court was correct in ruling that the preliminary hearing testimony was admissible. Such an approach would allow the trial court to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the party opposing the use of such testimony had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination. State v. Ricks, 122 Idaho 856, 840 P.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court determines whether party opposing use of preliminary hearing testimony had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination, and where such findings are challenged on appeal the court of appeals will apply the “clear error” standard of review. If the factual predicates of Idaho Evid. R. 804 are met, and if there are no other reasons shown under the rules for its exclusion, the court may admit the evidence at trial. State v. Ricks, 122 Idaho 856, 840 P.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in ruling that the jailed witness who refused to testify was in fact an unavailable witness without first bringing him back into court and ordering him to testify under the direct threat of contempt; therefore, the witness was not an unavailable witness as referenced in subdivision 2, and the admission of his preliminary hearing testimony was error. State v. Barcella, 135 Idaho 191, 16 P.3d 288 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an aggravated assault case where the victim testified in a preliminary hearing but died before trial, defendant’s confrontation right was not violated by admission of that testimony at trial. Defendant was represented at the preliminary hearing by counsel who engaged the victim in full and effective cross-examination as to his truthfulness, bias, memory, and motive. State v. Mantz, 148 Idaho 303, 222 P.3d 471 (Ct. App. 2009).

        The basis of defendant’s objection to the admission of preliminary hearing testimony, while not set forth specifically as required by Idaho Evid. R. 103(a)(1), appeared to be under this section, and the trial court’s ruling, therefore, would not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. State v. Cross, 132 Idaho 667, 978 P.2d 227 (1999).

        Where four private “work sessions” were held by the mayor and city council to discuss an annexation proposal prior to voting on the proposals at special public meetings, such work sessions were “meetings” under subsection (6) of this section, which had to be open to the public pursuant to subsection (1) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c23s67-2342" target="_blank">§ 67-2342 </a></cite>[now<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t74c02s74-203" target="_self">§ 74-203</a></cite>].

    Crop residue disposal program was not a subagency of the Idaho state department of agriculture (ISDA) within the meaning of the open meetings act (act), and the ISDA employees who worked in that program were not a governing body as defined by the act; therefore, the act did not apply to Idaho crop residue disposal program end-of-year meeting.

        When appellants sought an application to develop a subdivision in an area zoned rural that contained a wetland subject to flooding, the county board of commissioners’ visit to the site of the proposed subdivision was conducted in violation of provision of Idaho’s open meeting laws. While proper notice of the public hearing/site visit was provided, the board acted in bad faith by intentionally avoiding a group that was gathered near the entrance to the site location and precluding interested parties from actually attending.

     <ol>
      <li id="t74c02s74-204ol11">
       Regular meetings. No less than a five (5) calendar day meeting notice and a forty-eight (48) hour agenda notice shall be given unless otherwise provided by statute. Provided however, that any public agency that holds meetings at regular intervals of at least once per calendar month scheduled in advance over the course of the year may satisfy this meeting notice by giving meeting notices at least once each year of its regular meeting schedule. The notice requirement for meetings and agendas shall be satisfied by posting such notices and agendas in a prominent place at the principal office of the public agency or, if no such office exists, at the building where the meeting is to be held. The notice for meetings and agendas shall also be posted electronically if the entity maintains an online presence through a website or a social media platform.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c02s74-204ol12">
       Special meetings. No special meeting shall be held without at least a twenty-four (24) hour meeting and agenda notice, unless an emergency exists. An emergency is a situation involving injury or damage to persons or property, or immediate financial loss, or the likelihood of such injury, damage or loss, when the notice requirements of this section would make such notice impracticable or increase the likelihood or severity of such injury, damage or loss, and the reason for the emergency is stated at the outset of the meeting. The notice required under this section shall include at a minimum the meeting date, time, place and name of the public agency calling for the meeting. The secretary or other designee of each public agency shall maintain a list of the news media requesting notification of meetings and shall make a good faith effort to provide advance notification to them of the time and place of each meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c02s74-204ol13">
       Executive sessions. If only an executive session will be held, a twenty-four (24) hour meeting and agenda notice shall be given according to the notice provisions stated in subsection (2) of this section and shall state the reason and the specific provision of law authorizing the executive session.
      </li>
      <li id="t74c02s74-204ol14">
       An agenda shall be required for each meeting. The agenda shall be posted in the same manner as the notice of the meeting. An agenda may be amended, provided that a good faith effort is made to include, in the original agenda notice, all items known to be probable items of discussion. An agenda item that requires a vote shall be identified on the agenda as an “action item” to provide notice that action may be taken on that item. Identifying an item as an action item on the agenda does not require a vote to be taken on that item.
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t74c02s74-204ol14a">
         If an amendment to an agenda is made after an agenda has been posted but forty-eight (48) hours or more prior to the start of a regular meeting, or twenty-four (24) hours or more prior to the start of a special meeting, then the agenda is amended upon the posting of the amended agenda.
        </li>
        <li id="t74c02s74-204ol14b">
         If an amendment to an agenda is proposed after an agenda has been posted and less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to a regular meeting or less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to a special meeting but prior to the start of the meeting, the proposed amended agenda shall be posted but shall not become effective until a motion is made at the meeting and the governing body votes to amend the agenda.
    (c) An agenda may be amended after the start of a meeting upon a motion that states the reason for the amendment and states the good faith reason the agenda item was not included in the original agenda posting. Final action may not be taken on an agenda item added after the start of a meeting unless an emergency is declared necessitating action at that meeting. The declaration and justification shall be reflected in the minutes.

        There was no merit to the contention that the commission for the blind must have met before the public meeting and decided to fire the director and appoint her replacement, where the new appointee spoke several hours after the motion to terminate had been made and debated, and he qualified his remarks with the comment, “if the board does make the decision to retain.” Gardner v. Evans, 110 Idaho 925, 719 P.2d 1185, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1007, 107 S. Ct. 645, 93 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the letter of dismissal given to the director of the commission for the blind a very short time after the meeting terminated had “legal type wording” did not prove that the commission had decided to fire her before the public meeting.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a press release stating that the director had been dismissed was handed to the press before the commission for the blind had voted on her dismissal did not prove that the commission had decided to fire her before the public meeting where the press release was not attributable to the commission. Gardner v. Evans, 110 Idaho 925, 719 P.2d 1185, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1007, 107 S. Ct. 645, 93 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1986).

        The fact that a locksmith arrived several minutes after the meeting to fire the director of the commission for the blind and appoint her replacement had concluded, in order to change the lock on the door of the director’s office, was not substantial and competent proof that members of the commission met before the meeting and had an agreement to discharge the director.

        A discharged county employee, who argued he had been injured by this section permitting closed meetings of the board of county commissioners for personnel matters, failed to show that his right to equal protection had been infringed where the alleged injury to his reputation stemmed not from the closed meetings, the findings of fact or even the termination itself, but from supposed rumors and gossip aired outside any closed meeting.

        Executive session may be held: (1) to consider, and advise its legal representatives in, pending litigation; or (2) where there is a general public awareness of probable litigation. The Idaho legislature chose to rely on a “general public awareness” requirement, rather than an attorney presence requirement, to perform the gatekeeping function in such cases. Therefore, county commissioners were not required to have legal counsel present in a case where there was a general public awareness of probable litigation in a closed meeting between the commissioners and a city councilman, regarding tension between the two entities, and whether the state of the meeting qualified under paragraph (1)(f) was a disputed issue of fact not properly disposed of by a motion for judgment on the pleadings.

        This section was to become null and void, effective July 1, 2020, pursuant to S.L. 2015, ch. 271, § 4. However, S.L. 2019, ch. 85, § 2 repealed the provisions of S.L. 2015, ch. 271, § 4, effective July 1, 2019.
    Section 2 of S.L. 2015, chapter 271 purported to enact<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c23s67-2345A" target="_blank">§ 67-2345A</a></cite> to immediately follow<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c23s67-2345" target="_blank">§ 67-2345</a></cite>. However, S.L. 2015, chapter 140 repealed sections 67-2340 through 67-2347 and enacted new sections 74-201 through 74-208 that are identical to former sections 67-2340 through 67-2347.

The redesignation of this section, as enacted by S.L. 2015, ch. 271, was made permanent by S.L. 2016, ch. 47, § 41, effective July 1, 2016.

        There was no merit to the contention that the commission for the blind must have met before the public meeting and decided to fire the director and appoint her replacement, where the new appointee spoke several hours after the motion to terminate had been made and debated, and he qualified his remarks with the comment, “if the board does make the decision to retain.” Gardner v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the letter of dismissal given to the director of the commission for the blind a very short time after the meeting terminated had “legal type wording” did not prove that the commission had decided to fire her before the public meeting.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a press release stating that the director had been dismissed was handed to the press before the commission for the blind had voted on her dismissal did not prove that the commission had decided to fire her before the public meeting where the press release was not attributable to the commission.

       <p>
        This section specifies that an individual must act “knowingly,” so a participant must be aware that a meeting violated the open meeting law; knowledge of a violation may be inferred, but it is a prerequisite to liability. Therefore, judgment on the pleadings was inappropriate in a case where county commissioners contended that they did not know of a violation that occurred during a closed session with a city councilman. State v. Yzaguirre, 144 Idaho 471, 163 P.3d 1183 (2007).

        Ratification of Unauthorized Act by City Manager.

       <p>
        Fact that a city manager did not have authority to authorize the commencement of a lawsuit did not require dismissal where the city council later ratified that action in a meeting that complied with the open meeting laws, because there was nothing in the open meeting laws that would prevent a governing board from later ratifying an unauthorized act by its agent.

        If actions in violation of the open meeting laws were void without a challenge, the provisions of subsection (4) [now (6)] of this section would be meaningless; consequently, actions taken by commissioners in selecting landfill sites that were not challenged within the time provided for in subsection (4) of this section were not void under the open meeting laws. Petersen v. Franklin County, 130 Idaho 176, 938 P.2d 1214 (1997).

       § 74-404. Required action in conflicts.
      </h3>
      <p>
       A public official shall not take any official action or make a formal decision or formal recommendation concerning any matter where he has a conflict of interest and has failed to disclose such conflict as provided in this section. Disclosure of a conflict does not affect an elected public official’s authority to be counted for purposes of determining a quorum and to debate and to vote on the matter, unless the public official requests to be excused from debate and voting at his or her discretion. In order to determine whether a conflict of interest exists relative to any matter within the scope of the official functions of a public official, a public official may seek legal advice from the attorney representing that governmental entity or from the attorney general or from independent counsel. If the legal advice is that no real or potential conflict of interest exists, the public official may proceed and shall not be subject to the prohibitions of this chapter. If the legal advice is that a real or potential conflict may exist, the public official:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t74c04s74-404ol11">
        If he is an elected legislative public official, he shall disclose the nature of the potential conflict of interest and/or be subject to the rules of the body of which he/she is a member and shall take all action required under such rules prior to acting on the matter. If a member requests to be excused from voting on an issue which involves a conflict or a potential conflict, and the body of which he is a member does not excuse him, such failure to excuse shall exempt that member from any civil or criminal liability related to that particular issue.
       </li>
       <li id="t74c04s74-404ol12">
        If he is an elected state public official, he shall prepare a written statement describing the matter required to be acted upon and the nature of the potential conflict, and shall file such statement with the secretary of state prior to acting on the matter. A public official may seek legal advice from the attorney representing that agency or from the attorney general or from independent counsel. The elected public official may then act on the advice of the agency’s attorney, the attorney general or independent counsel.
       </li>
       <li id="t74c04s74-404ol13">
        If he is an appointed or employed state public official, he shall prepare a written statement describing the matter to be acted upon and the nature of the potential conflict, and shall deliver the statement to his appointing authority. The appointing authority may obtain an advisory opinion from the attorney general or from the attorney representing that agency. The public official may then act on the advice of the attorney general, the agency’s attorney or independent counsel.
       </li>
       <li id="t74c04s74-404ol14">
        If he is an elected public official of a county or municipality, he shall disclose the nature of a potential conflict of interest prior to acting on a matter and shall be subject to the rules of the body of which he/she is a member and take all action required by the rules prior to acting on the matter. If a member requests to be excused from voting on an issue which involves a conflict or a potential conflict, and the body of which he is a member does not excuse him, such failure to excuse shall exempt that member from any civil or criminal liability related to that particular issue. The public official may obtain an advisory opinion from the attorney general or the attorney for the county or municipality or from independent counsel. The public official may then act on the advice of the attorney general or attorney for the county or municipality or his independent counsel.
       </li>
       <li id="t74c04s74-404ol15">
        If he is an appointed or employed public official of a county or municipality, he shall prepare a written statement describing the matter required to be acted upon and the nature of the potential conflict, and shall deliver the statement to his appointing authority. The appointing authority may obtain an advisory opinion from the attorney for the appointing authority, or, if none, the attorney general. The public official may then act on the advice of the attorney general or attorney for the appointing authority or independent counsel.
