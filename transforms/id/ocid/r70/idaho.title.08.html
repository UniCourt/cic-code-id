        Where a chattel mortgage contains a stipulation providing that upon the happening of certain contingencies therein named, the mortgagee may take possession of said property and sell and dispose of it for the best price obtainable by due process of law, upon the happening of such contingency the mortgagee may maintain an action of claim and delivery to recover possession of the mortgaged property from an officer claiming to hold the same under an execution, who refuses to deliver up the property upon demand of the mortgagee or to pay the mortgage debt. Blackfoot City Bank v. Clements, 39 Idaho 194, 226 P. 1079 (1924); Schleiff v. McDonald, 41 Idaho 50, 237 P. 1108 (1925).

        The action of claim and delivery is essentially a possessory one and it should be brought in the name of the plaintiff, who is entitled to the possession, whether he is the holder of legal title or not; where the right of possession is separated from the legal title then the action must be maintained by the one lawfully entitled to the possession thereof.

      At any time prior to the hearing of the order to show cause, or before the delivery of the property to the plaintiff, the defendant may require the return thereof upon filing with the court a written undertaking executed by two (2) or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that they are bound in double the value of the property, as stated in the verified complaint or affidavit of the plaintiff or as determined by the court, for the delivery thereof to the plaintiff, if such delivery be ordered, and for the payment to him of such sum as may for any cause be recovered against the defendant. At the time of filing such undertaking, the defendant shall serve upon the plaintiff or his attorney and the sheriff, if such property shall then be in the custody of the sheriff, a notice of filing of such undertaking, to which a copy of such undertaking shall be attached, and shall cause proof of service thereof to be filed with the court. If such undertaking be filed prior to hearing of the order to show cause, proceedings thereunder shall terminate, unless exception is taken to such sureties. If, at the time of filing of such undertaking, the property shall be in the custody of the sheriff, such property shall be redelivered to the defendant five (5) days after service of notice of filing such undertaking upon the plaintiff or his attorney, unless exception is taken to such sureties.

        In action by purchaser to recover possession of tractor taken by seller where purchaser did not file undertaking for delivery but only an undertaking for costs and defendant filed undertaking for redelivery but left tractor in possession of sheriff, the defendant who obtained judgment for possession was not entitled to any damages for detention. Michael v. Zehm, 74 Idaho 442, 263 P.2d 990 (1953). When Remedy Inadequate.
       </p>
       <p>
        A writ of mandate, rather than claim and delivery, was the proper remedy to require defendants to return books and records to plaintiff corporations, since under this section defendant could have posted a redelivery bond and retained possession of the books and records, perhaps defeating furtherance of business of plaintiff corporations; additionally, where a writ of mandamus directs the restitution of property by corporate officer as performance of his duty, it is not necessary to describe such property with the particularity required in a replevin proceeding. Silver Bowl, Inc. v. Equity Metals, Inc., 93 Idaho 487, 464 P.2d 926 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since under this section the defendants would have been entitled to post a redelivery bond and retain possession of the corporate records even though the plaintiff had initiated a claim and delivery action, an action in mandamus, rather than an action in replevin, was proper. Nancy Lee Mines, Inc. v. Harrison, 93 Idaho 652, 471 P.2d 39 (1970).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The qualification of sureties under any written undertaking referred to in this chapter shall be such as are prescribed by this code, in respect to bail upon an order of civil arrest. Either party may, within two (2) days after service of an undertaking or notice of filing an undertaking under the provisions of this chapter, give written notice to the court, the other party and the sheriff that he excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. If he fails to do so, he is deemed to have waived all objections to them. When a party excepts, the other party’s sureties shall justify on notice within not less than two (2) nor more than five (5) days, in like manner as upon bail in civil arrest. If the property be in the custody of the sheriff, he shall retain custody thereof until the justification is completed or waived or fails. If the sureties fail to justify, the sheriff shall proceed as if no such undertaking had been filed. If the sureties justify or the exception is waived, he shall deliver the property to the party filing such undertaking.

    Where defendants did not adduce any evidence as regards their alleged expense in obtaining the replevin bond necessary in their being repossessed of tractor allegedly wrongfully taken from them by sheriff, the trial court did not err in removing such issue from the jury, such recovery being precluded by their action.

        Where claim, as set out in complaint, was one based on the covenant contained in the warranty deed delivered by former owner and is an action upon “contract express or implied,” this claim is within the contemplation of this section requiring that the action be “for the direct payment of money.” Bannock Title Co. v.

        The contract of an indorser of a promissory note or guarantor of a bill of exchange is a contract “for the direct payment of money,” and an attachment may issue against property of such indorser or guarantor when action is brought to enforce payment of debt, the same as against acceptor or maker. Armstrong v. Slick, 14 Idaho 208, 93 P. 775 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute provides in what actions an attachment may issue. If and if complaint discloses that action is not such, and attachment is issued, then it was improperly issued, and upon proper motion it will be dissolved. Ross v. Gold Ridge Mining Co., 14 Idaho 687, 95 P. 821 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action upon express contract for payment of money, plaintiff is entitled to have property attached and cannot be held in damages unless same was wrongful within meaning of statute. Taylor v. Fluharty, 35 Idaho 705, 208 P. 866 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        In absence of express statutory provision, attachment will not lie on demands existing ex delicto; it is immaterial that same measure of damages might be applied as would govern in case of breach of contract. Sunderlin v. Warner, 42 Idaho 479, 246 P. 1 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        A negotiable promissory note is a contract for direct payment of money and this characteristic is not destroyed by provision for reasonable attorney’s fee in case of suit or action. It still remains an unconditional promise for the direct payment of money. Twin Falls Nat’l Bank v. Reed, 44 Idaho 573, 258 P. 526 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the circuit court of appeals had granted a decree enforcing back pay against an employer, on petition of the national labor relations board, it would restrain estranged wives and creditors of the employees entitled to the back pay from maintaining actions in the state court for the purpose of carrying into effect attachment writs and injunctive orders against the employer for the purpose of reaching the back pay, since the power to punish for contempt was not an adequate safeguard. NLRB v. Sunshine Mining Co., 125 F.2d 757 (9th Cir. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where money is advanced on the purchase price of goods, and the seller fails or refuses to deliver, a suit to recover the money advanced is an implied contract for the direct payment of money permitting the issuance of an attachment. B. J. Carney & Co. v. Murphy, 68 Idaho 376, 195 P.2d 339 (1948).
    An action for a balance due on an open, mutual and current account permits an attachment, there being an implied contract to pay the indebtedness. B. J. Carney & Co. v. Murphy, 68 Idaho 376, 195 P.2d 339 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the complaint, by any reasonable intendment, discloses an action upon contract, express or implied, for the direct payment of money, the writ of attachment was properly issued. B. J. Carney & Co. v. Murphy, 68 Idaho 376, 195 P.2d 339 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where complaint by affiant sought to recover amount paid non-resident in drilling of well on the ground of fraudulent representations by non-resident, attachment would lie since action was based on implied promise to repay expense as result of fraud, hence action was ex contractu.

        An order drawn by defendant on his debtor, accepted by latter and placed in the hands of the creditor to secure the debt is such pledge of personal property as to preclude an attachment. Murphy v. Montandon, 3 Idaho 325, 29 P. 851 (1892).

        Where W sold to F certain real estate upon executory contract, F going into possession, but title remaining in W until purchase-price is paid, W has such a lien as bars him from resorting to attachment for the recovery of the unpaid portion of the purchase-price.

       </p>
       <p>
        A reservation of title in vendor in a conditional sale contract until payment of the purchase price constitutes such a lien as precludes vendor from obtaining an attachment in an action to recover the unpaid portion of the purchase price.

        Conclusion of court was that the contract to sell real and personal property of a ranch and the farming machinery and equipment was an executory contract of sale under the terms of which appellants retained title as security for the payment of the purchase price and, this being so, the contract was one expressly providing for security within the meaning of this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c05s8-502" target="_blank">§ 8-502</a></cite>, and the attachment was properly discharged.

       Upon the hearing on the order to show cause, the court shall consider the showing made by the parties appearing, and shall make a preliminary determination of whether there is a reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in its claim. If the court makes this determination favorably to the plaintiff, it shall, upon examination of the evidence or testimony submitted and such other evidence or testimony as the judge may thereupon[,] require, determine the proper amount to be specified in the undertaking required by section 8-503, Idaho Code, and if requested, the value of any property sought to be retained by or returned to defendant and the proper amount to be specified in any undertaking which may be or has been filed by defendant pursuant to section 8-506C, Idaho Code. If the court determines that the action is one in which a writ of attachment should issue, it shall direct the issuance of such writ. The court may direct the order in which the writ shall be levied upon different assets of the defendant, if, in the aggregate, they exceed in value an amount clearly adequate to secure any judgment which may be recovered by the plaintiff.

        Defects in an affidavit for attachment against a nonresident who is not personally served with process go to the jurisdiction of the court and preclude entry of a valid judgment in the action. Kerns v. McAulay, 8 Idaho 558, 69 P. 539 (1902).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where an amended affidavit for attachment showed that the original affidavit on which the attachment was issued was false in representing that the payment of the debt sued on had not been secured by a mortgage, in absence of a showing that the false statement in the original affidavit was made innocently, the trial judge was not bound to accept as true the amended affidavit stating that the security which had been given had become valueless.

       <p>
        Trial court correctly denied appellants’ motion to strike respondent’s amended affidavit for attachment, made by its treasurer on its behalf and in affirmative terms, not upon information and belief; no hearing having been held on appellants’ amended motion to dissolve attachment when the amended affidavit was filed, it was sufficient and timely. Salt Lake Hdwe. Co. v. Steffler, 87 Idaho 383, 393 P.2d 607 (1964). Averment as to Security.
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of an affidavit for attachment to state that debt sued upon is not secured by “any pledge of personal property” does not render attachment ineffective or void when it does allege that same has not been secured by any mortgage or lien on real or personal property; lien includes “pledge.” Glidden v. Whittier, 46 F. 437 (C.C.D. Idaho 1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party who holds a secured claim against another cannot secure the benefit of the attachment law therefor by procuring an assignment of small unsecured claims and writing such claims in same complaint with secured claims. Willman v. Friedman, 3 Idaho 734, 35 P. 37 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        When debt is secured by mortgage, attachment affidavit in a suit to recover debt must allege that the mortgage was given and that same has become valueless without any act of plaintiff; if it falsely states that debt is unsecured, the attachment should be dissolved on motion, although it is shown that security has become valueless. Vollmer v. Spencer, 5 Idaho 557, 51 P. 609 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the affidavit partially follows the language of the statute in regard to debt not being secured, but fails to state that it is not secured by “pledge of personal property,” and contains no statement equivalent to that, the affidavit is not sufficient. Knutsen v. Phillips, 16 Idaho 267, 101 P. 596 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit must negative every form of security mentioned in statute. Farmers State Bank v. Gray, 36 Idaho 49, 210 P. 1006 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit should set out specifically that indebtedness sued on has not been secured “by any mortgage or lien upon real or personal property or by any pledge of personal property,” or words to that effect. Farmers State Bank v. Gray, 36 Idaho 49, 210 P. 1006 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute provides for affidavit in two classes of cases: (1) Where debt has not been secured, which fact should be stated in affidavit; (2) where debt has been secured but security has become valueless; in latter case it is not necessary that affidavit should state that debt has not been secured, but only that security originally given has become valueless without fault of plaintiff. Farmers State Bank v. Gray, 36 Idaho 49, 210 P. 1006 (1922); Mitchell v. Ada Inv. Co., 42 Idaho 421, 246 P. 10 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it appears that debt which is subject of action was secured within meaning of this section at time affidavit was made, writ should be dismissed. Hill v. Bennett, 37 Idaho 161, 215 P. 471 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where affidavit for attachment alleges that debt sued upon had not been secured by any of the specific kinds of security designated in this section, a joint checking account of plaintiff and defendant does not constitute such security as to bar the action. Citizens Auto. Inter-Ins. Exch. v. Andrus, 70 Idaho 114, 212 P.2d 406 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion of court was that the contract to sell real and personal property of a ranch and the farming machinery and equipment was an executory contract of sale under the terms of which appellants retained title as security for the payment of the purchase price and this being so the contract was one expressly providing for security within the meaning of this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c05s8-501" target="_blank">§ 8-501</a></cite>, and the attachment was properly discharged. Heinrich v. Barlow, 87 Idaho 72, 390 P.2d 831 (1964).
    The claim must be one founded upon a contract for the direct payment of money, the payment of which has not been secured in any degree by any of the means specified in the statute. If it has been secured, however inadequately, attachment cannot issue unless such security has, without any act of the plaintiff or the person to whom the security was issued, become valueless. Heinrich v. Barlow, 87 Idaho 72, 390 P.2d 831 (1964).

       <p>
        Where the bank’s affidavit did not establish probable cause and the in-chambers conversation with the bank’s counsel was unrecorded, the record reflected nothing from which the court could determine that the statutory requirements were met at the time the writ was issued; thus, the writ should not have been issued, and the attachment was therefore wrongful.

       <p>
        Subdivision (c)(3) of this section requires that the danger of damage to or impairment of the property be established by “specific facts”; mere conclusions that some danger exists are inadequate. Valley Bank v. Dalton, 110 Idaho 87, 714 P.2d 56 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The affidavit of the bank did not indicate the vehicles were in immediate danger of removal, destruction, sale, or concealment, nor did it give any specific facts indicating that the owners were threatening to remove, destroy, sell, or conceal the vehicles; therefore, the affidavit alone did not justify attachment of the vehicles. Valley Bank v. Dalton, 110 Idaho 87, 714 P.2d 56 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the owners had deposited checks which were drawn on an account with insufficient funds and then failed to remedy the situation did not indicate danger to the vehicles; therefore, these allegations in the complaint, incorporated by reference in the bank’s affidavit, did not state a basis for issuance of a writ of attachment to seize the owners’ vehicles.

        In attachment proceeding against nonresident, the affidavit does not have to show the lack or failure or valuelessness of any security. Wallace v. Perry, 74 Idaho 86, 257 P.2d 231 (1953).

Skillern v. Ward, 79 Idaho 350, 317 P.2d 1050 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Idaho statutes authorized substitute service in an action against a non-resident for debt, and service being essential to the maintenance of such an action, the court did not err in denying the motion to quash service of summons secured by substitute service on a nonresident husband in an action by divorced wife to recover past due installments of child support on the ground that the action was not in rem.

        Security Becoming Valueless.

       <p>
        Simple statement that security has become worthless is insufficient without further statement that it became so “without any act of the plaintiff, or the person to whom the security was given.” Bellevue State Bank v. Lilya, 35 Idaho 270, 205 P. 893 (1922); Bear Lake State Bank v. Wilcox, 48 Idaho 147, 279 P. 1090 (1929).

       <p>
        By foreclosure sale, property becomes valueless as security. Theory appears to be that exhaustion of security by foreclosure is by writ of law and through authority of mortgagor or pledgor. Farmers State Bank v. Gray, 36 Idaho 49, 210 P. 1006 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where property covered by chattel mortgage has been sold by consent of parties without formality of foreclosure proceedings, it has become valueless without consent of mortgagee within meaning of this section. Farmers State Bank v. Gray, 36 Idaho 49, 210 P. 1006 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Security may become valueless by reason of physical destruction of property, or by removal of property from jurisdiction of court, or by its concealment or theft, and in all these cases, clearly, it is without any act of claimant or person to whom security is given. Farmers State Bank v. Gray, 36 Idaho 49, 210 P. 1006 (1922).

        It is not necessary that affidavit disclose that payment of debt “has not been secured by any mortgage or lien upon real or personal property, or any pledge of personal property,” when it appears from such affidavit that debt was originally secured and “that such security, without any act of the plaintiff, has become valueless.” Mitchell v.

        The fact that a debt was secured and that the property securing the same is beyond the territorial limits of the state is sufficient to prevent the issuance of attachment. Mason v. Jansen, 45 Idaho 354, 263 P. 484 (1927).

        Since an affidavit for attachment must show existence of jurisdictional facts at the time of the issuance of the writ, an affidavit filed twenty-eight (28) days before the issuance of the writ is not sufficient to support writ when issued, and writ should be discharged.

       No writ of attachment shall issue except upon the filing with the court of a written undertaking on the part of the plaintiff in such amount as determined to be proper by the court pursuant to subsection (e) of section 8-502, Idaho Code, to the effect that, if the defendant recover judgment, or if the attachment be wrongfully issued, the plaintiff will pay all costs that may be awarded to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking; and that if the attachment is discharged on the ground that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto under section 8-501, Idaho Code, the plaintiff will pay all damages which the defendant may have sustained by reason of the attachment, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking.

Such notice shall be kept posted at least ten (10) days and shall be published, if in a weekly paper, in three (3) issues thereof, and if any other than a weekly paper, in at least six (6) issues. Any creditor of the defendant, who, within thirty (30) days after the first posting and publication of such notice, shall commence and thereafter diligently prosecute to final judgment his action for his claim against the defendant shall share pro rata with the attaching creditor in the proceeds of defendant’s property where there is not sufficient to pay all judgments in full against him.

       <p>
        When property is attached on process out of the district court, all judgment creditors coming within the hereinabove prescribed rule are entitled to prorate, the theory being that the first attachment holds the property for the benefit of all creditors who reduce their claims to judgment within 60 days, thereby relieving them from the responsibility and the debtor from the costs of additional attachment process.

        Notice of issuance of writ of attachment required to be given by clerk is intended for protection and benefit of other creditors of defendant, and failure to give notice is not available to defendant in attachment proceeding, and does not enable him to avoid the attachment or subsequent execution sale thereunder.

        This section provides that a party aggrieved by a wrongful attachment may recover costs and damages sustained “by reason of the attachment.” This recovery may include attorney fees incurred in successfully challenging the attachment. However, when the attachment itself is not challenged, but the aggrieved party defeats the attachment simply by prevailing in the dispute over the alleged debt, the right to recover attorney fees under this section is unclear.

      The writ of attachment shall be directed to the sheriff of any county in which property of such defendant may be located, and must require him to attach and safely keep all the property of such defendant, within his county, not exempt from execution, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s demands, the amount of which must be stated in conformity with the complaint. If issued prior to hearing under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (c), section 8-503 [8-502], Idaho Code, the writ shall describe the specific property to be levied upon. If the court has directed the order in which the writ shall be levied upon different assets of the defendant under subsection (e), section<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c05s8-502" target="_blank">8-502</a></cite>, Idaho Code, the writ shall set forth such directions.

Several writs may be issued at the same time to the sheriffs of different counties, and the plaintiff may have other writs of attachment as often as he may require at any time before judgment, without further notice to the defendant.

        An action for damages for trespass to the personal property of the plaintiff did not depend upon the validity of the attachment proceedings against the debtor nor upon the validity of any purported attachment lien in favor of the creditor, it being sufficient in this case that the officer and the attorney for the creditor, armed with the summons and writ of attachment actually ousted the plaintiff from the possession and control of the truck and peaches, such being an invasion of the defendant’s right of property for which defendant was liable whether the officer and attorney perfected an attachment lien or not.

      § 8-506A. Attachment of a debtor’s interest in personal property subject to security agreement — Attachment of defendant’s interest in mortgage or trust deed — Attachment of defendant’s interest in security agreement.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Personal property subject to a security interest, a defendant’s equity of redemption in personal property and a defendant’s interest in a real estate mortgage or deed of trust or as secured party under a security agreement may be attached by the following methods, and no other:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t08c05s8-506Aol1a">
       Personal property capable of manual delivery may be attached by taking possession, provided all secured parties with a perfected security interest therein under the Idaho uniform commercial code consent thereto in writing, and the attachment shall be subject to the rights of any secured party under a perfected security agreement, but otherwise would be to the same effect and in the same manner as if the property were not subject to the security agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t08c05s8-506Aol1b">
       If any secured party with a perfected security interest does not consent in writing that the sheriff take possession of the personal property, the attaching creditor must pay or tender to the secured party the amount due on the security agreement before the officer may take the property into possession. The attaching creditor upon so redeeming shall be subrogated to the rights of the secured party under the security agreement, and the secured party shall, upon payment or tender assign the security agreement, note or notes so paid, and any filed financing statements to the attaching creditor. Upon any sale by judicial proceedings, any amounts owing to the attaching creditor on the security agreement so redeemed, with lawful interest thereon, shall first be paid to the attaching creditor.
      </li>

       If the attaching creditor so elects and instructs the sheriff, the equity of redemption of the defendant in the personal property subject to a perfected security agreement shall be attached. Such attachment is made by serving upon the secured party, upon the defendant, and upon the person in possession of the property, if other than the defendant or secured party, if said parties can be found within the county where the property is situated, a copy of the writ of attachment, together with a notice signed by the sheriff, describing the property attached, giving the name of the secured party, and stating the interest of the defendant in the property attached, and by causing the notice to be filed in the office where a security agreement or financing statement on said property should be filed to perfect the security according to the Idaho uniform commercial code or other applicable law. The sheriff shall make the filing by mail if in an office outside his county, and shall also file with the notice in any office where a financing statement should be filed for the property, a financing statement describing the property attached, the prior security agreement, and signed by the attaching creditor or his agent as secured party and for the defendant as debtor by the sheriff. The filing officer shall receive and file the financing statement and index the same pursuant to part 5, chapter 9, title 28, Idaho Code. Service and filing as above provided shall operate as an attachment of the property described in the notice, subject to the prior rights of the secured party under the security agreement; possession of the property shall not be taken by the sheriff. Compliance with the foregoing is constructive notice to the world of the attachment. Provided, however, that this section shall not be constructive notice to a bona fide purchaser for value of any motor vehicle who has actual or constructive possession of the vehicle and who has relied on the certificate of title for determination by said purchaser as to secured parties shown thereon; nothing in this section shall relieve any person from complying with section 49-504, Idaho Code.
    When the sale of such property attached under this subsection (c) is made on writ of execution obtained by such creditor, the proceeds must be applied as in the case of any other execution sale. The purchaser at any such sale acquires all title and rights of the judgment debtor in the property sold, as of the time the attachment was levied, subject to the perfected security agreement including all liens if any thereunder, securing obligations to be created after the security agreement was made in cases where such obligations have actually been created, and are by law entitled to priority over attaching creditors, and is entitled to the possession of such property subject, however, to the rights of the secured party.

       Any interest of the defendant as mortgagee of a real estate mortgage or beneficiary of a trust deed on real estate whether held directly or as an assignee, may be attached. The sheriff must record with the county recorder where the real property is located a copy of the writ along with a notice in writing, naming the defendant, describing the real property, and identifying the recording information on the real estate mortgage or trust deed, and stating that the defendant’s interest therein is attached, and by serving copies of the notice and writ upon the defendant and upon the mortgagor of the mortgage or trustor of the trust deed if they can be located within the county where the property is located. The recorder shall index the same as an assignment of the defendant’s interest in the mortgage or deed of trust, and it shall be constructive notice to the world of the attachment. The attachment shall be subject to the rights of a holder in due course of a note or notes secured by the mortgage or trust deed, whether acquired before or after the attachment.

The sheriff shall serve a copy of the notice and writ upon the defendant and upon the debtor under the security agreement, if they can be located within the county where the property is located. The sheriff may file the copy of the writ or notice by mail if the filing officer is outside the county. The filing officer shall index the same as an assignment of the defendant’s interest in the security agreements, and it shall be constructive notice to the world.

      Any transfer of encumbrance of the attached interest of the debtor-defendant is void as against the attaching creditor, but this provision shall not be construed as forbidding or invalidating any transfer or disposition of the property lawfully made pursuant to the prior security agreement, or any other right exercised or acquired thereunder.

      § 8-506C. Defendant’s undertaking — Return of property.
     </h3>
     <p>
      At any time the defendant may retain or require the return of all or any portion of the property upon filing with the court a written undertaking executed by two (2) or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that they are bound in an amount sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s claims, besides costs, or in an amount equal to the value of the specific property sought to be retained or returned which has been or is about to be attached. At the time of filing such undertaking, the defendant shall serve upon the plaintiff or his attorney a notice of filing such undertaking, to which a copy of such undertaking shall be attached; and shall cause proof of service thereof to be filed with the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      If such undertaking is in an amount sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s claims, besides costs, proceedings thereunder shall terminate, unless exception is taken to such sureties. If, at the time of filing of such undertaking in an amount sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s claims, plus costs, the property shall be in the custody of the sheriff, such property, together with all proceeds of the sales thereof, shall be returned to the defendant five (5) days after service of the notice of filing such undertaking upon plaintiff or his attorney, unless exception is taken to such sureties.
     </p>
     <p>
      If such undertaking is filed in an amount equal to the value of the specific property sought to be retained or returned and the court has previously determined the proper sum to be specified in such undertaking as provided in subsection (e), section 8-502, Idaho Code, the sheriff shall not execute the writ as to the specific property covered by such undertaking. If the property shall be in the custody of the sheriff, the property shall be returned to defendant five (5) days after service of the notice of filing such undertaking upon plaintiff or his attorney unless exception is taken to such sureties. If such undertaking filed in an amount equal to the value of the property sought to be returned and the court has not previously determined the proper amount to be specified in the undertaking pursuant to subsection (e), section 8-502, Idaho Code, the plaintiff may within four (4) days after service of the notice of filing give written notice to the court, the defendant, and the sheriff, if such property shall then be in the custody of the sheriff, that he objects to the amount of the undertaking. If he fails to do so, he is deemed to have waived all objections thereto and the sheriff shall not execute the writ as to the specific property covered by such undertaking, or if such property shall then be in the custody of the sheriff, it shall be returned to the defendant five (5) days after service of the notice of filing such undertaking upon plaintiff or his attorney. If the plaintiff objects to the amount of such undertaking, the court shall set the matter for hearing and upon examination of the evidence and testimony submitted and such other evidence or testimony as the judge may thereupon require, the court shall determine the proper amount to be specified in such undertaking. If the amount of the undertaking filed be found sufficient, or if the defendant file a new undertaking in such amount as fixed by the court, the property shall be returned to the defendant, unless exception is taken to such sureties on any new undertaking filed by defendant.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The qualification of sureties under any written undertaking referred to in this chapter shall be such as prescribed by the code in respect to bail upon an order of civil arrest. Either party may, within two (2) days after service of an undertaking or notice of filing an undertaking under the provisions of this chapter, give written notice to the court, the other party and the sheriff that he excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. If he fails to do so, he is deemed to have waived all objections to them. When a party excepts, the other party’s sureties shall justify on notice within not less than two (2), nor more than five (5) days, in like manner as upon bail upon civil arrest. If any of the defendant’s property be in the custody of the sheriff, he shall retain custody thereof until the justification is completed or waived or fails. If the sureties for the plaintiff’s undertaking, filed pursuant to section 8-503, Idaho Code, fail to justify, the writ of attachment must be vacated and the sheriff shall return the property to the defendant. If the sureties for the defendant’s undertaking, filed pursuant to section 8-506C, Idaho Code, fail to justify, the sheriff shall proceed as if no such undertaking had been filed. If the sureties justify or the exception is waived, the sheriff shall proceed as if no such exception had been filed.

To enable him to make such return as to the debts and credits attached, he must request, at the time of service, the party owing the debt or having the credit to give him a memorandum, stating the amount and description of each, and if such memorandum be refused, he must return the fact of refusal with the writ. The party refusing to give the memorandum may be required to pay the cost of any proceedings taken for the purpose of obtaining information respecting the amounts and description of such debt or credit.

      If any of the property attached be perishable, the sheriff must sell the same in the manner in which such property is sold on execution. The proceeds and other property attached by him must be retained by him to answer any judgment that may be recovered in the action, unless sooner subjected to execution upon another judgment recovered previous to issuing of the attachment. Debts and credits attached may be collected by him if the same can be done without suit. The sheriff’s receipt is a sufficient discharge for the amount paid.

      Whenever property has been taken by an officer under a writ of attachment, and it is made to appear satisfactory to the court, or a judge thereof, that the interests of the parties to the action will be subserved by a sale thereof, the court or judge may order such property to be sold in the same manner as property is sold under an execution, and the proceeds to be deposited in the court to abide the judgment in the action.

        Where a sheriff levied on personal property under attachment, and, while holding under such levy, received a second attachment, and levied on the same property under the second attachment, and afterwards, but before sale on either a third person claimed the property, the second attaching creditor indemnified the sheriff against loss under the second attachment, and the sheriff sold under execution in the first attachment suit, and paid all the proceeds to the first attaching creditor, the claimant of the property having recovered of the sheriff the value of the property sold, held: (1) that the sheriff could not recover on the indemnifying bond of the second attaching creditor; (2) that since the complaint did not claim, nor the proof show, that after the levy the sheriff did any act under the second attachment, the second attaching creditor was not liable; (3) that in such case, when plaintiff had rested, it was not error for the court to instruct the jury to find for the defendant; (4) and that in such case, the effect of an indemnifying bond must be determined by its own conditions.

        Where an amended affidavit for attachment showed that the original affidavit on which the attachment was issued was false in representing that the payment of the debt sued on had not been secured by a mortgage, in absence of a showing that the false statement in the original affidavit was made innocently, the trial judge was not bound to accept as true the amended affidavit stating that the security which had been given had become valueless.

        Right to challenge truth of allegations of affidavit is given to defendant to be exercised in action. It can not be collaterally attacked, if good on its face, except for fraud or collusion. Mitchell v. Ada Inv. Co., 42 Idaho 421, 246 P. 10 (1926).

        One against whom an attachment has wrongfully issued is entitled to recover, as a part of his damages for the wrong, the expenses which he incurred in defending against such attachment. Moseley v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 33 Idaho 37, 189 P. 862 (1920).

        Grounds for Discharge.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The only grounds upon which an attachment can be discharged is that writ is improperly or illegally issued; that the property levied upon is exempt from execution or is a homestead is not ground for discharging the writ. Mason v. Lieuallen, 4 Idaho 415, 39 P. 1117 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        The attachment will not be dissolved for mere irregularity in the issuance of the summons. Ridenbaugh v. Sandlin, 14 Idaho 472, 94 P. 827 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion to dissolve will not be turned into a demurrer. If complaint fails to state a cause of action, because facts pleaded are defectively stated, and it appears from complaint that a cause can be stated by amendment under the ordinary rules governing amendments, then on the hearing of the motion to dissolve, the amendment will be considered as having been made. If, however, complaint states no cause of action, then a motion to dissolve the attachment, on the ground that complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, will be considered and sustained. Ross v. Gold Ridge Mining Co., 14 Idaho 687, 95 P. 821 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        An affidavit alleging two or more distinct grounds of attachment in the alternative is insufficient, because it is impossible to determine which ground is relied on to sustain the attachment. Heaton v. Panhandle Smelting Co., 32 Idaho 146, 179 P. 510 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action for damages for trespass to personal property of plaintiff, namely ousting plaintiff from possession and control of his truck and contents was not an action for wrongful attachment under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c05s8-503" target="_blank">§ 8-503 </a></cite>nor a case in which plaintiff was entitled to appear in the probate court and move for dissolution pursuant to this section, the remedy and rights given by those sections being available only to defendant in the case in which attachment is issued. Jaquith v. Stanger, 79 Idaho 49, 310 P.2d 805 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Objection that writ is levied on separate property of wife could not be raised on motion to quash under this section. Objection that writ is levied on property in which defendant has no interest may be raised by the owner by petition in intervention setting forth facts sufficient to entitle intervenor to judgment, after a trial of the issues, removing cloud on her title. First Trust & Sav. Bank v. Randall, 57 Idaho 126, 63 P.2d 157 (1936).

        Even after the attached property has been redelivered to defendant upon bond, motion for discharge of attachment for irregularity will lie. Glidden v. Whittier, 46 F. 437 (C.C.D. Idaho 1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        The release of attached property by defendant by the execution of a proper undertaking is not a waiver of defects in the original proceeding, and defendant may move for a discharge of the writ of attachment on the ground that same was irregularly or improperly issued, after the release of his property.

        Where appellants did not move to vacate or set aside the attachments, which they had the right to do if they felt the attachments were illegal, they were estopped after judgment was entered to seek damages for the attachments issued. Nalder v. Crest Corp., 93 Idaho 744, 472 P.2d 310 (1970).

        Appointment of receivers to take charge of real property should never be made until the moving party shows himself clearly entitled thereto; the court should not take charge of real estate through the aid of a receiver as against a party in possession asserting title in himself unless the property is shown to be in imminent danger of great waste or irreparable injury.

        Where property of a corporation has suffered depreciation by fire and corporation is not in active operation and its capital stock is equally divided between contending factions, and its assets consist principally of cash, it is proper to appoint a receiver under subdivision 6 of this section, although none of the contingencies mentioned in subdivision 5 of this section have arisen. Gibbs v. Morgan, 9 Idaho 100, 72 P. 733 (1903).

        A receiver should be appointed on application of a stockholder of a corporation where it is shown that the directors and officers of the corporation are mismanaging its affairs for their personal advantage and gain; that the profits of the corporation’s business are being absorbed by such mismanagement in paying the salaries of favorite employees whose services are unnecessary; and that the corporation is so grossly mismanaged that such mismanagement, if continued, would necessarily result in its insolvency. Hall v. Nieukirk, 12 Idaho 33, 85 P. 485 (1906).

        This section authorizes the district court to appoint a receiver to receive and take charge of notes, accounts, certificates of the capital stock of corporations, and choses in action, and other personal property, where the necessity and occasion for such appointment is shown. Utah Ass’n of Credit Men v. Budge, 16 Idaho 751, 102 P. 390 (1909), rehearing denied, 16 Idaho 758, 102 P. 691 (1909).

        Where a foreign corporation leases its irrigation system to another corporation engaged in the distribution of water for rental and sale and the latter corporation becomes insolvent, the court has jurisdiction to appoint a receiver of the entire property of both corporations pending litigation to determine the interest a purchaser of water may have acquired in such system. Idaho Fruit Land Co. v. Great W. Beet Sugar Co., 17 Idaho 273, 105 P. 562 (1909).

        Right to have a receiver appointed is available in an action by a mortgagee for foreclosure where it appears that the property is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured, or that condition of the mortgage has not been performed, and the property is probably insufficient to discharge debt.

        Where mortgage requires mortgagor to keep property insured but provides that in case he fails to do so, mortgagee may insure and have an additional lien on the property for the amount paid for insurance, failure of mortgagor to insure is not such waste as to authorize appointment of a receiver.

        The fact that a mortgaged boat is being used to ply waters without the state is not grounds for the appointment of a receiver on the application of mortgagee, where the mortgage merely stipulates that the boat is not to be taken without the limits “of the United States” and it does not appear that it is being so taken, or that the waters in which it is used are any more dangerous than those within the state.

     <p>
      In any proceeding where the court has ordered either or both parents to pay any amount for the support of a minor child, the court may order either parent or both parents to assign such sum as the court may determine to be equitable to the county clerk, probation officer, or other officer of the court or county officer designated by the court to receive such payment, that portion of salary or wages of either parent due in the future to apply on the amount ordered by the court for the support and maintenance of the minor child. Such order shall be binding upon an employer upon the service of a copy of such order upon such employer and until further order of the court. Any such order may be modified or revoked at any time by the court. Any such assignment made pursuant to court order shall have priority as against any attachment, execution, or other assignment, unless otherwise ordered by the court.

     <p>
      In any proceeding where the court has ordered a parent or custodian to pay any amount for the care, support or maintenance of a child adjudged to be within the purview of chapter 5, title 20, Idaho Code, and through the adjudication has rendered a liability upon the parent or custodian to pay damages or to pay for the child’s support and care, the following procedure may be utilized for collection. The court may order the parent or custodian to assign a sum as the court may determine to be equitable or as may otherwise be provided by statute or contract to the county clerk, probation officer or other office of the court or county officer designated by the court to receive such payment. The assignment shall be that portion of salary or wages of the parent or custodian the court deems would be due in the future to apply on the amount ordered by the court for the care, support or maintenance of the delinquent child or for breach of contract caused by the child’s delinquency. The order shall be binding upon an employer and until further order of the court. Any such order may be modified or revoked at any time by the court. Any such assignment made pursuant to court order shall have priority as against any attachment, execution or other assignment, unless otherwise ordered by the court. All sums collected pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be remitted as may be provided by law.
