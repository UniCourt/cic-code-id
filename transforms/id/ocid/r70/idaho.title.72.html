         The terms “this law” at the beginning of subsection (1) refers to S.L. 1971, chapter 124, which is generally compiled as<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-101" target="_self">§§ 72-101 </a></cite>to 72-805 and 72-1365.

         Section 1 of S.L. 1971, ch. 124 read: “This act is a comprehensive recodification of the workmen’s compensation and occupational disease compensation laws of the state of Idaho.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 2 of said act read: “Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12, Title 72, Idaho Code, and other acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this law are hereby repealed, such repeal to be effective as of the effective date of this law, provided that said chapters, acts and parts of acts shall remain in effect as to injuries suffered and occupational diseases manifested prior to the effective date of this law.”

        <p>

        <p>
         A claimant seeking compensation for an employment related injury has the burden of showing a “compensable disablement” under the Idaho worker’s compensation law. Ogden v. Thompson, 128 Idaho 87, 910 P.2d 759 (1996).
    In granting summary judgment for the company, whose manager engaged in sexual intercourse with a minor employee, the district court had concluded that the minor suffered an injury, a broken hymen, caused by an accident at work. However, a ruptured hymen was not “an unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap, or untoward event”; it was something that typically occurred when a virgin engaged in sexual intercourse. Consequently, since there was no accident, as defined by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>(17)(b), the minor did not suffer a personal injury, as defined by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>(17)(c), and her tort claims were not preempted by the exclusivity provisions of the Idaho worker’s compensation act. Roe v. Albertson’s, Inc., 141 Idaho 524, 112 P.3d 812 (2005).

         Home care provider failed to meet her burden of proving she received a bite which allegedly caused Lyme disease in the course of her employment. Koester v. State Ins. Fund, 124 Idaho 205, 858 P.2d 744 (1993).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a slight or expectable deviation from a business route or purpose is permissible under the dual purpose doctrine, if subsequent detours were such deviations from the business purpose of the trip that they broke the causal chain leading to the accident, the accident could not be said to have arisen out of or in the course of the worker’s employment. Mondragon v. A & L Reforestation, Inc., 130 Idaho 305, 939 P.2d 1384 (1997).

         Where there was evidence that employee-claimant and crew members after leaving lodge where they had consumed one beer and according to witnesses had a slight altercation with some other patrons were, when the accident happened, headed towards both their camp site as well as two establishments that sold alcohol, the commission’s decision that there was sufficient deviation from employee’s purpose to render the dual purpose doctrine inapplicable was proper. Mondragon v. A & L Reforestation, Inc., 130 Idaho 305, 939 P.2d 1384 (1997).

         Where work site was not sufficiently remote or isolated, as it was near several cities, where the availability of social drinking in lodge 10 miles from the camp site did not appear to be an incentive for employment with the employer and with regard to the recreational activity of social drinking, the circumstances of the employee’s employment were not any different or more hazardous than any other employment, and thus the evidence did not present factual circumstances for the application of the remote work doctrine permitting compensation of workers living at remote work sites who are injured while engaging in recreational activities.

         Accident.
        </h5>
        <p>
         The definition of “accident,” which requires that an injury, to be compensable, must be caused by an event or mishap which can reasonably be located as to time when and place where it occurred, does not necessarily exclude compensation for conditions resulting from repetitive trauma over a period of time. Wynn v. J.R. Simplot Co., 105 Idaho 102, 666 P.2d 629 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant suffered spinal disc rupture while operating a front-end loader which subjected him to continual jarring and shaking, the evidence established that he suffered his injury at a particular time, at a particular place, while engaged in his normal and ordinary work for his employer; the fact that his spine may have been weak and predisposed him to a ruptured disc did not prevent an award since the compensation law does not limit awards to workmen who, prior to injury, were in sound condition and perfect health but, rather, an employer takes an employee as he finds him. Wynn v. J.R. Simplot Co., 105 Idaho 102, 666 P.2d 629 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to constitute an accident, the claimant need not show that he or she suffered injury at a particular time and at a particular place, but rather must reasonably locate the injury as to time when and place where it occurred. Hazen v. General Store, 111 Idaho 972, 729 P.2d 1035 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was more than sufficient substantial, competent evidence to sustain the finding of the industrial commission that the claimant’s herniated disk was not the result of an accident but rather occurred over a longer period of time, as the result of the aging process, given the testimony of an expert witness, the claimant’s own testimony, the testimony of her employment supervisor, and the history taken by the chiropractor. Hazen v. General Store, 111 Idaho 792, 729 P.2d 1035 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         The industrial commission properly understood that subdivision (14)(b) [now (18)(b)] of this section only requires an accident to be reasonably located as to time and place where the issue before the commission was whether or not an industrial accident had occurred at all. Blackwell v. Omark Indus., 114 Idaho 10, 752 P.2d 612 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Worker’s compensation claimant’s back injury was properly held not to have been an accident under this section where claimant never identified her pain to her doctor as work related, where she did not report any work related injury to her employer until six weeks after the alleged accident, where she had been experiencing intermittent back pain for the previous six years, and where the record contained evidence that claimant’s problem may have been ongoing and not the result of an “unlooked for mishap, or untoward event.” Vernon v. Omark Indus., 115 Idaho 486, 767 P.2d 1261 (1989).
    Workers’ compensation claimant bears the burden of proving that an injury-causing accident occurred by proving that an unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap or untoward event took place, and where claimant’s injury was an aggravation of an existing knee injury sustained in 1987, claimant did not meet this burden and industrial commission’s finding that he failed to prove the occurrence of a compensable accident within the meaning of this section was based on substantial and competent evidence and was not clearly erroneous. Langley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 126 Idaho 781, 890 P.2d 732 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was no finding of an “accident” within the terms of subdivision (17)(b) [now (18)(b)] and the actions cited by the commission were not sufficient to support the finding of an “accident” as defined by this section and interpreted by the courts. Combes v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 430, 942 P.2d 554 (1997).
        </p>
        <p>
         Employee failed to prove that he was injured as a result of workplace accidents pursuant to subdivision (17)(b) [now (18)(b)] where he gave contradictory statements regarding the time of the alleged accidents and where no medical records mentioned the mishaps in question; he bore the burden of establishing an accident by a preponderance of the evidence and failed to do so. Painter v. Potlatch Corp., 138 Idaho 309, 63 P.3d 435 (2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Aggravation of the worker’s pre-existing condition in her thumbs caused by repetitive motion did not become an accident simply because the worker could locate the time period when the pre-existing condition became symptomatic; therefore, the findings of the Idaho industrial commission did not show an accident as defined in subsection (17) [now (18)]. Konvalinka v. Bonneville County, 140 Idaho 477, 95 P.3d 628 (2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Idaho industrial commission erred in concluding that the claimant did not experience an “accident” when she rose from the chair; the injury resulted from an unexpected mishap arising out of her employment. Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., 141 Idaho 342, 109 P.3d 1084 (2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         In granting summary judgment for the company, whose manager engaged in sexual intercourse with a minor employee, the district court had concluded that the minor suffered an injury, a broken hymen, caused by an accident at work. However, a ruptured hymen was not “an unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap, or untoward event”; it was something that typically occurred when a virgin engaged in sexual intercourse. Consequently, since there was no accident, as defined by subdivision (17)(b) [now (18)(b)], the minor did not suffer a personal injury, as defined by subdivision (17)(c) [now (18)(c)], and her tort claims were not preempted by the exclusivity provisions of the Idaho worker’s compensation act . Roe v. Albertson’s, Inc., 141 Idaho 524, 112 P.3d 812 (2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Denial of compensation to the employee in a workers’ compensation action was proper because he had failed to prove that the heart attack he suffered while at work was an industrial accident; his cardiologist could not determine whether the attack was triggered by events occurring before or after the employee arrived at work. Henry v. Dep’t of Corr., 154 Idaho 143, 295 P.3d 528 (2013).

        <p>
         The claimant’s proof must establish a probable, not merely a possible, connection to the cause and effect to support a contention that the compensable accident occurred. Vernon v. Omark Indus., 113 Idaho 358, 744 P.2d 86 (1987).
    Injury was not compensable where the industrial commission determined that the claimant, a flagger on highway construction sites, did not report the accident to her employer within the 60 day period required by law, that the alleged accident did not occur, and that claimant’s concededly debilitated condition was not sufficiently causally related to any incident that occurred during the course of her employment for it to be compensable. Becker v. Flaggers, 120 Idaho 521, 817 P.2d 187 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where industrial commission concluded that claimant’s accident failed to rise to a compensable level, as defined by subsection (15) [now (18)] of this section, because worker failed to provide any proof, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the damage asserted was caused by the accident and failed to demonstrate on appeal that the commission’s holding was clearly erroneous or that its finding was not supported by substantial and competent evidence under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-732" target="_self">§ 72-732</a></cite>, the commission’s conclusion was affirmed. Langley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 126 Idaho 781, 890 P.2d 732 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where worker made a claim for occupational disease, the claimant had the burden of proving, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, a causal connection between the condition for which compensation was claimed and occupational exposure to the substance or conditions which caused the alleged condition, and although physician’s records indicated that claimant’s work environment may have irritated his asthma condition, none stated that his condition was related, with a reasonable degree of probability, to his work environment, thus the industrial commission’s conclusion denying compensation was supported by substantial and competent evidence and would not be disturbed on appeal. Langley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 126 Idaho 781, 890 P.2d 732 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the physician expressly refused to say the words “reasonable degree of medical probability,” it is clear from his testimony that he considered that the employee’s renal failure to be more likely than not caused by his ingestion of the medication received at work; and the physician’s testimony, coupled with the facts, adequately established a causal connection between the employee’s ingestion of the medication and his renal failure. Jensen v. City of Pocatello, 135 Idaho 406, 18 P.3d 211 (2000).
        </p>
        <p>
         Employee’s shoulder injury resulting from reaching across a conveyor belt met the definition of an accident as defined by subsection (17)(b) [now (18)(b)] of this section. It was an unexpected, unlooked for mishap resulting from her employment and could be reasonably located in time and place to the specific reaching incident that occurred on a specific date, so it was caused by an accident in the course of her employment. Spivey v. Novartis Seed Inc., 137 Idaho 29, 43 P.3d 788 (2002).

        <p>
         From the employee’s perspective, the injury that befell him was an accident as it was an untoward event, connected to the industry in which it occurred, which could be reasonably located as to time and place; it was no contradiction for the employee to maintain he suffered an accident covered by worker’s compensation and at the same time argue he was harmed by the employer’s intentional acts.

         Aggravation of Underlying Disease.
        </h5>
        <p>
         Although claimant argued that his underlying disease was aggravated sufficiently by his employment to render him disabled, the aggravation was not the result of an industrial accident and would not be compensable; otherwise, any distinction between “injury” and “occupational disease” would be meaningless. Nycum v. Triangle Dairy Co., 109 Idaho 858, 712 P.2d 559 (1985).
    Where there was conflicting evidence as to the cause of claimant’s hand condition, the industrial commission’s finding that claimant’s hand condition was not an occupational disease under subdivision (17)(a) [now (22)(a)] of this section because it was causally related to his diabetes and not to his employment was supported by substantial, competent evidence on the record and therefore was not clearly erroneous as a matter of law. Nycum v. Triangle Dairy Co., 109 Idaho 858, 712 P.2d 559 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         A series of mini-traumas caused by the repetitive motions of claimant’s job did not constitute an identifiable accident for purposes of compensating the aggravation of carpal tunnel syndrome. Nelson v. Ponsness-Warren Idgas Enters., 126 Idaho 129, 879 P.2d 592 (1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Idaho industrial commission did not err by finding that a closed head injury was related to employment where the medical evidence showed that a claimant fell and hit his head on a concrete floor during an insulin reaction; the medical evidence showed that the exertion of the claimant’s usual work lowered his blood sugar, which ultimately resulted in the fall and the head injury. Hutton v. Manpower, Inc., 143 Idaho 573, 149 P.3d 848 (2006).

         Aggravation of a preexisting condition may constitute an injury if it is precipitated by an accident. Fife v. Home Depot, Inc., 151 Idaho 509, 260 P.3d 1180 (2011).

        <p>
         A claimant in a workmen’s compensation cause has the burden of proving compensable disablement, caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. His proof must establish a probable, not merely a possible, connection between cause and effect to support his contention that he suffered a compensable accident. Callantine v. Blue Ribbon Linen Supply, 103 Idaho 734, 653 P.2d 455 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         Claimant failed to meet her burden of proving a reasonable degree of medical probability that the injury for which benefits were claimed were casually related to her on-the-job accident where she testified that she was in unrelenting pain between July, 1989, the time of the work related injury, and June, 1990, when the surgery for myelopathy occurred, but doctor testified that it was not likely that claimant could have functioned for the 11 months if the on-the-job accident had caused her myelopathy and that it was unlikely for such a condition to occur related to something 11 months earlier, although 2 other doctors gave conflicting opinions indicating that the injury was related to the injury that occurred at work, since the commission and not the supreme court, evaluates the credibility of expert witnesses and the commission accepted the first doctor’s opinion.

         Where compensation claimant described no specific mishap or event which caused his knee injury, where the proof showed only that his knee gradually became painful and was extremely painful at the conclusion of his work shift, and that he had a history of injuring his knee in the previous year and where he testified that he had been experiencing some problems with his leg prior to commencement of his work shift, there was nothing in the record that would sustain a finding that he sustained an injury on the job that would entitle him to compensation.

        <p>
         Idaho industrial commission’s finding that the claimant failed to show that his herniated disc was caused by a compensable accident was not supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record. The court held that the claimant’s testimony was credible because, although his descriptions as to the cause of his injury were more vague prior to the oral hearing, he consistently maintained that his injury arose from the jostling and vibrations of his forklift; the claimant’s testimony was not the only evidence linking his herniated disc to March 9, 2004, as two physicians stated that the acute onset of pain that the claimant experienced on that date was consistent with a finding that his disc herniated at that time.

         Industrial commission erred in concluding that an employee’s injuries — sustained in an automobile accident when returning home from an independent medical evaluation (IME) scheduled by the surety in connection with an earlier industrial accident — were not compensable, because the IME was employer-requested, with a doctor chosen by employer, at a time and place chosen by employer, solely for employer’s benefit, and failure to attend the IME would have resulted in suspension of the employee’s right to benefits.

         An injured worker must do more than show an onset of pain while at work in order to sustain his or her burden of proving an event or mishap occurred, and standing for two hours did not an accident make, hence, claimant was not entitled to worker’s compensation benefits.

        </p>
        <p>
         There are three methods by which the employee may prove a prima facie case of odd-lot status: (1) by showing what other types of employment the employee has attempted, (2) by showing that the employee, or vocational counselors, employment agencies, or the Job Service on behalf of the employee, have searched for other work for the employee, and that other work was not available, or (3) any efforts of the employee to find suitable employment would have been futile.

         Employee sustained his burden of proving that while he was physically able to perform some work, he was so handicapped that he would not be employed regularly in any well-known branch of the labor market absent a business boom, the sympathy of a particular employer or friends, temporary good luck, or a superhuman effort on his part; this is the formulation of “odd-lot” worker. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where estimates as to the portion of the jobs employee could have performed before his accident that he was precluded from performing after the accident ranged from 20 percent to 80 percent, the employee was not an “odd-lot” worker as a matter of law.

         Industrial commission erred in its determination that medical benefits awarded to workers’ compensation claimant who was totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot doctrine could be assessed totally against employer’s surety and were not apportionable under the 1990 version of this section; though that would be the case following the 1991 amendments to this section, this award of medical benefits had to be apportioned in the same proportion as the determined responsibility of the industrial special indemnity fund and employer’s surety for the nonmedical portions of the award.

         In a wrongful death action, the determination of whether the decedent had been an employee of defendant, rather than an independent contractor or a casual employee, while engaged in making repairs to broken equipment at the bottom of a drill shaft, was a question of fact for the jury, for the question bore not only upon the issue of the court’s jurisdiction but also upon the standard of care that defendant owed to the decedent.

        <p>
         Every principal contractor necessarily extends to a subcontractor the right to do work on the involved premises, and the principal does not thereby necessarily change the status of a subcontractor to the status of an employee; therefore, the commission’s rationale, in holding that alleged employer’s ownership of timber cutting rights was a factor in determining employment status of claimant injured while working as a logger, was erroneous.

         The test of whether a party is an “employer” under subdivision (10) [now (13)] of this section does not require the employer to control the means by which the work is performed; however, the right-to-control test is relevant in determining whether the injured person is an employee covered by workmen’s compensation, or whether the person is an independent contractor not entitled to workmen’s compensation protection, and may also be relevant where a distinction must be made between a direct employer and a nondirect employer.

         The ultimate question in finding an employment relationship is whether the employer assumes the right to control the time, manner and method of executing the work of the employee, as distinguished from the right merely to require certain definite results in conformity with their agreement. Four factors are traditionally used in determining whether a “right to control” exists, including, (1) direct evidence of the right; (2) the method of payment; (3) furnishing major items of equipment; and (4) the right to terminate the employment relationship at will and without liability.

         Worker hired by subcontractor to shake roof on part time basis was ruled an employee of general contractor for the purpose of determining liability for workers’ compensation benefits; although worker was paid on a production basis, subcontractor had right to control worker’s work, the only major item of equipment was, in essence, supplied by subcontractor who rented the equipment from the worker, and the subcontractor and worker had the right to terminate their relationship at will and without liability.

         In action for benefits for injuries sustained in accident by plaintiff who was driving defendant’s truck under arrangement with regular driver to substitute for him for a quasi-contractual obligation to arise, the employer would have to have been unjustly enriched by his retention of the benefits of the plaintiff’s services. However, where the employer was not unjustly enriched, even if he received a “benefit” from the plaintiff’s services upon receipt of the contractor’s payment, the employer indirectly compensated the plaintiff for his services for upon receiving payment from the contractor, the employer paid the driver the amount upon which they had agreed and the driver, in turn, paid the plaintiff the amount they had negotiated when the plaintiff agreed to substitute for the driver. Thus, the employer had already compensated the plaintiff for his services and, consequently, for the value of any “benefit” that the employer received. Kennedy v.

         Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a factory in a wrongful death action against it by a decedent’s survivors because the factory qualified as the decedent’s statutory employer, pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-216" target="_self">§ 72-216</a></cite>(1) and this section, due to its contractual relationship with the decedent’s employer for wastewater hauling services.

         Trial court erred in finding that a farm, as a mere landowner, was decedent’s statutory employer; nothing in the record indicated that the farm was engaged in the business of hauling wastewater for pecuniary gain, which was the work being done by the decedent. The farm was not entitled to immunity under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-223" target="_self">§ 72-223</a></cite>; summary judgment to the farm was affirmed on the alternate basis that the survivors failed to create a material issue of fact for trial that the farm breached any applicable duty of care, or how any breach proximately caused injury.

         Claimant was not entitled to an award of workers’ compensation benefits, because there was substantial and competent evidence to support the industrial commission’s finding that the claimant did not show that he was injured in an accident, by falling from a ladder while working in an orchard. The claimant’s credibility was suspect as his testimony was both internally inconsistent and inconsistent with the other evidence presented at the hearing. Fonseca v.

         There was sufficient evidence in the record to support the commission’s finding that claimant was not an independent contractor. Most of the tools and equipment were purchased by employer. Claimant had no authority to hire any other person to work with him. There was evidence that claimant was instructed to work regular hours each day, check in with the apartment manager when he arrived, inform the manager of what he intended to do that day, fill out forms to account for his time, and change the task he was doing when requested by the manager. He did not submit a bid for the work done. Instead, he was paid $1,500 a month regardless of the amount of work completed. He was terminable at will. He was not hired for a specific result, but rather completed assigned work as needed. Mortimer v. Riviera Apts., 122 Idaho 839, 840 P.2d 383 (1992).

        </p>
        <p>
         While a worker’s underlying pain and exacerbation of pain were work related, the worker failed to provide any medical evidence connecting the aggravation of her condition to an unexpected, undesigned and unlooked for mishap or untoward event, reasonably identifiable as to the time when and the place where it occurred, and therefore failed to show she suffered an “injury” caused by an “accident” as defined under subsection (17) [now (18)] of this section.

        </p>
        <p>
         Because the employee denied suffering any physical injury for much of the litigation, and the claim that she had suffered injuries to her brain was first raised much later, the industrial commission could reasonably conclude that the employer did not have knowledge that the employee suffered a physical injury as a result of police interviews; substantial and competent evidence supported the finding that the employer did not have the knowledge required to excuse the employee’s failure to give proper notice of her claim for worker’s compensation benefits. Gibson v. Ada County Sheriff’s Office, 147 Idaho 491, 211 P.3d 100 (2009).
    The type of injury covered under workers’ compensation is that caused by an accident, which results in violence to the physical structure of the body. An accident is an unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap or untoward event. The injury former employee claims was not caused by violence to the body, but rather emotional distress for termination of employment, unrelated to any physical injury. As such, it is not the type of “injury” contemplated by this section. Bollinger v. Fall River Rural Elec. Coop., Inc., 152 Idaho 632, 272 P.3d 1263 (2012).
        </p>

         It is not enough for a claimant to show that his injury is work-related: rather, he has to prove, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that the injury for which benefits are claimed is causally related to an accident occurring in the course of employment.

         By smoking while she waited for the product she was to label, the employee may be said to have done an authorized act in a forbidden manner, but this slight deviation of the employer’s rule regulating how the work was to be performed was not enough to deny the employee’s claim. Although the injury occurred when the employee jumped off of the rail dock to retrieve her cigarette, the smoking was not the cause of the injury, because the injury could as easily have resulted from the employee jumping off the rail dock to reclaim an earring, necklace or other personal item that had fallen to the ground.

Given the decedent’s statement that he had to return to the work site, his apparent frustration regarding that fact, and the fact that he was driving within the employer’s active logging site, it was reasonable to believe that the decedent was driving to a storage container to perform some work-related function, and not for some personal reason.

        </p>
        <p>
         An employee traveling to and from work is not within the course of his employment and is not covered by workmen’s compensation except where travel to and from work involves a special exposure to a hazard or risk peculiarly associated with the employment which is the cause of the injury, and this special risk doctrine only deals with an employee going to and from his work situs. Ridgway v. Combined Ins. Cos. of Am., 98 Idaho 410, 565 P.2d 1367 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         When an employee’s work requires him to travel away from the employer’s place of business or his normal place of work, the employee is covered by workmen’s compensation while attending to matters such as eating or securing lodging, unless the particular trip represents an unreasonable departure in order to pursue some purely personal activity not connected with his employment or necessary to maintain himself while traveling. Ridgway v. Combined Ins. Cos. of Am., 98 Idaho 410, 565 P.2d 1367 (1977).

        </p>
        <p>
         Unless an exception applies, under ordinary circumstances a worker is not in the course of employment while going to and from an employer’s place of business; the reason an employee is generally not awarded compensation for injuries that occur while traveling to and from work is that the employment relationship is considered to be suspended from the time the employee leaves his work to go home until he resumes his work the next day. Barker v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 105 Idaho 108, 666 P.2d 635 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         The payment of travel expenses, along with other evidence indicating the employer intended to compensate the employee for travel time, will justify expanding the course of employment to include going to and from work; however, an employee will not be within the course of employment when traveling a route prohibited by the employer. Barker v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 105 Idaho 108, 666 P.2d 635 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though the general rule is that an employee is not within the course of employment while traveling to and from work, the concept of “course of employment” is extended when there is a special risk or service incident to the employee’s employment involved in his travel. Barker v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 105 Idaho 108, 666 P.2d 635 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         The payment of travel expenses is only some evidence that the employer regarded the employee’s travel as part of his job. Barker v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 105 Idaho 108, 666 P.2d 635 (1983).
    Where the employee, who received $90 per week as a travel allowance for travel between his home and the work site, was killed while traveling from the work site to a dentist appointment, the industrial commission’s finding that the employee was not within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident was supported by substantial and competent evidence. Barker v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 110 Idaho 871, 719 P.2d 1131 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the claimant was compensated for his travel to the work place, the claimant’s accident did not occur within the course and scope of employment where the accident occurred on a route not contemplated by the employment agreement and for which the employer was not paying compensation.

        <p>
         In action for death benefits by wife of employee killed while traveling home from work, evidence supported commission’s finding that there was no special risk, in connection with decedent employee’s travel to and from work site located 137 miles from his home, which would warrant application of “special risk” exception to general rule that a worker killed or injured while traveling to or from work is not “in the course of employment” and, thus, is not entitled to benefits.

         There was no exception applicable that would remove claimant from the general rule that injuries suffered traveling to work are not covered by worker’s compensation, because it was entirely up to the claimant where to park, and claimant opted to park on the public right-of-way for personal, not work-related, reasons.

         Accident.
        </h5>
        <p>
         Federal court is bound by decisions of state Supreme Court construing term “accident.” Sullivan Mining Co. v. Aschenbach, 33 F.2d 1 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 280 U.S. 586, 50 S. Ct. 35, 74 L. Ed. 635 (1929).
        </p>
        <p>
         Injury may have been caused “by accident” although it resulted from the operation of known and usual causes. Sullivan Mining Co. v. Aschenbach, 33 F.2d 1 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 280 U.S. 586, 50 S. Ct. 35, 74 L. Ed. 635 (1929).
        </p>
        <p>
         Word “accident” was employed in its ordinary sense as meaning an unlooked for and untoward event which was not expected or designed. McNeil v. Panhandle Lumber Co., 34 Idaho 773, 203 P. 1068 (1921); Aldrich v. Dole, 43 Idaho 30, 249 P. 87 (1926); In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing more was required than that harm that plaintiff had sustained shall have been unexpected. It was enough that causes themselves known as usual should have produced result which on particular occasion was neither designed nor expected. Aldrich v. Dole, 43 Idaho 30, 249 P. 87 (1926).
    Even in view of liberal construction of statute, it was not enough for applicant to say that accident would not have happened if he had not been engaged in particular employment, or if he had not been at particular place. He must go further and say that accident arose because of something he was doing in course of his employment and because he was exposed by nature of his employment to some particular danger. Walker v. Hyde, 43 Idaho 625, 253 P. 1104 (1927).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where hernia appeared suddenly and immediately following injury sustained while employee was operating road grader, compensation was properly awarded. In re Hillhouse’s Estate, 46 Idaho 730, 271 P. 459 (1928).
        </p>
        <p>
         Statute does not speak of accident as separate and distinct thing to be considered apart from its consequences, but word “accident” is introduced to qualify word “injury.” In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929).
        </p>
        <p>
         While an accident may have been slight and the untoward circumstances meager, there must have been some distinctive unexpected happening. Croy v. McFarland-Brown Lumber Co., 51 Idaho 32, 1 P.2d 189 (1931); Walters v. Weiser, 66 Idaho 615, 164 P.2d 593 (1945).
        </p>
        <p>
         The law did not exact certainties, it acted upon probabilities. It was sufficient to establish an accident and the time thereof with reasonable probability. Riley v. Boise City, 54 Idaho 335, 31 P.2d 968 (1934); Wozniak v. Stoner Meat Co., 57 Idaho 439, 65 P.2d 768 (1937); Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937); Nistad v. Winston Lumber Co., 59 Idaho 533, 85 P.2d 236 (1938).
        </p>
        <p>
         The court would not place a narrow or hypercritical construction upon this section in determining what injuries were “accidents” or “occupational diseases.” Brown v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 49, 87 P.2d 1000 (1938).
        </p>
        <p>
         To be an accident, it need not have occurred at one instant, but there may have been repetitious causes all relatively slight which culminated and resulted in as serious and fatal an injury as though the disabling or lethal blow or incident occurred at one time. Brown v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 49, 87 P.2d 1000 (1938). But see Goaslind v. Pocatello, 61 Idaho 435, 102 P.2d 650 (1940).
        </p>
        <p>
         Hernia, as injury neither expected nor designed, was compensable, notwithstanding lack of evidence of any slip, wrench or sudden jerk. Cook v. Winget, 60 Idaho 561, 94 P.2d 676 (1939); Hieronymus v. Stone’s Food Stores, 60 Idaho 727, 96 P.2d 435 (1939).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to sustain an award for a hernia, where the evidence showed that the employee had resumed his work about in the same manner as which he had theretofore done, it was not necessary that there should be any evidence of any slip, wrench or sudden jerk. Hieronymus v. Stone’s Food Stores, 60 Idaho 727, 96 P.2d 435 (1939).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was not an easy task for the board or the court, to always discern the exact dividing line beyond which an incident or happenstance became sufficiently definite and localized as to time, place and circumstance, that it may have been legally designated an accident; the difficulty of the task, however, instead of relieving the board or court of the duty, rendered it the more imperative that the duty be discharged with sound discrimination. Hoffman v. Consumers Water Co., 61 Idaho 226, 99 P.2d 919 (1940).
        </p>
        <p>
         An injury received by an employee was none the less an accident because he was doing the work he was expected to do, and in the manner contemplated and it was not necessary, where an employee was injured and received a stroke by reason of the performance of his duties, that he should have slipped or fallen, or that some machinery or other equipment had failed. Pinson v. Minidoka Hwy. Dist., 61 Idaho 731, 106 P.2d 1020 (1940).
    Where the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] found that the stroke, with which the employee was suffering at a stated time, was the result of his lifting and straining on a drill which had become stuck in a hole, and was personal injury by accident arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, that was sufficient as a finding that the injury occurred within the scope of the employment by accident. Pinson v. Minidoka Hwy. Dist., 61 Idaho 731, 106 P.2d 1020 (1940).
        </p>
        <p>
         An “accident” occurred in doing what the workman habitually did, if any unexpected, undesigned, unlooked-for or untoward event or mishap, connected with, or growing out of, the employment took place. Pinson v. Minidoka Hwy. Dist., 61 Idaho 731, 106 P.2d 1020 (1940); Laird v. State Hwy. Dep’t, 80 Idaho 12, 323 P.2d 1079 (1958).
        </p>
        <p>
         Death was not in itself an “accident” within the statutory definition in the compensation law, though often the result of an accident. Wade v. Pacific Coast Elevator Co., 64 Idaho 176, 129 P.2d 894 (1942).
        </p>
        <p>
         Death of workman in his lodging as result of heart attack sustained upon his return from evening meal was not due to accident. In re Carrie, 73 Idaho 503, 254 P.2d 410 (1953).
        </p>
        <p>
         Sudden death of able-bodied employee while doing light work in normal course of his employment was not compensable where board made no finding as to cause of death, since sudden death in itself is not an accident. Swan v. Williamson, 74 Idaho 32, 257 P.2d 552 (1953).
        </p>
        <p>
         An accident is an unexpected, undesigned and unlooked-for mishap happening suddenly and connected with the employment and definite in time and place of occurrence. Swan v. Williamson, 74 Idaho 32, 257 P.2d 552 (1953); Welch v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 87 Idaho 396, 393 P.2d 594 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         The workmen’s compensation law as adopted in 1917 did not contain a definition of the term “accident.” Lewis v. Department of Law Enforcement, 79 Idaho 40, 311 P.2d 976 (1957).
        </p>
        <p>
         On claim made by widow and minor daughter before the board for death benefits, claiming deceased’s death was caused by an accident received in, arising out of and in the course of his employment the evidence did not support a finding of accidental personal injury causing death, but that death was caused by a cerebral hemorrhage due to a vascular arteriosclerotic disease. Darvell v. Wardner Indus. Union, 78 Idaho 309, 302 P.2d 950 (1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the board had no substantial competent evidence, it was error to find against employer’s surety for 1955 that an exacerbation in 1955 was the result of an accident in that year, rather than as a result of an injury to claimant prior to 1955. Beard v. Post Co., 82 Idaho 38, 348 P.2d 939 (1960).

         Acceleration or aggravation of latent physical defect, aneurysm, resulting from a not unusual strain in lifting tackle into wagon and attempting to put burr on bolt, was held an accident. In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929).
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of preexisting conditions, if disability was precipitated by accident arising out of employment, and if disability probably would not have arisen except for accident, statute contemplated full compensation. Strouse v. Hercules Mining Co., 51 Idaho 7, 1 P.2d 203 (1931).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where employee knowing he had a weak heart continued work for ten days after contracting influenza, left sickbed to attend a meeting, and died three days later of rheumatic heart disease complicated by influenza, there was no compensable “accident.” Walters v. Weiser, 66 Idaho 615, 164 P.2d 593 (1945).
    Where nature of work was such that a workman, either in normal health or with some latent weakness over a period of time, injured himself in unforeseen way and some final act caused the flareup that brought about outward evidence of injury, caused by a single untoward event or a series of untoward events, workman suffered an injury resulting from an accident which was compensable if done in the course of and arising out of employment. Walters v. Weiser, 66 Idaho 615, 164 P.2d 593 (1945).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the board had no substantial competent evidence, it was error to find against employer’s surety for 1955 that an exacerbation in 1955 was the result of an accident in that year, rather than as a result of an injury to claimant prior to 1955.

         Evidence that a deputy sheriff with preexisting essential hypertension with atherosclerosis suffered a fatal stroke as a result of physical exertion and emotional strain in performing his duties at the scene of an accident supported a finding that the deputy died as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.

         There must have been a causal connection between a strain occasioned by the work being done and the resulting injury. The proof must have shown that the strain was the cause or a contributing cause of the injury before a recovery could have been had. Lewis v. Department of Law Enforcement, 79 Idaho 40, 311 P.2d 976 (1957).

         As a general rule where an employee was assaulted and injury was inflicted upon him through animosity and ill will arising from some cause wholly disconnected with the employer’s business or the employment the employee could not recover compensation simply because he was assaulted when he was in the discharge of his duties.

         The general test was the right to control and direct the activities of the employee, or the power to control the details of work to be performed, and to determine how it should have been done and whether it should stop or continue, that gave rise to the relationship of employer and employee, and where the employee came under the direction and control of the person to whom his services had been furnished, the latter became his temporary employer and liable for compensation in the event of injury or death.

         Compensation was allowable when the injury arose out of the nature of the employment, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment but was not allowable if the accident was to be regarded as arising out of an “act of living.” Harrison v.

    A claimant must not only prove she was injured, but she must also prove that the injury was caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment. Kiger v. Idaho Corp., 85 Idaho 424, 380 P.2d 208 (1963).

         An injury was received in the course of the employment when it came while the workman was doing the duty which he was employed to perform; it arose out of the employment when there was apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work was required to be performed and the resulting injury; therefore, if the injury could have been seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and would have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arose out of the employment, but it excluded an injury which could not have been fairly traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which came from a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. Kiger v. Idaho Corp., 85 Idaho 424, 380 P.2d 208 (1963).

    Where deceased was employed by defendant to haul logs in truck of deceased at a stipulated rate, with a minimum guarantee, death of the employee while crossing railroad tracks in truck on his way to work, was not compensable, though truck was used in his work.

         Even though an employee temporarily departed from his usual employment, if he did so to do some act necessary to be done by someone for his employer, or did whatever a human being might reasonably do while in the performance of his duty at the time when he was injured, he did not then cease to be acting in the course of his employment. In re MacKenzie, 54 Idaho 481, 33 P.2d 113 (1934).
        </p>
        <p>
         If an employee leaves his place of employment and goes to another place in close proximity thereto, merely as an observer and to satisfy his curiosity, then he would not reasonably be fulfilling any of the duties of his employment or doing something incidental to it, and would not be, if injured while on such venture, entitled to compensation. But not every slight deviation from an employee’s duty will deprive him, or, in case of his death, his dependents, of the right to compensation. In re MacKenzie, 54 Idaho 481, 33 P.2d 113 (1934).

         An injury to an employee while he was attempting to start an automobile on the employer’s premises at noon, preparatory to going home for his lunch, did not arise out of, and in the course of, employment so as to be compensable. Neale v. Weaver, 60 Idaho 41, 88 P.2d 522 (1939).

        <p>
         Where an employee’s condition was brought about by the breathing of silica dust rock, which was injurious to his lungs, causing the development of tuberculosis, this was sufficient evidence to sustain a holding that the employee was injured as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. Beaver v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 55 Idaho 275, 41 P.2d 605 (1935).
        </p>
        <p>
         Death of employee from silicosis was compensable. Brown v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 49, 87 P.2d 1000 (1938); Nixon v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 64, 87 P.2d 1007 (1938).
        </p>

         Silicosis was not an occupational disease, as an “occupational disease” was one which inhered in the particular employment and could not have been prevented by reasonable means. Brown v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 49, 87 P.2d 1000 (1939).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a proceeding to recover compensation for an employee’s death as alleged result of silicosis contracted while employed as miner, where there was no showing that employer furnished, and the employee used, dry drills prohibited by statute, or that there was a sudden “blowing up” due to lethal, latent or dormant tuberculosis, or otherwise, the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was justified in finding that the death was caused by occupational disease, and hence not compensable under the workmen’s compensation act. Foote v. Hecla Mining Co., 62 Idaho 79, 108 P.2d 1030 (1940).
        </p>
        <p>
         Silicosis, contracted by miners while working underground, was not an “occupational disease” under the statute, but was compensable, although the mining company had put wet drilling equipment into general use in the mines, where the mines were not provided with any mechanical ventilation and the company did not install exhaust pipes or filters and did not provide masks for underground workers. Howard v. Texas Owyhee Mining & Dev. Co., 62 Idaho 707, 115 P.2d 749 (1941).

        </p>
        <p>
         Silicosis was not compensable as an accident, where evidence showed disease was not due to a sudden onslaught, but was due to a gradual exposure over a period of years. Shumaker v. Hunter Lease & Gold Hunter Mines, 72 Idaho 173, 238 P.2d 425 (1951).
        </p>
        <p>
         Claimant in order to recover compensation for silicosis disability must have proven (1) that he was totally disabled from uncomplicated silicosis, or (2) that he was totally disabled as a result of silicosis complicated by tuberculosis of the lungs, and that silicosis was an essential factor in causing the disability. Davis v. Sunshine Mining Co., 73 Idaho 94, 245 P.2d 822 (1952); Flasche v. Bunker Hill Co., 83 Idaho 420, 363 P.2d 1024 (1961); Stockdale v. Sunshine Mining Co., 84 Idaho 506, 373 P.2d 935 (1962).

    Since passage of occupational disease law disability as result of silicosis could not be considered an accidental injury. Peterson v. Sunset Minerals, Inc., 75 Idaho 354, 272 P.2d 692 (1954).

        <p>
         Where collapse of lung was due partly to silicosis along with other nonoccupational diseases, the collapse of the lung was not an accidental injury, and there could be no recovery of compensation for an accidental injury but recovery was restricted to amount allowed under occupational disease law.

        </p>
        <p>
         Under the workmen’s compensation law, the duties and liabilities of a surety were prescribed by statute, and the statutory provision became a part of the contract, whether given by surety company or state insurance fund, and the injured workman or legal representatives were authorized to prosecute a separate or independent claim against a surety.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The common law system governing the remedy of workmen against employers for injuries received and occupational diseases contracted in industrial and public work is inconsistent with modern industrial conditions. The welfare of the state depends upon its industries and even more upon the welfare of its wageworkers. The state of Idaho, therefore, exercising herein its police and sovereign power, declares that all phases of the premises are withdrawn from private controversy, and sure and certain relief for injured workmen and their families and dependents is hereby provided regardless of questions of fault and to the exclusion of every other remedy, proceeding or compensation, except as is otherwise provided in this act, and to that end all civil actions and civil causes of action for such personal injuries and all jurisdiction of the courts of the state over such causes are hereby abolished, except as is in this law provided.

        The purpose of enacting the workmen’s compensation laws in Idaho was to provide sure relief for injured workers and their dependents. In providing for the payment of attorney’s fees in certain cases, the legislature sought to further this purpose in several ways; first, the legislature sought to encourage claimants to press claims which, but for such provision, would not be worth their time and effort once the costs of hiring of attorney had been deducted from the award; and second, the legislature meant to encourage attorneys to represent clients and take on claims which would otherwise not be in their best financial interests due to their relative financial insignificance. Hogaboom v. Economy Mattress, 107 Idaho 13, 684 P.2d 990 (1984).
    There is no authority for the award of attorney fees against a worker’s compensation claimant who unsuccessfully appeals a decision. Swanson v. Kraft, Inc., 116 Idaho 315, 775 P.2d 629 (1989).

       <p>
        This section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-211" target="_self">§ 72-211 </a></cite>vest exclusive jurisdiction over claims for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment in the industrial commission; accordingly, the district court properly dismissed an employee’s claim for damages allegedly induced by and during his employment filed directly with the circuit court. Henderson v. State, 110 Idaho 308, 715 P.2d 978, cert. denied, 477 U.S. 907, 106 S. Ct. 3282, 91 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1986).

        Where the employee was injured when her foot was partially severed by a lawn mower she was operating because the employer did not use the proper engine or safety devices on the lawn mower, but there was no evidence presented to the trial court that the employer wilfully or without provocation physically attacked the employee, there was no genuine issue of material fact, and the trial court was justified in granting summary judgment against the employee in a civil action against the employer for injuries caused by an intentional tort of the employer during the course of employment, since workmen’s compensation provided an exclusive remedy under the circumstances. Kearney v. Denker, 114 Idaho 755, 760 P.2d 1171 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In granting summary judgment for the company, whose manager engaged in sexual intercourse with a minor employee, the district court had concluded that the minor suffered an injury, a broken hymen, caused by an accident at work. However, a ruptured hymen was not “an unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap, or untoward event”; it was something that typically occurred when a virgin engaged in sexual intercourse. Consequently, since there was no accident as defined by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>(17)(b), the minor did not suffer a personal injury, as defined by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>(17)(c), and her tort claims were not preempted by the exclusivity provisions of the Idaho worker’s compensation act. Roe v. Albertson’s, Inc., 141 Idaho 524, 112 P.3d 812 (2005).
    Although family members of an employee were entitled to (and did receive) worker’s compensation benefits for the employee’s death, the district court erred by finding that the members’ wrongful death action was barred by the exclusivity rule under the worker’s compensation law. The court failed to consider whether the employer consciously disregarded information suggesting a significant risk to its employees working at or under tables, and, on remand, was to apply the proper standard for proving an act of unprovoked physical aggression.

        Since worker’s compensation statutes must be considered in the context of the entire act, the court held that it was clear the legislature intended, in order for the worker’s compensation law to achieve its purpose of providing sure and certain relief for injured workers and their families, that all claims, issues and civil actions relating in any manner to the injury of a worker be decided by the industrial commission.

        In a wrongful death action, the trial court’s denial of defendant’s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, both of which were made upon the ground that the industrial commission had exclusive jurisdiction of the matter, did not remove the question of the applicability of workmen’s compensation law from the proceedings, and thus the trial court did not err in carrying that issue forward to trial. Anderson v. Gailey, 97 Idaho 813, 555 P.2d 144 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the industrial commission and the district court had concurrent jurisdiction to determine whether they had jurisdiction to consider the claim or hear the case, where a notice of injury was filed with the commission before plaintiffs filed their original complaint with the district court, then the commission had the first right to determine the jurisdictional issue and its determination is res judicata upon that question. Anderson v. Gailey, 97 Idaho 813, 555 P.2d 144 (1976).

        In a wrongful death action, the determination of whether the decedent had been an employee of defendant, rather than an independent contractor or a casual employee, while engaged in making repairs to broken equipment at the bottom of a drill shaft, was a question of fact for the jury, for the question bore not only upon the issue of the court’s jurisdiction but also upon the standard of care that defendant owed to the decedent.

        To recover in a separate action against an employer, a plaintiff must allege the existence of a tort not covered by the workmen’s compensation statute. Yeend v. UPS, Inc., 104 Idaho 333, 659 P.2d 87 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the only allegation of wrongdoing on the part of the employer was the allegation that supervisor twice directed claimant to continue working after she informed him that she had been injured in a fall, the claim for emotional distress resulting therefrom did not constitute a separate tort of outrage compensable under a common-law action for intentional infliction of emotional distress; any such claim, to the extent that it constituted a neurosis or other psychological condition traceable in part to an industrial accident and injury was compensable only under the workmen’s compensation scheme. Yeend v. UPS, Inc., 104 Idaho 333, 659 P.2d 87 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The filing of a worker’s compensation claim does not constitute a waiver by the employee of the right to attempt to prove that the injury was caused by the wilful or unprovoked physical aggression of the employer and to maintain a civil action against the employer for injuries that were allegedly caused by an intentional tort of the employer during the course of employment. Kearney v. Denker, 114 Idaho 755, 760 P.2d 1171 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prove aggression sufficient to maintain an action against the employer for injury caused by the wilful or unprovoked physical aggression of the employer, there must be evidence of some offensive action or hostile attack; it is not sufficient to prove that the alleged aggressor committed negligent acts that made it substantially certain that injury would occur. Kearney v. Denker, 114 Idaho 755, 760 P.2d 1171 (1988).

        In construing this statute the cardinal rule is to ascertain intention of legislature as expressed in words of statute, and for this purpose act must be considered as a whole. Workmen’s Comp.

        The purpose of the law was to provide sure relief for injured workmen and their dependents. McNeil v. Panhandle Lumber Co., 34 Idaho 773, 203 P. 1068 (1921); In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Entire law manifested purpose on part of legislature, under its police power, to require every industry to bear burden cast upon working class because of personal injuries occasioned by accidents that were incident of occupation, insofar as same may have been compensated by pecuniary consideration. All of its provisions, including procedure to enforce same, should have been considered in view of this purpose and all contracts of indemnity to injured or their dependents when death ensued, should have been so construed insofar as reasonable construction of agreement permitted. Hauter v. Coeur d’Alene Antimony Mining Co., 39 Idaho 621, 228 P. 259 (1923).
    The purpose of the workmen’s compensation law was to secure compensation for employees disabled, in whole or in part, from earning the support of themselves and their dependents, payable because of, and during the period of their disability, also to secure compensation for the dependents of employees who have been killed by accident, arising out of and in the course of their employment. There was nothing to be found in the law to indicate a legislative intention to provide for compensation for an employee because of an accident which had not resulted in injury causing disability, nor for payment of compensation covering a period of time when the employee was not disabled. McRae v. School Dist. No. 23, 56 Idaho 384, 55 P.2d 724 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute was a declaration of police power providing for compensation for industrial injuries, caused without fault on the part of the employer, regardless of the fellow-servant rule, assumption of risk, or contributory negligence. Arneson v. Robinson, 59 Idaho 223, 82 P.2d 249 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The compensation law provided a special remedy unknown to the common law, and the act itself deprived the workman of his common-law rights, and provided indemnities in lieu thereof. Close v. General Constr. Co., 61 Idaho 689, 106 P.2d 1007 (1940); Stample v. Idaho Power Co., 92 Idaho 763, 450 P.2d 610 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Theoretically, the workmen’s compensation law was not intended to provide for payment of damages to injured workmen, but only to compensate for loss of earning power. Olson v. Union Pac. R.R., 62 Idaho 423, 112 P.2d 1005 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The administration of the workmen’s compensation law and benefits accruing thereunder to workmen and employees was a fixed principle of the policy of the state. Stover v. Washington County, 63 Idaho 145, 118 P.2d 63 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workmen’s compensation was not meant or intended as life or health insurance, it was purely accident and occupational disease insurance. Wade v. Pacific Coast Elevator Co., 64 Idaho 176, 129 P.2d 894 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the purpose of the law to make the industry carry the burden of loss caused by injuries to workmen, but the employer, not the industry, was liable. Moon v. Ervin, 64 Idaho 464, 133 P.2d 933 (1943); Frisk v. Garrett Freightlines, Inc., 76 Idaho 27, 276 P.2d 964 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the workmen’s compensation law was to provide not only for employees a remedy which was both expeditious and independent of proof of fault, but also for employers a liability which was limited and determinative. Stample v. Idaho Power Co., 92 Idaho 763, 450 P.2d 610 (1969).

       </p>
       <p>
        While compensation did not depend on negligence on the part of the employer, his negligence did not exclude, but compelled compensation. Brown v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 49, 87 P.2d 1000 (1938); Howard v. Texas Owyhee Mining & Dev. Co., 62 Idaho 707, 115 P.2d 749 (1941).
    The workmen’s compensation act was remedial and special law providing compensation for injured employees without referring to negligence on the part of either employer or employee. Lebak v. Nelson, 62 Idaho 96, 107 P.2d 1054 (1940); Gifford v. Nottingham, 68 Idaho 330, 193 P.2d 831 (1948).

       </p>
       <p>
        While compensation did not depend upon negligence of the employer, his negligence contributing to the injury of an employee would bar his subrogation action against a third party tortfeasor. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Adams, 91 Idaho 151, 417 P.2d 417 (1966).

        Where, after injury, employee was further injured by doctor employed by employer’s compensation insurance carrier while undergoing examination for carrier’s benefit, he had no right of action against the insurance carrier unless such injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment and was not compensable under Idaho workmen’s compensation act, or injury was sustained under circumstances as to create liability in one other than his employer.

        The law was purely statutory and, was an expressed departure from the common law, explicitly doing away with common-law actions previously applicable to such controversies. Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho 264, 220 P. 1088 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        The workmen’s compensation law withdrew every phase of the controversy for compensation from the operation of the common-law rules. In re Fisk, 40 Idaho 304, 232 P. 569 (1925); Haugse v. Sommers Bros. Mfg. Co., 43 Idaho 450, 254 P. 212 (1927); State Ins. Fund v. Hunt, 52 Idaho 639, 17 P.2d 354 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        By the enactment of the workmen’s compensation act, the legislature intended to give the injured workman a speedy, summary and simple remedy for the recovery of compensation in all cases coming within its provisions, that strict rules of procedure were not required, and that in every case where compensation was not settled by agreement, the board, or a member thereof to whom the matter had been assigned, should have made such inquiries and investigations as should have been deemed proper. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937).
       </p>

        In abolishing all civil actions and remedies, the legislature made it clear that the procedure before the board was not governed by the Civil Practice Act. O’Niel v. Madison Lumber & Mill Co., 61 Idaho 546, 105 P.2d 194 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        In enacting the workmen’s compensation law abolishing every remedy for all injuries received by a workman in the course of his employment, the legislature did not intend to take from the workman his common-law remedy for the negligent act of his employer resulting in serious injury and damage to the workman, and give the workman no other remedy in lieu thereof, and would be deemed to have assumed that every injury would impair the workman’s usefulness to some degree, and that a workman should in some measure be compensated under the new remedy set up by the compensation law. Olson v. Union Pac. R.R., 62 Idaho 423, 112 P.2d 1005 (1941).
    Although the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was a tribunal of limited scope, it had general and exclusive original jurisdiction in the state field of industrial accidents. Johnson v. Falen, 65 Idaho 542, 149 P.2d 228 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] had exclusive jurisdiction of claim for injuries sustained by a minor aged 15 while working for a lumber company. Lockard v. St. Maries Lumber Co., 76 Idaho 506, 285 P.2d 473 (1955).
       </p>

        As third party was the loaned servant of the trucking company for the purpose of aiding in the unloading of boilers he was transporting at the time of the accident and injury to plaintiff, accident occurring while third party was driving truck out from under boiler as it was being elevated under direction of plaintiff, plaintiff’s exclusive remedy was compensation under the workmen’s compensation law. Cloughley v. Orange Transp. Co., 80 Idaho 226, 327 P.2d 369 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        A state employee injured by a state-owned truck driven by a co-employee was precluded from bringing a damage action against the state and said co-employee for such injuries. Nichols v. Godfrey, 90 Idaho 345, 411 P.2d 763 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The enactment of the workmen’s compensation laws did not abolish all common-law causes of action between the actual employer (subcontractor) and the statutory employer (general contractor) of an injured workman. Industrial Indem. Co. v. Columbia Basin Steel & Iron, Inc., 93 Idaho 719, 471 P.2d 574 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since workmen’s compensation is the exclusive remedy provided an employee against his employer for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, once the employer-employee relationship is shown to exist any common lawsuit against the employer is barred, even though the employer may be negligent in regard to the duty of safety owed to an employee. Provo v. Bunker Hill Co., 393 F. Supp. 778 (D. Idaho 1975).

       <p>
        Two classes of employers were covered by the workmen’s compensation act; one was the normal common-law type of employer and the other was an employer as defined by the statute. Beedy v. Washington Water Power Co., 238 F.2d 123 (9th Cir. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the statute provided that the act should apply “to all private employment not expressly excepted by the provisions,” the court would not restrict its coverage by construction in cases where such restriction was not fairly required by the terms of the act itself. Collins v. Moyle, 83 Idaho 151, 358 P.2d 1035 (1961).

        Idaho has recognized a well-established common law rule that where one is requested by an employee to assist in doing such employee’s work in the furtherance of the business of the master, and such assistant does such work with the knowledge and acquiescence of the employer, such assistant thereby becomes, in effect, an employee. Wise v. Armold Transf. & Storage Co., 109 Idaho 20, 704 P.2d 352 (Ct. App. 1985).

        Where the plaintiff’s work as an assistant to a truck driver, helping in loading and unloading, involved a small portion of time compared to the amount of time consumed in traveling, for which he was not compensated, such work did not constitute “casual employment” within the meaning of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-212" target="_self">§ 72-212</a></cite>(2), since the employment of the plaintiff did not arise inadvertently or at uncertain times, and the work was an integral part of the employer’s business; thus, the plaintiff was an employee within the meaning of subdivision (2) of this section, being an assistant to an employee, and thus was precluded from bringing a personal injury action by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-211" target="_self">§ 72-211</a></cite>, providing that workmen’s compensation is the exclusive remedy.

        In determining statutory employer status, consideration should be given to such elements as ownership of the premises, proprietorship, virtual proprietorship, management of the business, and source of the payment of workmen’s compensation premiums.

       </p>
       <p>
        Commonly, the statutory employer pays the premiums covering his or her employees, since it is the employer’s legal responsibility to insure that employees are covered by workmen’s compensation insurance. Rhodes v. Sunshine Mining Co., 113 Idaho 162, 742 P.2d 417 (1987).

        The inquiry with regard to cases involving an accident where the claimant was on business but also performing a personal errand is whether the departure from the claimant’s employment became so personal that it broke the causal connection to such an extent that the resulting accident could no longer be said to “arise out of and in the course of” the claimant’s employment.

        This section was amended by two 1990 acts, ch. 301, § 1, effective April 5, 1990, and ch. 335, § 2, effective July 1, 1990, which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both 1990 amendments redesignated former subsection (6) as subsection (7), and added a subsection (8). The subsection (8) added by ch. 301, § 1 has been compiled as subsection (8), and the subsection (8) added by ch. 335, § 2, has been compiled as subsection [9](8).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 90, substituted the first occurrence of “worker’s” for “workmen’s” in subsection (7); and corrected the designation of the last paragraph.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 369, in subsection (4), substituted “a volunteer emergency responder” for “a member of a volunteer fire or police department,” and inserted “agency or organization.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 42, deleted “with the state insurance fund” from the end of subsection (9).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 46, added “or by the Idaho higher education policy” at the end of subsection (9).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 39, added “when the work experience student is not covered by the private or governmental entity that is the student’s work experience employer” at the end of subsection (9).

    The worker’s compensation law does not deny the equal protection of the laws to an employee who is intentionally injured on the job by the employer as both this section, denying compensation to an employee who wilfully intends to injure herself, and subsection (3) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-209" target="_self">§ 72-209</a></cite>, providing coverage for the injury of an employee caused by the negligent acts of an employer that made it substantially certain that an injury would occur, require an intention to injure the employee.

        A blood alcohol level of .117 percent was not sufficiently high to overcome the presumption contained in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-228" target="_self">§ 72-228 </a></cite>that employee’s death was not occasioned by his intoxication.

        At hearing before the commission on claimant’s application for full income benefits as the surviving widow of employee who was killed when his semi-truck overturned, the expert testimony of a toxicologist regarding the effect of employee’s .117 percent blood alcohol level on his ability to operate a motor vehicle was not necessarily binding on the commission which could have concluded that all of the evidence of employee’s intoxication did not overcome statutory presumption that employee’s death was not caused by his intoxication. Hatley v. Lewiston Grain Growers, Inc., 97 Idaho 719, 552 P.2d 482 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In hearings on claimant’s application for full income benefits as surviving widow of employee who was killed when his semi-truck overturned, the commission did not err in its conclusion that there was a lack of substantial evidence in the record that employee’s death was caused by intoxication, even though test results revealed that decedent had .117 percent blood alcohol level, where truck stop proprietors testified that employee’s behavior was normal and that he did not appear to be intoxicated.

        This section does not eliminate the requirement that the claimant must show that an accident arose “out of and in the course of” the claimant’s employment, but rather, this section provides that if a claimant is otherwise eligible for benefits and the injury is the proximate result of the claimant’s intoxication, the claimant’s benefits shall be reduced by 50 percent; the section does not create any entitlement to compensation if the claimant is not otherwise eligible for that compensation under the rubric of the workers’ compensation statutes.

        The death of an employee as the result of being shot by his employer while at work, due to personal animosity, as the result of the employer and the employee dating the same woman, was not compensable though there was evidence that employer was an alcohol paranoiac, since the shooting was the result of a premeditated act.

        The industrial accident board’s ultimate finding that decedent, at the time of his accidental death, was returning home after a social evening with friends and not from a mission for his employer was substantiated by the evidence where representative of company with whom decedent’s employer had a local sales franchise had not expected decedent’s visit and any tenuous connection with employment in the earlier part of the evening had long ended, the major portion of such evening being spent in social activities and the consumption of liquor.

        The employee who, at the time of the accident, was in his vehicle in the company parking lot on his way to lunch when he collided with co-employee, was acting within the course of his employment, and therefore he was entitled to co-employee immunity pursuant to this section.

Dominguez v. Evergreen Res., Inc., 142 Idaho 7, 121 P.3d 938 (2005).

        Generally speaking, an accident is deemed not to be in the course of employment if it occurs while the employee is on his way to work and has not yet reached the employer’s premises, or while the employee is on his way home and has left the employer’s premises. This general rule is predicated upon the fact that the employee usually selects the particular way, means and conveyance for going to and from work, and thus is himself in control of the risk. However, an exception to the general rule is when the employee is going and returning in some transportation facility furnished by the employer, for the employer, by taking control of the trip to and from work, has extended the risks of employment and therefore has extended the course of employment. Hansen v. Estate of Harvey, 119 Idaho 357, 806 P.2d 450 (Ct. App. 1990).

       <p>
        Where employees were riding in employer-provided transportation when the accident occurred, at that time, the employer had extended the risks of employment to include transportation, and the course of employment had been extended commensurately, thus worker’s compensation provided the exclusive remedy and a tort suit against the employer and against the fellow employee’s estate was barred by this section.

        Where third party paid consideration for release of any claim employer may have had, based on the accident, employer’s subrogation rights were extinguished and third party became subrogated to employer’s right of reimbursement. Thus, in the event employer’s negligence was litigated, and employer was found not negligent, third party held employer’s right to be reimbursed for the workmen’s compensation benefits paid; conversely, in the event employer was found negligent, third party retained its right to receive a credit towards his judgment, in the amount of the workmen’s compensation benefits paid.

        The penalty statute does not require the claimant to make a claim under this section in order to receive an award thereunder. Claimant need only make a claim for compensation in order to be eligible for an award under this section. Once that claim is made, it is the commission’s right and obligation to make the additional award against an employer who has failed to secure payment. Mortimer v. Riviera Apts., 122 Idaho 839, 840 P.2d 383 (1992).

        This section bears a rational relationship to the legitimate legislative purpose of providing “sure and certain relief” for an injured worker and his family enunciated as policy in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-201" target="_self">§ 72-201</a></cite>; accordingly, it does not violate any state or federal due process provisions. Heese v. A &amp; T Trucking, 102 Idaho 598, 635 P.2d 962 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this section provides no suspect, “near” suspect, or invidiously discriminatory classification, and entangles no fundamental or “quasi” fundamental right, it must be tested under the “rational basis” test for violations of the state and federal equal protection clauses; because the legislature imposed a statutory penalty without regard to fault in every case where the employee’s recovery is at risk by virtue of the employer’s failure to secure payment of compensation, which is a rational way to insure “sure and certain relief” as envisioned by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-201" target="_self">§ 72-201</a></cite>, the section does not create a special class of employers who have not provided security for compensation so as to deny equal protection to them. Heese v. A &amp; T Trucking, 102 Idaho 598, 635 P.2d 962 (1981).
    The term “employer” is not unconstitutionally vague. The statutory definition in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>(11) [now (13)] is sufficient to inform an ordinary person whether he falls within the term “employer.” Mortimer v.

        Where a claimant retains counsel pursuant to a contingent fee agreement and the industrial commission is required to award attorney’s fees by this section, the commission must base its award on what would be a reasonable fee on a contingent basis.

        In determining statutory employer status, consideration should be given to such elements as ownership of the premises, proprietorship, virtual proprietorship, management of the business, and source of the payment of workmen’s compensation premiums.

       <p>
        Where notice for hearing stated that the purpose of the hearing was to “determine the amount of benefits to which claimant is entitled,” the industrial commission’s use of the term “benefits” in the notice was sufficient to give employer notice pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-713" target="_self">§ 72-713 </a></cite>that the applicability of this section was at issue.

        The industrial commission did not err in concluding that an employer failing to secure payment of compensation as required by the workers’ compensation act is strictly liable for the statutory penalty imposed by this section, since this section is unambiguous and requires no showing of bad faith or scienter as a prerequisite to the imposition of the ten percent surcharge, costs or attorney fees.

        When the employee was employed by two employers and one employer was attempting to use the workers’ compensation law as a shield to avoid third-party liability, it was that employer’s duty to prove that the employee was working for the employer when the accident occurred and the fact that the employee was subject to the direction and control of either employer at moment’s notice was not determinative; what the employer had to prove as claimant was that the employee’s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment with the employer.

        Although the industrial commission and the district court had concurrent jurisdiction to determine whether they had jurisdiction to consider the claim or hear the case, where a notice of injury was filed with the commission before plaintiffs filed their original complaint with the district court, then the commission had the first right to determine the jurisdictional issue and its determination is res judicata upon that question.

        In a wrongful death action, the determination of whether the decedent had been an employee of defendant, rather than an independent contractor or a casual employee, while engaged in making repairs to broken equipment at the bottom of a drill shaft, was a question of fact for the jury, for the question bore not only upon the issue of the court’s jurisdiction but also upon the standard of care that defendant owed to the decedent.

        In granting summary judgment for the company, whose manager engaged in sexual intercourse with a minor employee, the district court had concluded that the minor suffered an injury, a broken hymen, caused by an accident at work. However, a ruptured hymen was not “an unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap, or untoward event”; it was something that typically occurred when a virgin engaged in sexual intercourse. Consequently, since there was no accident, as defined by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>(17)(b) [now (18)(b)], the minor did not suffer a personal injury, as defined by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>(17)(c) [now (18)(c)], and her tort claims were not preempted by the exclusivity provisions of the Idaho worker’s compensation act.

       <p>
        Although family members of an employee were entitled to (and did receive) worker’s compensation benefits for the employee’s death, the district court erred by finding that the members’ wrongful death action was barred by the exclusivity rule under the worker’s compensation law. The court failed to consider whether the employer consciously disregarded information suggesting a significant risk to its employees working at or under tables, and, on remand, was to apply the proper standard for proving an act of unprovoked physical aggression.

    Where the only allegation of wrongdoing on the part of the employer was the allegation that supervisor twice directed claimant to continue working after she informed him that she had been injured in a fall, the claim for emotional distress resulting therefrom did not constitute a separate tort of outrage compensable under a common-law action for intentional infliction of emotional distress; any such claim, to the extent that it constituted a neurosis or other psychological condition traceable in part to an industrial accident and injury was compensable only under the workmen’s compensation scheme.

        In a wrongful death action, the determination of whether the decedent had been an employee of defendant, rather than an independent contractor or a casual employee, while engaged in making repairs to broken equipment at the bottom of a drill shaft, was a question of fact for the jury, for the question bore not only upon the issue of the court’s jurisdiction but also upon the standard of care that defendant owed to the decedent. Anderson v. Gailey, 97 Idaho 813, 555 P.2d 144 (1976).

        Casual employment includes only that employment which arises occasionally or incidentally or which comes at uncertain times or at irregular intervals. Tuma v. Kosterman, 106 Idaho 728, 682 P.2d 1275 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff’s work as an assistant to a truck driver, helping in loading and unloading, involved a small portion of time compared to the amount of time consumed in traveling, for which he was not compensated, such work did not constitute “casual employment” within the meaning of subdivision (2) of this section, since the employment of the plaintiff did not arise inadvertently or at uncertain times, and the work was an integral part of the employer’s business. Wise v. Armold Transf. & Storage Co., 109 Idaho 20, 704 P.2d 352 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Daily work of a workmen’s compensation claimant who fed dogs and cleaned kennels for a dog breeder was held to be an integral part of employer’s business and was neither occasional, incidental, irregular, nor at uncertain times and hence did not fall within the “casual employment” exception. Partello v. Stipa, 115 Idaho 522, 768 P.2d 785 (1989).

       <p>
        Casual employment is defined as employment that is only occasional, or comes at uncertain times, or at irregular intervals, and whose happening cannot be reasonably anticipated as certain or likely to occur or to become necessary; it is employment that arises only occasionally or incidentally and is not part of the usual trade or business of the employer. Larson v. Bonneville Pac. Servs. Co., 117 Idaho 988, 793 P.2d 220 (1990).

       <p>
        Where the record showed that claimant was employed by company that maintains and operates power plants and was employed for the sole task of replanting trees; that this task was to be accomplished in two to three weeks; that neither employer nor claimant anticipated that claimant would ever be employed again by employer; that the need for reforestation and revegetation occurs, if at all, at uncertain times or at irregular intervals, and its happening cannot be reasonably anticipated as likely to occur or become necessary; and that revegetation was not the regular business of employer, the record demonstrated substantial and competent evidence to support the commission’s finding that employee’s employment was casual. Larson v. Bonneville Pac. Servs. Co., 117 Idaho 988, 793 P.2d 220 (1990).
    Defendant, a physical therapy employer, was not liable under the state’s worker’s compensation law, since the plaintiff/employee fell within the casual employment exemption in subsection (2): his payment was not typical of a permanent or regular employee and he maintained primary control over his own employment.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employer is engaged in both a covered occupation and an exempt occupation, a special employee employed to work exclusively in the covered occupation is covered; thus, since a horse farm owner was involved in two business activities, horse breeding and horse racing, and since horse racing is a covered occupation, the injured claimant who was employed to work exclusively in this enterprise, was also covered for purposes of workmen’s compensation.

        Agricultural Pursuits.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Agricultural pursuits was a broader term than agricultural labor and may have properly included every process and step taken and necessary to the completion of a finished farm product. Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho 264, 220 P. 1088 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Operation of commercial threshing machine outfit is an agricultural pursuit. Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho 264, 220 P. 1088 (1923); Hubble v. Perrault, 78 Idaho 448, 304 P.2d 1092 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employee in agricultural pursuit was injured before employer had elected to have act apply thereto, he was not entitled to protection hereunder. Kindall v. McBirney, 52 Idaho 65, 11 P.2d 370 (1932); Gloubitz v. Smeed Bros., 53 Idaho 7, 21 P.2d 78 (1933); Crowley v. Idaho Indus. Training Sch., 53 Idaho 606, 26 P.2d 180 (1933); Dorrell v. Norida Land & Timber Co., 53 Idaho 793, 27 P.2d 960 (1933); Mundell v. Swedlund, 59 Idaho 29, 80 P.2d 13 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agricultural pursuit did not include commercial delivery of horses, because it was not work carried on by the particular employer, a sales stockyard operator, as an agricultural pursuit on open ranges or in enclosed fields. Gloubitz v. Smeed Bros., 53 Idaho 7, 21 P.2d 78 (1933); Smythe v. Phoenix, 63 Idaho 585, 123 P.2d 1010 (1942).
    In connection with what constitutes an agricultural pursuit within the meaning of the workmen’s compensation law, such law was construed liberally. Dorrell v. Norida Land & Timber Co., 53 Idaho 793, 27 P.2d 960 (1933); Mundell v. Swedlund, 59 Idaho 29, 80 P.2d 13 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence was clear and undisputed that, with the exception of perhaps a couple of hours on the day of the accident, the deceased devoted all of his time to and earned his livelihood by (when employed by his employer) performing the duties of a watchman and the work and labor of general utility man, this supports findings and judgment that at the time of the accident, resulting in his death, he was not engaged in agricultural pursuit and his dependents were entitled to compensation. Dorrell v. Norida Land & Timber Co., 53 Idaho 793, 27 P.2d 960 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        A workman was not a farm laborer and therefore was not engaged in agricultural pursuit simply because at the moment he was doing work on a farm, but rather, the nature of all of the duties he discharged were looked to to determine whether or not he was classified as engaged in an agricultural pursuit. Mundell v. Swedlund, 59 Idaho 29, 80 P.2d 13 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence shows there were but two hay cutters in the community, and but a limited quantity of hay ground, and that commercially in the greater part that it had been the employer’s custom from year to year to go about from farm to farm grinding hay at a contract price, this was sufficient to require a finding that neither the employer nor the employee were engaged in farming or performance of farm labor as generally understood. They were engaged in a special work, not ordinarily done by farmers, — a business or industrial pursuit in and of itself, entirely separate and apart from farming, and they did not come within the provision of the compensation law pertaining to agricultural pursuit. Mundell v. Swedlund, 59 Idaho 29, 80 P.2d 13 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The delivery of peaches, necessitating a trip of several hundred miles, by a truck driver for his employer, a fruit grower and dealer, who did not raise such peaches but purchased them for resale, was not “agricultural employment” within the exception from coverage of the workmen’s compensation act. Mulanix v. Falen, 64 Idaho 293, 130 P.2d 866 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of whether deceased employee was engaged in industrial work and covered by the compensation act or whether his work was agricultural and not covered was a question of fact for the industrial board to determine. Reed v. Russell, 67 Idaho 84, 172 P.2d 853 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant who was injured while unloading logs from employer’s farm at the mill was not entitled to compensation where employer had not elected to come under the workmen’s compensation act, since work performed at the time of the injury was incidental to farming operation of the employer. Bartlett v. Darrah, 76 Idaho 460, 285 P.2d 138 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant was hired to perform exclusively agricultural labor in an agricultural pursuit and was engaged in such pursuit at the time of the accident, he being struck by a truck while pitching pea vines into a threshing machine, regardless of the fact that his employer was also engaged in processing business, a covered employment, such employee hired exclusively to work in the exempt occupation was not covered. Hubble v. Perrault, 78 Idaho 448, 304 P.2d 1092 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term livestock had reference to and included domestic animals ordinarily found upon farms and public ranges and not to wild life raised in captivity; therefore, claimant who worked as a laborer on mink farm was engaged in covered employment. Collins v. Moyle, 83 Idaho 151, 358 P.2d 1035 (1961).
    While the court may properly have considered federal acts and decisions and the decisions of other states in determining what constituted an “agricultural pursuit” or a definition of “livestock” where its meaning was in doubt, it was not at liberty to amend the compensation act by incorporating therein the exceptions specifically set out in federal acts or the Idaho employment security act. Collins v. Moyle, 83 Idaho 151, 358 P.2d 1035 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that legislature had amended this section since the adoption in the federal law and the Idaho employment security act of a definition of livestock which included wild and furbearing animals without broadening the definition of livestock herein to include such animals must have been construed as a refusal of the legislature to broaden the exemption from workmen’s compensation coverage. Collins v. Moyle, 83 Idaho 151, 358 P.2d 1035 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The operator of a tractor in plowing and seeding pursuant to a contract whereby the employer engaged to plow and seed in crested wheat 2100 acres of federal land for the bureau of land management of the department of the interior was engaged in an agricultural pursuit within the meaning of the statute. Reedy v. Trummell, 90 Idaho 318, 410 P.2d 654 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        A horse trainer employed by a corporation engaged in the business of raising, breeding, training, boarding, and selling race horses was not employed in an agricultural pursuit within the meaning of the statute. Manning v. Win Her Stables, Inc., 91 Idaho 549, 428 P.2d 55 (1967).

        Burden of Proof.

       <p>
        Employer claiming exemption has burden of proof. Gloubitz v. Smeed Bros., 53 Idaho 7, 21 P.2d 78 (1933). But see Arbogast v. Jerome Co-op. Creamery, 65 Idaho 556, 149 P.2d 230 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        After the workman established the employer-employee relationship, the employer had the burden of proving his exemption and employer met the burden by presenting proof that employer did not build the house for pecuniary gain or for a business related purpose. Lynskey v. Lind, 94 Idaho 788, 498 P.2d 1261 (1972).

       <h5 id="t72c02s72-212-Cited-casualemployment">
        Casual Employment.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The word “casual” applied to the employment, and not to the employee, and time had confirmed the wisdom of the conclusion, early arrived at by the English authorities, that no hard-and-fast definition of the term “casual” was advisable, and that each case must be decided quite largely upon its own special facts. Flynn v. Carson, 42 Idaho 141, 243 P. 818 (1926); Dillard v. Jones, 58 Idaho 273, 72 P.2d 705 (1937); Rabideau v. Cramer, 59 Idaho 154, 81 P.2d 403 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion was of “casual employment” not necessarily “casual employee”; not those persons but those employments which were casual, were necessarily excluded. Flynn v. Carson, 42 Idaho 141, 243 P. 818 (1926); Orr v. Boise Cold Storage Co., 52 Idaho 151, 12 P.2d 270 (1932); Dillard v. Jones, 58 Idaho 273, 72 P.2d 705 (1937); Rabideau v. Cramer, 59 Idaho 154, 81 P.2d 403 (1938); Bigley v. Smith, 64 Idaho 185, 129 P.2d 658 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment which was merely incidental or occasional, without regularity or for a limited and temporary purpose, was not a regularly recurring employment which was customary and to be anticipated with regularity, with its hazard a part of the overhead of the industry. Flynn v. Carson, 42 Idaho 141, 243 P. 818 (1926); Orr v. Boise Cold Storage Co., 52 Idaho 151, 12 P.2d 270 (1932); Rabideau v. Cramer, 59 Idaho 154, 81 P.2d 403 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee employed at $.75 an hour to calcimine the walls and ceiling of a place of business was engaged in “casual employment,” so that an injury sustained was not compensable in the event the employer had not elected to come within the workmen’s compensation act where the employment was without regularity and for a limited and temporary purpose of redecorating a place of business. Dawson v. Joe Chester Artificial Limb Co., 62 Idaho 508, 112 P.2d 494 (1941).
    Work being done by claimant in painting part of a public building when injured was “casual employment” within the exclusion of the workmen’s compensation act. Ross v. Reynolds, 64 Idaho 87, 127 P.2d 775 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant, injured in repairing the building, was engaged in “casual employment” within the meaning of the statute, though employer owned several buildings and claimant made all repairs thereon. Bigley v. Smith, 64 Idaho 185, 129 P.2d 658 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Intermittent employment of a truck owner by a fruit grower and seller to drive the truck in delivering fruit to markets was not casual within the exception of “casual employment” from the coverage of the workmen’s compensation act. Mulanix v. Falen, 64 Idaho 293, 130 P.2d 866 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Making drying trays which were an essential part of the equipment of a creamery engaged in the manufacturing of casein was as to the creamery only “casual employment,” excluded from coverage of workmen’s compensation act, in the absence of a showing of a regular or periodical custom of the creamery to employ workmen to make such trays or that the employment of workmen to make trays was essentially a part of the creamery’s business. Arbogast v. Jerome Co-op. Creamery, 65 Idaho 556, 149 P.2d 230 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Carpenter, who watched buildings of defendant for repair, and when they needed repair went and fixed them, could not recover compensation when he fell from a ladder while replacing a chimney jack, as such employment was casual. Schindler v. McFee, 69 Idaho 436, 207 P.2d 1158 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where dairy from time to time hired deceased to dig cesspools in series of three as additional cesspools were required, the digging of cesspools by deceased was not casual. Fitzen v. Cream Top Dairy, 73 Idaho 210, 249 P.2d 806 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Casual employment was employment which arose occasionally or incidentally at irregular intervals for a limited or temporary purpose and whose happening could not have been reasonably anticipated as certain or likely to occur and which was not a usual concomitant of the business, trade or profession of the employer. Vogl v. Smythe, 74 Idaho 115, 258 P.2d 355 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant hired by the hour to drag county road leading to employer’s residence and to clean up driftwood on the beach was engaged in casual employment and barred from compensation benefits. Vogl v. Smythe, 74 Idaho 115, 258 P.2d 355 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        If employment was casual, the employee was excluded from benefits of the act unless employer prior to accident had elected in writing to come under the act. Vogl v. Smythe, 74 Idaho 115, 258 P.2d 355 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        A painter employed to paint the eaves or fascia of a floral building, an operation last performed about four years before, was engaged in casual employment. Wachtler v. Calnon, 90 Idaho 468, 413 P.2d 449 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        A horse trainer for an employer engaged in the business of raising, breeding, training, boarding, and selling race horses, whose employment was a necessary and integral part of his employer’s business, was not a casual employee, even though he sometimes worked for others, worked at his own hours, and was paid on the basis of horses trained rather than hours worked. Manning v. Win Her Stables, Inc., 91 Idaho 549, 428 P.2d 55 (1967), overruled on other grounds, Tuma v. Kosterman, 106 Idaho 728, 682 P.2d 1275 (1984).
    Where employee, an office manager for employer in state of Idaho, was directed to go to Oregon for the purpose of establishing a new office and to perform such incidental duties as necessary, and where he was killed in Oregon while en route, his employment could not be designated as casual employment. Heck v. Dow, Inc., 93 Idaho 377, 461 P.2d 717 (1969).

        The construction of a flood control project by the United States was without financial gain to itself and was similar to an enterprise carried on by a church corporation without pecuniary gain, and under such analogy, since the church corporation would have been subject to a suit for damages for negligence so also was the government liable for its negligence in connection with the flood project under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

        Where an employee of the Idaho industrial training school received an injury arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, his right to compensation could not be defeated by the contention that he was engaged in an agricultural pursuit since the law provided that the workmen’s compensation act applied to employees of school districts, which was sufficient to authorize the award of compensation.

      An employer engaged in any of the exempt occupations listed in section 72-212[, Idaho Code,] may elect coverage thereof by a declaration in writing of himself and his surety filed with the commission that the provisions of the law shall apply thereto. Unless the effective date of such coverage is otherwise fixed in such declaration, coverage shall be deemed effective as of the date of filing such election, if the employer also files simultaneously or has on file approved security under section 72-301[, Idaho Code]; otherwise, such coverage shall be deemed effective upon the filing of approved security.

        The statute making an “employer,” who was subject to the provisions of the act, liable for compensation to an employee of a contractor or subcontractor under such employer, did not apply to an owner of premises on which a dwelling was being constructed, who had no right of control over the laborers directly employed by an uninsured contractor, and who was not an employer. Moon v. Ervin, 64 Idaho 464, 133 P.2d 933 (1943).

       <p>
        A lumber company furnishing most of the materials for the construction of a dwelling, advancing some money to an uninsured contractor, but not inducing any one to believe that the company was the employer of the workmen engaged by the contractor, or that the company had any interest in the construction of the dwelling, was not “estopped” to deny that it was the employer of the contractor’s workmen so as to impose liability for compensation on the company. Moon v. Ervin, 64 Idaho 464, 133 P.2d 933 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a lumber company supplying most of the material for the construction of a dwelling had no interest in the profits made by an uninsured contractor, though it was active in assisting the contractor in obtaining the contract and drew the plans and specifications and advanced some money for the payment of labor bills, such company was not a “joint adventurer” with the contractor, and the contractor was not an “independent contractor” of the company so as to impose liability on the company for injuries sustained by a workman of the contractor. Moon v. Ervin, 64 Idaho 464, 133 P.2d 933 (1943).

        Where one sold a saw mill on a conditional sales contract, secured the money owed by a chattel mortgage, and received part payment from the produce of the machinery sold, and who exercised no control over the business, and had no interest in the enterprise except as a creditor, he was not a proprietor or operator of the business conducted by the purchaser.

       <p>
        Where respondent company at the time of claimant’s injury was an employer subject to the provisions of the workmen’s compensation act and where its contractor was the employer of claimant, such respondent was claimant’s statutory employer, therefore claimant could elect against which one to pursue his remedy, but, having chosen the statutory employer, his remedy was subject to whatever defenses the law afforded his employer. Findley v. Flanigan, 84 Idaho 473, 373 P.2d 551 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Christensen v. Calico Constr. & Dev. Co., 97 Idaho 327, 543 P.2d 1167 (1975).

        An employer was liable for compensation to an employee of a subcontractor working for this employer at the time of the accident. In re Fisk, 40 Idaho 304, 232 P. 569 (1925).
    The failure of the owner of premises on which a dwelling was being constructed, who was not an “employer” within the meaning of the workmen’s compensation act defining that term, or a contractor or subcontractor within said act prescribing the means of securing compensation to employees, to enforce against the contractor and the contractor’s surety provision of the contract requiring the contractor to maintain insurance to protect the owner from claims under the act, did not render the owner secondarily liable to a laborer injured in the course of the construction of the building.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the liability extended to both the original contractor and subcontractor, so far as the employer was concerned, and gave to the employer the right to recover any amount paid by him from the contractor or subcontractors, did not prevent or interfere with the employee making his claim and asserting his rights directly against either or all, and if for any reason the employer desired to have the subcontractor brought in and bound by any order or judgment that may have been entered against the employer, it was his duty to have such subcontractor made a party to the proceedings. Hiebert v. Howell, 59 Idaho 591, 85 P.2d 699 (1938); Gifford v. Nottingham, 68 Idaho 330, 193 P.2d 831 (1948).

        Legislature intended to require principal, his independent contractor and any subcontractor under the independent contractor to pay workmen’s compensation to any workman injured on the job whether employed by the principal, independent contractor or subcontractor. In re Sines, 82 Idaho 527, 356 P.2d 226 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the statute did not provide for the situation wherein the negligence of the statutory employer was the sole, proximate cause of the injuries suffered by the employee, there was nothing to deprive the actual employer from obtaining indemnity or reimbursement from the negligent statutory employer to the extent of the compensation for which the actual employer was liable under this act.

       The right to compensation under this law shall not be affected by the fact that the injury, occupational disease or death is caused under circumstances creating in some person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages therefor, such person so liable being referred to as the third party. Such third party shall not include those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code; nor include the owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workmen there employed.
      </li>

       Action may be instituted against such third party by the employee, or in event compensation has been claimed and awarded, by the employee and employer jointly, in the employee’s name, or, if the employee refuses to participate in such action, by the employer in the employee’s name.

      <li id="t72c02s72-223ol13">
       If compensation has been claimed and awarded, the employer having paid such compensation or having become liable therefor, shall be subrogated to the rights of the employee, to recover against such third party to the extent of the employer’s compensation liability.

      <li id="t72c02s72-223ol14">
       Unless otherwise agreed, upon any recovery by the employee against the third party, the employer shall pay or have deducted from its subrogated portion thereof, a proportionate share of the costs and attorney’s fees incurred by the employee in obtaining such recovery unless one (1) or more of the following circumstances exist:

Such credit shall apply as future compensation benefits become payable, and the employer shall reimburse the employee for the proportionate share of attorney’s fees and costs paid by the employee in obtaining that portion of the third party recovery corresponding to the credit claimed. The employer shall not be required to pay such attorney’s fees and costs related to the future credit prior to the time the credit is claimed.

        Apportionment of Damages.
       </h5>
       <p>
        If an employee brings a suit against a third party in addition to receiving workmen’s compensation benefits, the court will apportion the employee’s damages between the employer and third party. The focus of the court in apportionment is two-fold: (1) to achieve an equitable distribution of liability for the employee’s injuries as between the employer and the third party, based on the facts of each case, and (2) to prevent the overcompensation of an employee, i.e., to prevent the employee from retaining both the workmen’s compensation benefits and the full tort recovery.

        This section does not limit payment of attorneys’ fees and costs to situations where there is or has been an administrative or judicial proceeding; this section applies to all circumstances where any recovery has been effectuated by the employee against a third party. A civil action is not a condition precedent to the application of subsection (4) of this section. Walker v. Hensley Trucking, 107 Idaho 572, 691 P.2d 1187 (1984).

    The proportion of a surety’s benefit in a third party recovery, and thus the surety’s proportionate share of the costs and fees, should be measured not only by the surety’s past compensation liability which was reimbursed by the third party recovery, but also by the surety’s future compensation liability which is absolved by the third party recovery.

        Given the statutory definition of employer under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>, the fact that this term and its applicable definition were imported almost word-for-word into this section, and there was no indication within the Idaho worker’s compensation act that the legislature intended to overturn years of case law, the statutory employer analysis should be used when determining the plain meaning of this section; the court finds the meaning of that section clear and unambiguous.

       </p>
       <p>
        Court rejected an employee’s claim that this section of the Idaho worker’s compensation act violated the Equal Protection Clause because the employee made no attempt to clearly identify to the court the classification challenged, and instead the employee appeared to challenge the rationality of the entire statutory scheme, which was not appropriately considered an equal protection challenge. Robison v. Bateman-Hall, Inc., 139 Idaho 207, 76 P.3d 951 (2003).
    Under this section, applying a more limited test to owners as opposed to subcontractors is supported by the express language and general purpose of the Idaho worker’s compensation act; it makes sense to have a rule that limits a property owner’s liability under the statutory concept of “employer” under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102 </a></cite>while interpreting the contractor or subcontractor’s liability more broadly.

        Although family members of an employee were entitled to (and did receive) worker’s compensation benefits for the employee’s death, the district court erred by finding that the members’ wrongful death action was barred by the exclusivity rule under the worker’s compensation law.

        Employer food service supplier was immune to liability for injuries received by an employee of its subcontractor, because the subcontractor had properly provided workers’ compensation coverage for its employees. Gonzalez v. Lamb Weston, Inc., 142 Idaho 120, 124 P.3d 996 (2005).

        Where the Idaho department of transportation (ITD) awarded a contract for road work, an employee of a subcontractor, injured while taking a break, was a statutory employee of the ITD for purposes of the Idaho worker’s compensation act: thus, the employee’s negligence suit against the ITD was barred by this section.

        Where a full hearing of the “loaned employee” issue would occur in pending tort action between injured employee plaintiff and defendant employer of employees who injured plaintiff, the interests of defendant were fully protected from any further suits by the plaintiff’s employer or its surety through the subrogation provisions of this section and it was proper for the district court under Idaho R. Civ. P. 57 to dismiss a declaratory judgment action in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits. Scott v. Agricultural Prods. Corp., 102 Idaho 147, 627 P.2d 326 (1981).

       <p>
        Where the employer is not negligent, the employer is entitled to subrogate to the employee’s recovery against a third party, and thus obtain a reimbursement of the workmen’s compensation benefits he paid; conversely, in those situations where the employer is negligent, the employer is denied this reimbursement and the third party is entitled to a credit against his judgment in the amount of the workmen’s compensation benefits the employer paid. Thus, the employee’s award is reduced by the amount of workmen’s compensation he received; in either event, the employee does not retain both the workmen’s compensation benefits and the full tort recovery. Schneider v. Farmers Merchant, Inc., 106 Idaho 241, 678 P.2d 33 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where third party paid consideration for release of any claim employer may have had based on the accident, employer’s subrogation rights were extinguished and third party became subrogated to employer’s right of reimbursement. Thus, in the event employer’s negligence was litigated, and employer was found not negligent, third party held employer’s right to be reimbursed for the workmen’s compensation benefits paid; conversely, in the event employer was found negligent, third party retained its right to receive a credit towards his judgment, in the amount of the workmen’s compensation benefits paid. Therefore, in the posture of such case, the determination of the employer’s negligence was unnecessary. Schneider v. Farmers Merchant, Inc., 106 Idaho 241, 678 P.2d 33 (1983).
    The insurer of an employer who is jointly negligent with a third party is not allowed the statutory subrogation rights or reimbursement for workmen’s compensation benefits paid to the injured employee allowed by subsection (3) of this section; the third party may defend on the basis that the employer was negligent whether or not the employer is a party to the action. Runcorn v. Shearer Lumber Prods., Inc., 107 Idaho 389, 690 P.2d 324 (1984).

        Where the record was devoid of any findings or testimony as to the medical expense incurred due to medical malpractice, the industrial commission’s order of an offset of the claimant’s total award to the workers’ compensation surety pursuant to this section for payments made for the claimant’s medical expenses due to the medical malpractice was reversed and remanded for further proceedings to determine the surety’s subrogation rights, with recovery from the malpractice settlement in excess of the surety’s expenditures in connection therewith to remain in the claimant. Presnell v. Kelly, 113 Idaho 1, 740 P.2d 43 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Insurance company had a subrogated interest in party’s settlement for injuries sustained in a work-related accident because the unilateral actions of employee and third-party could not restrict the subrogation rights of employer who voluntarily paid worker’s compensation benefits. Struhs v. Protection Technologies, Inc., 133 Idaho 715, 992 P.2d 164 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where insurance contract reduces amount to be paid to injured insured by payments awarded to the insured under the workers’ compensation law, that reduction should only be by the net amount of worker’s compensation benefits paid or payable to the insured: monies repaid to the state insurance fund through subrogation under this section should not be deducted from an award under the insurance contract. Cherry v. Coregis Ins. Co., 146 Idaho 882, 204 P.3d 522 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Entire proceeds of an injured worker’s third party settlement were subject to subrogation, because there is no language in this section indicating that a third-party recovery is to be segregated out into its individual elements or that certain portions, such as pain and suffering, are to be protected from an employer’s right of subrogation. Izaguirre v. R&L Carriers Shared Servs., LLC, 155 Idaho 229, 308 P.3d 929 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to the apportionment rule, in a workers’ compensation case, the industrial commission erred by ruling that the employer’s negligence with regards to the employee’s accident, if proved, was not a bar to the employer being reimbursed for worker’s compensation payments it paid to the employee, and erred in abrogating the employer negligence rule that the negligent employer was barred from seeking subrogation of an employee’s recovery against a third-party.

        Where a third party injured an employee, he could not urge that he was not liable because the employee was a minor member of the employer’s family, dwelling in his house, and that the employer had not, prior to the accident, filed with the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] an election in writing that the provisions of the workmen’s compensation law should apply to the injured employee, where it was shown that compensation had been paid under an agreement between employer and his insurance carrier and the employee and approved by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission].

        The provision of the workmen’s compensation act reciting its purpose, and the provision permitting an injured employee at his option to claim compensation or to proceed against a third person, and subrogating any employer who had paid compensation to the rights of the employee, were in pari materia, and must have been considered and construed together.

        The workmen’s compensation act was remedial and special law providing compensation for injured employees without referring to negligence on the part of either employer or employee. Lebak v. Nelson, 62 Idaho 96, 107 P.2d 1054 (1940).

       <p>
        A workman employed by a subcontractor digging sewer trenches for a general contractor building sewers for a city was an employee of the general contractor and not of the city, and the general contractor was answerable rather than the city for the death of the workman in the course of his employment through the negligence of the subcontractor, and the heirs could not maintain an action other than that provided by the workmen’s compensation law against the general contractor.

        Where recovery by dependents against a third person for death of an employee was for a greater sum than had been paid out as workmen’s compensation by the employer and insurance carrier, the court should have directed payment to employer and insurance carrier of amount paid out by them to the dependents, and when the parties could not agree upon the amount thus paid out, an application should have been made supported by a certified copy of the policy of insurance, the summary of the award by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], and the compensation agreement.

        Where injury was caused by third person, dependents of deceased employee might claim compensation under the statute or proceed at law to recover damages against such third person. Workmen’s Comp. Exch. v. Chicago, M., St. P. & Pac. R.R., 45 F.2d 885 (D. Idaho 1930).

        Neither employer nor his workmen’s compensation insurance carrier was “some other person than the employer” within the meaning of the Idaho workmen’s compensation act which allowed the option of bringing of an action for damages against person other than the employer. Schulz v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., 125 F. Supp. 411 (E.D. Wash. 1954).

        Actions of an employee, his heirs or personal representatives against a third person to recover damages for personal injuries or death sustained by reason of actionable negligence of such party were not abolished by this statute, the provisions of the statute being expressly confined to those occupying the relationship of employee and employer. Gifford v. Nottingham, 68 Idaho 330, 193 P.2d 831 (1948); Clearwater Timber Protective Ass’n v. District Court, 84 Idaho 129, 369 P.2d 571 (1962).

        Employer’s failure to intervene in employee’s action against third party tort-feasor, prospective subrogee, indicated action to be with consent of employer so that decision was without prejudice to employer. Hence jurisdiction of industrial accident board [now industrial commission] over original claim was not divested nor was employee’s claim barred by the action against third party. Lake v. State, 71 Idaho 107, 227 P.2d 361 (1951).
    An employer or his surety cannot recover against a third party tortfeasor for compensation paid to an employee for injuries resulting from concurring negligence of the employer and such third party. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Adams, 91 Idaho 151, 417 P.2d 417 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not the intent of the legislature in former law providing for third party liability to allow an injured workman a double recovery and where a third party was liable to pay for the damages sustained by claimant who effected a settlement before a compensation award was made, the employer and surety were entitled to be subrogated to the third party settlement obtained by claimant and should have been allowed a credit against their obligation to claimant in the amount of the settlement. Shields v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., 95 Idaho 572, 513 P.2d 404 (1973).

        In action against elevator company by employer and employer’s workmen’s compensation insurer seeking damages by subrogation for workmen’s compensation benefits paid to employee who received injuries when he fell down an elevator shaft after elevator car’s floor gave way, employer and its surety were barred from recovering damages by employer’s contributory negligence in failing to inspect and maintain the elevator. McDrummond v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 97 Idaho 679, 551 P.2d 966 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under former section regarding liability of third parties, the employer and its carrier were entitled to subrogation against the proceeds of a wrongful death recovery from a third-party tortfeasor except to the extent that such recovery exceeded their expenses in pursuing the action and the workmen’s compensation benefits they had paid or were liable to pay. Hall v. Young’s Dairy Prods. Co., 98 Idaho 562, 569 P.2d 907 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employer’s carrier paid workmen’s compensation benefits of over $21,000 to the surviving spouse and children of an employee killed in the course of his employment, the employer and carrier were subrogated to the survivor’s rights in a wrongful death action against a third-party tortfeasor and were entitled to the $10,000 recovery less an award of $2,000 to cover the survivors’ attorney’s fees. Hall v. Young’s Dairy Prods. Co., 98 Idaho 562, 569 P.2d 907 (1977).

        In an action against a third party for injury to, or death of, an employee, where an award had been made under the workmen’s compensation act, and the employer and insurance carrier appeared as plaintiffs, the court may have instructed that the employer and insurance carrier appear as and were proper parties plaintiff because of the fact that they had been subrogated to the rights of the employee or his beneficiaries, because of their liability to pay benefits under the act, and that the jury would have nothing to do with the question of what amount such plaintiffs may have been liable for under the act, and the liability under the act was not dependent on negligence as in the action against third party.

    At hearing before the commission on claimant’s application for full income benefits as the surviving widow of employee who was killed when his semi-truck overturned, the expert testimony of a toxicologist regarding the effect of employee’s .117 percent blood alcohol level on his ability to operate a motor vehicle was not necessarily binding on the commission which could have concluded that all of the evidence of employee’s intoxication did not overcome statutory presumption that employee’s death was not caused by his intoxication. Hatley v. Lewiston Grain Growers, Inc., 97 Idaho 719, 552 P.2d 482 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In hearings on claimant’s application for full income benefits as surviving widow of employee who was killed when his semi-truck overturned, the commission did not err in its conclusion that there was a lack of substantial evidence in the record that employee’s death was caused by intoxication, even though test results revealed that decedent had .117 percent blood alcohol level, where truck stop proprietors testified that employee’s behavior was normal and that he did not appear to be intoxicated. Hatley v. Lewiston Grain Growers, Inc., 97 Idaho 719, 552 P.2d 482 (1976).

        In view of the presumption contained in this section that an employee’s death was not occasioned by his intoxication, a finding by the commission that employee was intoxicated did not lead to an inevitable conclusion that the intoxication caused the fatal accident.

        Once an employer has come forward with substantial affirmative evidence to indicate that an accident did not arise out of the employment, the burden shifts back to an employee to persuade the industrial commission that it did indeed arise out of the employment.

       </p>
       <p>
        While negative evidence alone will not defeat the statutory presumption contained in this section, this evidence may still be considered along with substantial affirmative evidence in evaluating whether substantial evidence has been presented to rebut the statutory presumption. Evans v. Hara’s, Inc., 123 Idaho 473, 849 P.2d 934 (1993).
       </p>

        A letter from a cardiovascular surgeon, that employee’s stroke had no cause or relationship with his employment, did not constitute substantial evidence contrary to the presumption that the employee’s injury arose out of his employment; the industrial commission noted that the foundation of the surgeon’s opinion was unknown. Politte v. DOT, 126 Idaho 270, 882 P.2d 437 (1994).

        Surgeon’s letter offered as medical evidence was not sufficiently substantial to overcome the presumption contained in this section that employee’s injury arose out of his employment. Politte v. DOT, 126 Idaho 270, 882 P.2d 437 (1994).
    The testimony of an employee’s supervisors that employee’s stroke had no causal connection to his work was not sufficient to prevent the application of the presumption contained in this section because the evidence that may be considered for this purpose must be medical evidence; the causal relationship of an injury to the claimant’s employment must be supported by at least some medical proof. Politte v. DOT, 126 Idaho 270, 882 P.2d 437 (1994).

       Every employer shall secure the payment of compensation under this law in one (1) of the following ways:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t72c03s72-301ol11a">
         By insuring and keeping insured with a policy of worker’s compensation insurance as defined in section 41-506(d), Idaho Code, the payment of compensation with any insurer, as defined in section 41-103, Idaho Code, authorized by the director of the department of insurance to transact such insurance, provided, that every public employer shall insure its liability for payment of compensation with the state insurance fund unless such fund shall refuse to accept the risk when the application for insurance is made; or
        </li>
        <li id="t72c03s72-301ol11b">
         An employer may become self-insured by obtaining the approval of the industrial commission, and by depositing and maintaining in a custodial account with the state treasurer money or acceptable security instruments satisfactory to the commission securing the payment by said employer of compensation according to the terms of this law. Such acceptable security instruments are bonds, treasury bills, interest-bearing notes or other obligations of the United States for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the payment of principal and interest. In lieu of such money or security instruments, the commission may allow or require such employer to file or maintain with the state treasurer a surety bond with any company authorized to transact surety insurance in Idaho. The commission shall adopt rules governing the qualifications of self-insured employers, the nature and amount of security to be deposited and maintained with the state treasurer, and the conditions under which an employer may continue to be self-insured.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t72c03s72-301ol12">
       No insurer shall be permitted to transact worker’s compensation insurance covering the liability of employers under this law unless it shall have been authorized to do business under the laws of this state and until it shall have received the approval of the commission. To the end that the workers secured under this law shall be adequately protected, the commission shall require such insurer to deposit and maintain in a custodial account with the state treasurer money or acceptable security instruments in an amount equal to the total amounts of all outstanding and unpaid compensation awards against such insurer. Acceptable security instruments are bonds, treasury bills, interest-bearing notes or other obligations of the United States for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the payment of principal and interest. Acceptable security instruments also include municipal bonds issued by the state of Idaho, its subdivisions, counties, cities, towns, villages and school districts. The insurer shall have the responsibility to monitor the ratings for its bonds. Bonds held by worker’s compensation insurers in support of insurance obligations must have been assigned a credit rating grade not less than “single A minus” by one (1) or more credit rating providers registered with the United States securities and exchange commission as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). If the credit rating assigned to the bond by the NRSRO is downgraded below “single A minus,” the worker’s compensation insurer shall within thirty (30) days of the downgrade replace the bond with one (1) that meets the credit quality requirement specified in this section. In lieu of such money or security instruments, the commission may allow or require such insurer to file or maintain with the state treasurer a surety bond of some company or companies authorized to do business in this state for and in the amounts equaling the total unpaid compensation awards against such insurer.
    (3) When an insurer has been placed in liquidation, any security being held in a custodial account with the state treasurer under this section shall be converted into cash and transferred into the insolvent insurer fund created in subsection (4) of this section. Such funds shall continue to be held for the purpose of securing any future claims made against the insolvent insurer under this law or until released by the commission to the liquidator, if one exists, or to the insurer’s state of domicile, as provided herein. Interest earned on moneys deposited in the insolvent insurer fund shall be credited, pro rata, to the account balance of security being held to answer claims made under this law against an insolvent insurer. Moneys deposited in the insolvent insurer fund may be used to pay the reasonable costs or expenses charged by any financial institution holding such funds on deposit for the state treasurer. Any balance in funds remaining on deposit in the insolvent insurer fund to answer the claims of an insolvent insurer after discharge of that insurer’s liquidator may be transferred to the liquidator, if one still exists, or to the liquidated insurer’s state of domicile, at such time as the commission determines that said security is no longer required to be held by the state treasurer for the purposes of this law.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (4) There is hereby created in the state treasury the insolvent insurer fund. Moneys in the fund are hereby continuously appropriated for the purposes set forth in the provisions of this section. Interest earned on moneys in the fund shall be returned to the fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) The approval by the commission of any insurer or self-insured employer may be withdrawn if it shall appear to the commission that workers secured thereby under this law are not fully protected.

        Commission’s ruling denying city’s application for self-insurance was not premature and was supported by substantial evidence where resolution passed by the city seemed to contemplate limiting the city’s liability to $500,000 per occurrence and commission had never authorized self-insurance with limited liability and such limitation is not permitted by rule, regulation or statute, where city had no plan to provide excess insurance and this meant the statutory requirement that payment of compensation be sure and certain was not met, where city had little experience with workers’ compensation to give it the required expertise in workers’ compensation, and where city was given every opportunity to support its position through its application and various other materials provided to the Commission.

      The provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code, with respect to security, shall be met alternatively, by the employer demonstrating to the commission that security for its self-insured worker’s compensation program is covered by a cost reimbursement contract with the federal government for work performed in connection with the Idaho national laboratory including research, development, demonstration, testing, national security, defense, environmental cleanup or waste management if the cost reimbursement contract provides for the payment as otherwise required in this chapter. An employer that becomes self-insured under this section is not required to provide and maintain a security deposit, is not required to have a payroll history and is not required to have excess insurance coverage. In addition, because of the federal government reimbursement, the employer’s self-insurance program includes coverage for claims for events taking place before the effective date of the self-insured program, and no separate coverage or deposit for such claims is required.

        Pursuant to 40 U.S.C.S. § 290, which extended the authority of states to apply workers’ compensation laws to lands owned or held by the United States, Idaho’s workers’ compensation laws apply on land “owned or held by the United States of America by deed or act of cession, by purchase or otherwise,”, and the right which Indians held in reservation land is that of occupancy, the fee and right of disposition remains in the United States government. As such, Idaho’s workers’ compensation laws apply on the reservation and the state courts have the subject matter jurisdiction to enforce such laws against an Indian tribe member operating a business on an Indian reservation.

     <p>
      The director of the department of insurance, after consultation with sureties authorized to issue worker’s compensation policies and guaranty contracts in this state, may put into effect a reasonable system for the equitable apportionment among such sureties of applicants for such policies or guaranty contracts who are in good faith entitled to but are unable to procure the same through ordinary methods. Such system shall be so drawn as to guarantee that such an applicant, if not in default on worker’s compensation premiums, shall, following his application to the assigned risk system and tender of required premium, be covered by worker’s compensation insurance or his coverage guaranteed. When any such system has been approved, all such carriers shall subscribe thereto and participate therein. Assignment shall be in such manner that, as far as practicable, no surety shall be assigned a larger proportion of compensation premiums under assigned policies during any calendar year than that which the total of compensation premiums written in the state by such surety during the preceding year bears to the total compensation premiums written in the state by all such sureties during the preceding calendar year. Provided however, that domestic reciprocal insurers which insure only worker’s compensation risks shall be exempt from participation in this system. Premium charges for the assigned risk plan shall not be excessive, inadequate, nor unfairly discriminatory and shall produce sufficient revenue to make the plan self-sustaining and self-supporting.

        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 220, § 2, in the first sentence substituted “director of the department of insurance” for “commissioner of insurance”; in the first and second sentences substituted “worker’s compensation” for “workmen’s compensation” in each occurrence; and added the present fifth sentence.

     <p>
      There is hereby created in the department of administration the office of manager of the industrial special indemnity fund, elsewhere in this chapter referred to as manager, whose duties shall be to administer the fund without liability on the part of the state or the manager beyond the amount of such fund. Among the powers of the manager shall be the power to evaluate, investigate, adjust claims made against the fund and make agreements, subject to the approval of the industrial commission, for compensation for injuries and occupational diseases in accordance with the provisions of this act, including the power to order payment from the fund for such medical, hospital and nursing care charges as injured persons or those suffering from occupational diseases may be entitled to from the fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation of such manager shall be as provided in section 59-508, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      The manager shall be given notice of all applications, hearings and proceedings involving rights of the fund, and shall represent the fund in all proceedings brought to enforce a claim against it. The manager shall have the authority to employ such medical or other experts and to defray the expense thereof and of such witnesses as are reasonably necessary to administer, evaluate or defend the fund. The manager may also employ such employees as are necessary to assist in the administration of the fund. The manager may also employ legal counsel, or obtain legal counsel pursuant to section 72-330, Idaho Code, to represent and conduct on behalf of the fund all suits, actions and proceedings whatsoever involving the fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The manager may, in his official name, sue and be sued in all the courts of the state and before the industrial commission in all actions or proceedings arising out of anything done or offered in connection with the industrial special indemnity fund or business related thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      The industrial commission shall compute and collect the assessment provided by section 72-327, Idaho Code, and shall make quarterly reports to the fund of the same. The manager of the fund shall, each quarter of each year, prepare and file with the industrial commission and the state treasurer a report of all expenses of administration, legal expenses and payments from the fund, which reports will be kept on file and open to inspection by any interested person.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director of the department of administration shall appoint the manager from a list of at least three (3) names provided by the industrial commission. The manager shall serve at the pleasure of the director of the department of administration.

       If an employee who has a permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin, incurs a subsequent disability by an injury or occupational disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, and by reason of the combined effects of both the pre-existing impairment and the subsequent injury or occupational disease or by reason of the aggravation and acceleration of the pre-existing impairment suffers total and permanent disability, the employer and surety shall be liable for payment of compensation benefits only for the disability caused by the injury or occupational disease, including scheduled and unscheduled permanent disabilities, and the injured employee shall be compensated for the remainder of his income benefits out of the industrial special indemnity account [fund].

       “Permanent physical impairment” is as defined in section 72-422, Idaho Code, provided, however, as used in this section such impairment must be a permanent condition, whether congenital or due to injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining re-employment if the claimant should become employed. This shall be interpreted subjectively as to the particular employee involved, however, the mere fact that a claimant is employed at the time of the subsequent injury shall not create a presumption that the pre-existing permanent physical impairment was not of such seriousness as to constitute such hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment.

        When an industrial accident aggravated a preexisting infirmity, the employer was liable for that portion of the disability and medical expense causally connected to the accident itself. Clark v. Sage, 95 Idaho 79, 502 P.2d 323 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant could not litigate the issue of apportionment based upon the identical 33% whole person impairment rating he relied upon in entering into agreement with the state insurance fund and the state hospital for the agreement provided the plaintiff a lump sum award based upon his 33% whole person impairment rating and since he then sought to attribute 13% of his 33% whole person impairment to a pre-existing condition, thereby increasing his whole person impairment rating to 46%, without presenting additional allegations of pre-existing impairment his claim against the industrial special indemnity fund was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

        Under subsection (1) of this section, a pre-existing impairment can result from a previous industrial accident in which the employer and the industrial special indemnity fund shared liability. Quincy v. Quincy, 136 Idaho 1, 27 P.3d 410 (2001). Apportionment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Essentially, this statute provides for an apportionment of nonmedical factors between the employer/surety and the industrial special indemnity fund; the appropriate solution to the problem of apportioning the nonmedical disability factors, in an odd-lot case where the fund is involved, is to prorate the nonmedical portion of disability between the employer and the fund, in proportion to their respective percentages of responsibility for the physical impairment. Neilson v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 106 Idaho 878, 684 P.2d 280 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no question that the prior injury did not combine with the recent injury to create total and permanent disability, because there was already total disability before the second injury ever occurred, it was inappropriate for the industrial commission to apportion total and permanent disability pursuant to the
    Carey
    formula (
        Carey v. Clearwater County Road Dep’t
        , 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984)) between the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) and the employer. Hamilton v. Ted Beamis Logging & Constr., 127 Idaho 221, 899 P.2d 434 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission erred in its determination that medical benefits awarded to workers’ compensation claimant who was totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot doctrine could be assessed totally against employer’s surety and were not apportionable under the 1990 version of this section; though that would be the case following the 1991 amendments to this section, this award of medical benefits had to be apportioned in the same proportion as the determined responsibility of the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) and employer’s surety for the nonmedical portions of the award. Dohl v. PSF Indus., Inc., 127 Idaho 232, 899 P.2d 445 (1995).

        Where a claimant had suffered prior injuries which resulted in permanent partial disability and later was injured during the course of his employment as a county undersheriff, with the last injury resulting in 100 percent total and permanent disability, the industrial commission erred in holding as a matter of law that the employer’s and the surety’s liability could be calculated by subtracting claimant’s permanent disability before the accident from the total compensation due, since this section required no finding of permanent disability prior to the last work-related injury. Curtis v. Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office, 102 Idaho 300, 629 P.2d 696 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require a finding of permanent disability existing prior to a work-related injury, but requires a finding of a pre-existing permanent physical impairment and limits the employer’s liability to the amount of disability attributable to the particular injury occurring in his employment; the indemnity fund is liable for the difference between the compensation that would be payable for the second injury alone and the total compensation due and the industrial commission must determine the ratio of apportionment. Curtis v. Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office, 102 Idaho 300, 629 P.2d 696 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant’s consolidated claims encompassed two independent work-related injuries caused by two separate accidents at different places of employment, and two non-work-related conditions for which compensation was sought, the industrial commission erred in apportioning liability based upon the impact of an injury which was not “preexisting” within the meaning of this section. Smith v. J.B. Parson Co., 127 Idaho 937, 908 P.2d 1244 (1996).
    Industrial commission’s determination that employer at the time of injury was liable for a portion of the percentage of disability attributable to the injury, where a preexisting degenerative condition was accelerated by the injury, was affirmed, where supported by substantial and competent evidence, although, at the time of the injury, claimant had not reached total permanent disability. Quincy v. Quincy, 136 Idaho 1, 27 P.3d 410 (2001).

        Apportioning disability under both<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§ 72-406</a></cite>(1) and subsection (1) of this section requires two steps. First, the industrial commission must determine the claimant’s disability when considering the pre-existing physical impairment(s) and the subsequent injury, and, second, it must then apportion disability between the injury and the pre-existing impairment(s).

        Testimony to a “medical probability,” can be received in such manner as to which the parties may agree, or as the commission may direct, and the apportionment by the commission required by this section can be determined, also to a medical probability.

        Burden of Proof.
       </h5>
       <p>
        If the evidence of the medical and nonmedical factors places a claimant prima facie in the “odd-lot” category, that is a group of workers who are physically able to perform some work but are so handicapped that they will not be employed regularly in any well-known branch of the labor market, the burden is then on the employer or the special industrial indemnity fund to show that some kind of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant. Lyons v. Industrial Special Indem. Fund, 98 Idaho 403, 565 P.2d 1360 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to meet the burden of showing that some kind of suitable work was regularly and continuously available to a claimant, the fund could not merely show that the claimant was able to perform some type of work, but must establish that there was an actual job within a reasonable distance from the claimant’s home which he was able to perform or for which he could be trained and which he would have a reasonable opportunity to obtain. Lyons v. Industrial Special Indem. Fund, 98 Idaho 403, 565 P.2d 1360 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a claimant whose injury in the course of his employment aggravated a preexisting injury fell into the odd-lot category, the burden was shifted to the employer to show that some kind of suitable work was regularly and continuously available to the claimant. Francis v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 98 Idaho 407, 565 P.2d 1364 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ultimate rating of permanent disability should be an administrative finding by the commission with no particular method of proof required, and a claimant is not required to present testimony of vocational experts expressing their opinions in numerical or percentage terms. Bell v. Clear Springs Trout Co., 107 Idaho 568, 691 P.2d 1183 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The claimant has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of total disability within the odd-lot category; once the claimant meets his or her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of total disability within the odd-lot category, the burden then shifts to the industrial special indemnity fund to show that some kind of suitable work is readily and continuously available to the claimant. Mapusaga v. Red Lion Riverside Inn, 113 Idaho 842, 748 P.2d 1372 (1987), overruled on other grounds, Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).
    Burden of proof is on the party seeking to invoke the liability of the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) under the statute, to show that the disability would not have been total “but for” the pre-existing condition. Garcia v. J.R. Simplot Co., 115 Idaho 966, 772 P.2d 173 (1989), overruled on other grounds, Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a vocational evaluator testified that taking into account the loss of worker’s arm, the impairment to her hip, and the pre-existing conditions of her back and thumb, there were no jobs, among the 2500 he considered, the worker could perform, and where he indicated the specific ways in which the condition of her back eliminated her from some jobs and stated that the condition of her thumb prevented her from being able to handle equipment that required fine motor coordination, the evidence was sufficient to fulfill the requirement that but for the pre-existing impairments, worker would not have been totally and permanently disabled. Garcia v. J.R. Simplot Co., 115 Idaho 966, 772 P.2d 173 (1989), overruled on other grounds, Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the doctrine of quasi-estoppel, an employer could not assert that a claimant had a preexisting impairment prior to his injury for which the industrial special indemnity fund was liable, because the employer had previously argued that the same preexisting impairment was not work-related. Vawter v. UPS, 155 Idaho 903, 318 P.3d 893 (2014).

        Combined Effects.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the “combined effects” requirement in subsection (1) of this section requires a claimant seeking to establish ISIF liability to also prove that the disability would not have been total but for the industrial injury, where the pre-existing impairment alone resulted in claimant’s total disability, she could not recover from ISIF. Bybee v. State, Indus. Special Indemnity Fund, 129 Idaho 76, 921 P.2d 1200 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test to satisfy the “combined effects” requirement of subsection (1) of this section is whether, but for the industrial injury, the worker would have been totally and permanently disabled immediately following the occurrence of that injury. This encompasses both the combination scenario where each element contributes to the total disability, and the case where the subsequent injury accelerates and aggravates the pre-existing impairment. Bybee v. State, Indus. Special Indemnity Fund, 129 Idaho 76, 921 P.2d 1200 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        To satisfy the “combined effects” requirement in this section, a claimant must show that but for the pre-existing impairments, he would not have been totally and permanently disabled. Eckhart v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 133 Idaho 260, 985 P.2d 685 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue whether a total permanent disability is the result of the combined effects of a pre-existing and work-related injury is more expansive than a simple medical inquiry, because a determination of total permanent disability necessarily takes into account non-medical factors, e.g., testimony from vocational rehabilitation experts. Green v. Green, 160 Idaho 275, 371 P.3d 329 (2016).

Section 72-431, governing the inheritability of income benefits, applies only if an employee has sustained a disability less than total.

        Once the industrial commission places new evidence into the record, all parties should have a right to dispute that evidence by challenging its validity or by introducing additional or conflicting evidence; thus, it was error for the commission not to allow the industrial special indemnity fund to dispute the physician’s rating of 12% impairment with respect to the claimant’s arm.

        This section is phrased in the disjunctive, and not in the conjunctive, and if either condition exists, i.e., total permanent disability occasioned by the combined effects of both the preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury, or if the facts disclose aggravation and acceleration of the preexisting impairment by the industrial accident, then the liability of industrial special indemnity fund arises. Sines v. Appel, 103 Idaho 9, 644 P.2d 331 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee with a pre-existing permanent physical impairment, regardless of whether this injury came about as a result of a work-related accident or nonwork related accident, is entitled to recover from the industrial special indemnity fund; thus, the industrial special indemnity fund is not entitled to the defense contained in subsection (1) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c02s72-208" target="_self">§ 72-208</a></cite>. Mapusaga v. Red Lion Riverside Inn, 113 Idaho 842, 748 P.2d 1372 (1987), overruled on other grounds, Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commission’s determination that claimant failed to establish prima facie that he was totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot doctrine so as to render the industrial special indemnity fund liable for workers’ compensation benefits was supported by substantial and competent evidence where claimant himself stated that he did not believe that the vocational counselors were attempting to find him specific employment, and where the records supported the conclusion that claimant did not attempt any other types of employment, that efforts to find such employment would not be futile, that the vocational counselors’ testimony was vague and their efforts to find employment for the claimant were unmotivated and minimal at best and that little weight should be given to their conclusions, and although claimant did have a significant disability, with his experience, education, training and physical abilities, he was employable. Lethrud v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 126 Idaho 560, 887 P.2d 1067 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Special indemnity fund was not liable to the claimant pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, as the claimant did not show her pre-existing condition was aggravated and accelerated by a subsequent injury or occupational disease; rather, the most the claimant showed was a pre-existing impairment that grew worse over time, which was not covered under the statute. Lopez v. State, 136 Idaho 174, 30 P.3d 952 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The elements that a claimant must prove to establish the ISIF’s liability under this section are: (1) the claimant suffered from a pre-existing impairment; (2) the pre-existing impairment was manifest; (3) the pre-existing impairment was a subjective hindrance to employment; and (4) the combined effects of the pre-existing impairment and the subsequent injury or occupational disease resulted in total and permanent disability, or the subsequent injury or occupational disease aggravated and accelerated the pre-existing impairment to cause total and permanent disability. Aguilar v. State, 164 Idaho 893, 436 P.3d 1242 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Idaho industrial commission (commission) properly determined an employee’s disability at the time of a hearing, because the commission (1) considered the evidence presented at the time of the hearing, and (2) understood the employee’s psychological impairment was not a basis for statutory liability.

        Where a claimant was a 48-year-old male with a ninth-grade education whose vocational training was confined solely to heavy manual labor which he could no longer perform as a result of back injuries, and where he lived in a small mountain community where opportunities for light work were limited, the claimant fell within the “odd-lot” category of claimants as a matter of law, and the burden was on the industrial special indemnity fund to show that some kind of suitable work was regularly and continuously available to the claimant. Lyons v. Industrial Special Indem. Fund, 98 Idaho 403, 565 P.2d 1360 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a claimant whose injury in the course of his employment aggravated an existing injury to his back had the equivalent of a twelfth-grade education, was in his mid-forties, had always done heavy labor, was unable to do such labor since the accident and consequently had not found permanent employment, and where the evidence indicated that there was no stable labor market for the type of work which the claimant could perform, the claimant had made out a prima facie case that he should be placed in the odd-lot category. Francis v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 98 Idaho 407, 565 P.2d 1364 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where worker suffered a back injury and had had two prior work-related back injuries, industrial commission correctly concluded that worker had not sustained the burden of proving that he fell in the odd-lot category; worker failed to establish the prima facie case of odd-lot status which was to prove the unavailability of suitable work, and there was evidence in the record that there was employment available for worker that he was capable of performing. Huerta v. School Dist. # 431, 116 Idaho 43, 773 P.2d 1130 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee sustained his burden of proving that while he was physically able to perform some work, he was so handicapped that he would not be employed regularly in any well-known branch of the labor market absent a business boom, the sympathy of a particular employer or friends, temporary good luck, or a superhuman effort on his part; this is the formulation of “odd-lot” worker. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
    Where estimates as to the portion of the jobs employee could have performed before his accident that he was precluded from performing after the accident ranged from 20 percent to 80 percent, the employee was not an “odd-lot” worker as a matter of law. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three methods by which the employee may prove a prima facie case of “odd-lot” status: (1) by showing what other types of employment the employee has attempted, (2) by showing that the employee, or vocational counselors, employment agencies, or the Job Service on behalf of the employee, have searched for other work for the employee, and that other work was not available, or (3) by showing that any efforts of the employee to find suitable employment would have been futile. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial and competent evidence to support the industrial commission’s findings that an employee did not establish a prima facie case that he was an odd-lot worker. Nelson v. David L. Hill Logging, 124 Idaho 855, 865 P.2d 946 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant sought permanent disability under the odd-lot status and there was conflict between testimony of claimant’s vocational counselor that claimant was not capable of performing any job and the testimony of company’s vocational expert that claimant was suitable for several types of jobs, since commission found the testimony of company’s vocational expert to be more credible and persuasive, claimant’s claim was denied and claimant’s argument that company expert’s evaluation should not be persuasive because there are no specific jobs available in the categories for which she found him to be qualified was without merit, for it has never been held that unless a prima facie case of odd-lot disability is established, an employer or ISIF must prove that there is a specific job in existence in order to defeat a claim for total or permanent disability. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant sought compensation for total and permanent disability under the definition of odd-lot worker and the evidence of claimant’s vocational expert was that claimant was not capable of performing any type of job, but company’s expert was of the opinion that even with claimant’s partial disability there were still jobs he could perform, the questions of whether claimant was an odd-lot worker became a question of fact for the commission to decide. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant for total disability failed to show that he had attempted other types of employment, that he did little to find work after leaving company, met with his vocational counselor only once, inquired about only a few jobs, and never sought employment in the area, and there was a conflict in the evidence about whether attempts to find employment would have been futile, he failed to establish odd-lot worker status. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee may prove total disability under the odd-lot worker doctrine in one of three ways: 1. by showing that he has attempted other types of employment without success; 2. by showing that he or vocational counselors or employment agencies on his or her behalf have searched for other work and other work is not available; 3. by showing that any efforts to find suitable employment would be futile. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proving a prima facie case of odd-lot status is on the claimant; however, where a dispute exists as to the extent of disability, the type of work the claimant is capable of performing, and the effort made to find suitable employment, whether the claimant is odd-lot status is a factual determination within the discretion of the commission. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
    A claimant may establish a prima facie case of odd-lot disability status as a matter of law only if the evidence is undisputed and is reasonably susceptible to only one interpretation. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).

       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the employee was determined to be additionally impaired due to thigh atrophy, as well as the temporal proximity of the additional restrictions of the most recent accident, it was reasonable to find that the most recent accident was the source of the additional impairment and to conclude that the most recent accident combined with the previous conditions to place the employee within the odd lot classification. Fowble v. Snoline Express, Inc., 146 Idaho 70, 190 P.3d 889 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant had been working prior to his last accident and, but for that last accident, he would have continued to be employable, the commission was correct in finding that the claimant was totally and permanently disabled solely by the final injury, pursuant to the odd-lot doctrine, and that it was the final injury which combined with his age and skills to render him unemployable. Stoddard v. Hagadone Corp., 147 Idaho 186, 207 P.3d 162 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho industrial commission properly held that the Idaho industrial special indemnity fund was not liable for an employee’s permanent total disability benefits under subsection (1), because the employer failed to prove that the employee’s last accident by itself did not render the employee totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot doctrine.

        A claimant can establish total, permanent disability by showing his or her medical impairment, together with all nonmedical factors, total 100 percent disability or by showing that he or she fits within the definition of an odd-lot worker. An “odd-lot worker” is one who, as a result of the injury, is impaired to an extent that his or her ability to perform services is so limited in quality, quantity, or dependability that no reasonable market for his or her services exists.

       <p>
        “Permanent physical impairment” is any permanent condition which reasonably could constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or reemployment and such hindrance would exist if the preexisting permanent condition would reasonably cause a potential employer to be reluctant to hire a person because of concerns that the person’s preexisting condition would make him a less capable worker, a greater risk in terms of getting injured, or a greater risk in terms of the amount of potential permanent disability that the worker would suffer from an injury; however, actual hindrance to one’s attempts at obtaining employment is not required. Curtis v. Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office, 102 Idaho 300, 629 P.2d 696 (1981).
    While the claimant’s attitude toward the condition is some evidence whether it was a hindrance, the claimant’s attitude does not necessarily play a decisive role in determining whether a “permanent physical impairment” exists under subsection (2) of this section. Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a “permanent physical impairment” exists under this section, evidence of the claimant’s attitude toward the preexisting condition, the claimant’s medical condition before and after the injury or disease for which compensation is sought, nonmedical factors concerning the claimant, as well as expert opinions and other evidence concerning the effect of the preexisting condition on the claimant’s employability will all be admissible. No longer will the result turn merely on the claimant’s attitude toward the condition and expert opinion concerning whether a reasonable employer would consider the claimant’s condition to make it more likely that any subsequent injury would make the claimant totally and permanently disabled; the result now will be determined by the commission’s weighing of the evidence presented on the question of whether or not the preexisting condition constituted a hindrance or obstacle to employment for the particular claimant. Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).

       <p>
        The proper standard for the industrial commission to apply in cases determining whether a claimant had a preexisting permanent physical impairment constituting a hindrance or obstacle to employment is an objective standard which determines whether the condition reasonably could constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or reemployment, as opposed to a showing of actual hindrance. Shea v. Bader, 102 Idaho 697, 638 P.2d 894 (1981) (decision prior to 1978 and 1981 amendments).

       <p>
        A party asserting that the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) should be apportioned liability under this section, bears the burden of proving that an employee was suffering from a permanent physical impairment; the four elements of a prima facie case for apportioning liability for total and permanent disability are (1) whether there was a preexisting impairment, (2) whether the impairment was manifest, (3) whether the impairment was a subjective hindrance, and (4) whether the impairment in any way combines in causing total and permanent disability. Wagar v. ASARCO, Inc., 127 Idaho 928, 908 P.2d 1235 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a preexisting permanent physical impairment must constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or re-employment in order to be apportionable to the industrial special indemnity fund in a 100% disability case as provided for under this section, it need not be a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or re-employment to constitute an apportionable preexisting physical impairment in cases involving less than total disability, as provided for under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§ 72-406</a></cite>(1).

        Where claimant’s consolidated claims encompassed two independent work-related injuries caused by two separate accidents at different places of employment, and two non-work-related conditions for which compensation was sought, the industrial commission erred in apportioning liability based upon the impact of an injury which was not “preexisting” within the meaning of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c03s72-332" target="_self">§ 72-332</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Where a claimant for disability compensation had previously been injured prior to taking the employment which caused the injury for which he was seeking compensation, such preexisting condition need not have actually hindered his efforts to obtain employment in the past in order to constitute a preexisting “permanent physical impairment” under subsection (2) of this section since “permanent physical impairment” is based on the effect the condition is likely or reasonably anticipated to have on obtaining employment. Gugelman v. Pressure Treated Timber Co., 102 Idaho 356, 630 P.2d 148 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant’s preexisting arthritic condition, which was subsequently aggravated by a work-related accident, was latent and asymptomatic, and thus not a hindrance to employment or reemployment under subsection (2) of this section, the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) was not liable for any disability resulting from the preexisting condition. Jones v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 104 Idaho 337, 659 P.2d 91 (1983).
    Where an accident caused a flare-up of claimant’s preexisting condition of rheumatoid arthritis and the aggravation of this condition caused him to become totally and permanently disabled, the claimant was entitled to permanent total disability income benefits from the industrial special indemnity fund. The industrial special indemnity fund’s obligation to the claimant was reduced by the permanent impairment and disability caused by the accidental injury. Waltman v. Associated Food Stores, Inc., 109 Idaho 273, 707 P.2d 384 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the claimant had a permanent partial impairment of 40% in the form of psychogenic pain syndrome, caused by the effects of the claimant’s injury as it acted upon her preexisting personality disorder, the claimant did not have a preexisting permanent physical impairment as that term has been interpreted under this section. Bruce v. Clear Springs Trout Farm, 109 Idaho 311, 707 P.2d 422 (1985).
       </p>

        While a preexisting permanent physical impairment must constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or re-employment in order to be apportionable to the industrial special indemnity fund in a 100% disability case as provided for under this section, it need not be a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or re-employment to constitute an apportionable preexisting physical impairment in cases involving less than total disability, as provided for under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§ 72-406</a></cite>(1).

       <p>
        Where the industrial commission found that claimant’s later employment by department of parks was essentially the equivalent of work provided by a sympathetic employer or friend and this conclusion was supported by the record, the finding that claimant was odd-lot totally permanently disabled prior to her most recent injury and the total permanent disability did not result from combined effects was affirmed. Bybee v. State, Indus. Special Indemnity Fund, 129 Idaho 76, 921 P.2d 1200 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant suffered a series of injuries, and employer was held responsible for the portion of an earlier injury that was caused by industrial accident, the claim for which was resolved before apportionment was determined and before a classification of “preexisting impairment” could be made, but that injury was medically stable before a subsequent injury was incurred, the industrial commission was able to make a determination that the earlier injury was ultimately preexisting. Quincy v. Quincy, 136 Idaho 1, 27 P.3d 410 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant was totally and permanently disabled prior to her 2002 injuries, those injuries could not increase her permanent disability, and no additional disability could be apportioned to those injuries under this section.

        A preexisting physical impairment within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section is any condition which reasonably could constitute a hindrance or obstacle to employment or reemployment when all known facts are or could reasonably be disclosed to the employer. Royce v. Southwest Pipe, 103 Idaho 290, 647 P.2d 746 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer knowledge is not a requirement to constitute a preexisting physical impairment. However, to constitute a “hindrance to employment” the condition must be manifest; “manifest” means that either the employer or employee is aware of the condition so that the condition can be established as existing prior to the injury. Royce v. Southwest Pipe, 103 Idaho 290, 647 P.2d 746 (1982).
    Where a colloid cyst was undoubtedly present in the claimant’s brain prior to his accident, but the cyst was asymptomatic prior to the accident and neither the claimant nor anyone else had any indication that the cyst existed, nor did the cyst adversely affect the claimant prior to the accident, and the testimony of doctors in the compensation action indicated that while the accident did not cause the occurrence of the cyst, it was common for such lesions to become symptomatic incident to head trauma and that the head trauma sustained by the claimant in the accident triggered the onset of clinical symptoms, the claimant’s condition was not a preexisting physical impairment within the meaning of this section, and consequently, the employer and its surety were liable for the full amount of the claimant’s disability benefits. Royce v. Southwest Pipe, 103 Idaho 290, 647 P.2d 746 (1982).

        A preexisting physical impairment within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section is any condition which reasonably could constitute a hindrance or obstacle to employment, when all facts were disclosed, or reasonably could be disclosed, to the employer; actual hindrance to employment is not a prerequisite to a finding of a preexisting physical impairment and an objective test must be utilized.

       </p>

        The findings of the industrial commission on the issue of subjective hindrance should have focused on whether or not claimant’s preexisting condition constituted a hindrance or obstacle to employment for the particular claimant.

        The basic definition of permanent impairment is “any anatomic or functional abnormality or loss” and claimant’s brachysyndactylism was a preexisting physical impairment with this definition. Hoye v. Daw Forest Prods., Inc., 125 Idaho 582, 873 P.2d 836 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        An impairment, the claim for benefits on which is an open, unresolved, and viable claim at the time of a subsequent injury, and which had not reached medical stability at the time of the subsequent injury, does not constitute a preexisting injury under the worker’s compensation statutes.

        Industrial commission did not err in apportioning claimant employee’s disability between the employer and the industrial special indemnity fund because the employee’s permanent partial disability (PPD) ratings for prior injuries were adequately taken into account by using their associated pre-existing physical impairment (PPI) ratings.

        The purpose of second injury funds such as the special industrial indemnity fund is to encourage employers to hire partially incapacitated persons and to encourage partially incapacitated workers to seek employment. Curtis v. Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office, 102 Idaho 300, 629 P.2d 696 (1981) (decision prior to 1978 and 1981 amendments).
       </p>
       <p>
        The underlying policy of the fund is to allow an employer to hire a handicapped person with the obligation only to pay compensation for an industrial injury to the handicapped person such amount as the employer would have had to pay an employee who had not been handicapped, with the indemnity fund assuming responsibility for the balance of the total permanent disability. Royce v. Southwest Pipe, 103 Idaho 290, 647 P.2d 746 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        An examination of the policy behind the creation of the industrial special indemnity fund indicates that the employer’s liability for permanent partial impairment should not increase, simply because a claimant is totally and permanently disabled through application of the odd-lot doctrine because of injuries unrelated to the industrial accident; accordingly, the escalator provision of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-408" target="_self">§ 72-408</a></cite>(1) and (2) did not apply to the employer’s share of liability in a case where the employee suffered a 50 percent partial disability due to his injury, but was found to be totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot doctrine.

        Stability is a key factor to consider when determining if a preexisting impairment exists: Where a claimant’s previous injury becomes medically stable before he suffers the next injury, the industrial commission can correctly conclude that the first injury was a preexisting impairment; claims may need to be resolved individually to a certain extent before liability as a whole can be apportioned under this section.

        When an employee, who was industrially blind in his right eye, received an injury by accident which resulted in the loss of his left eye, he was entitled to recover compensation from the special indemnity fund. McDonald v. State Treasurer, 52 Idaho 535, 16 P.2d 988 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “industrially blind” was not defined in our law and its use was depreciated. No particular percentage of normal vision could or should have been used as a standard to constitute industrial blindness but each case had to depend upon its particular facts and circumstances. Kelley v. Prouty, 54 Idaho 225, 30 P.2d 769 (1934).

        Board in considering whether above surface work involved claimant in hazardous exposure to silica dust was entitled to admit evidence by employer of sampling of air where claimant worked, if conditions at the time of sampling were similar to conditions at the time of claimant’s work. Kernaghan v. Sunshine Mining Co., 73 Idaho 106, 245 P.2d 806 (1952).
    Board in determining whether claimant had been hazardously exposed to silica dust did not err in refusing to admit exhibits of minutes of union-management safety committee concerning dusty conditions in locations where claimant had worked, since exhibits constituted hearsay evidence.

        In proceeding involving the second injury fund the state treasurer was not a necessary party since he merely made disbursements from the funds, and therefore it was not necessary to give notice to the state treasurer of injury upon which claim against the fund was based.

     <p>
      Any claimant, employer or surety making a claim for benefits with the industrial special indemnity fund shall file a notice of claim with the manager not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date of filing of a complaint against the industrial special indemnity fund with the industrial commission seeking benefits from the industrial special indemnity fund. Such notice of claim shall include, but not be limited to, a detailed statement describing the disability claim and supporting documentation including relevant medical and vocational rehabilitation records. Failure to timely file a notice of claim with the manager shall require the involuntary dismissal of any complaint against the industrial special indemnity fund regarding the claim for benefits which the party seeking to join the industrial special indemnity fund may cause to be filed with the industrial commission. The manager shall evaluate the notice of claim and shall approve or deny the claim or make an offer of settlement within the sixty (60) day period. If, in the discretion of the manager, the notice of claim is determined to be incomplete, the manager may, upon written notice to the party seeking to join the industrial special indemnity fund, extend the time period for evaluation of the claim for a maximum of thirty (30) days in order to request the necessary documents and records. The manager shall approve or deny the claim or make an offer of settlement within the extended period.

        “Odd-Lot” Worker.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Employee sustained his burden of proving that while he was physically able to perform some work, he was so handicapped that he would not be employed regularly in any well-known branch of the labor market absent a business boom, the sympathy of a particular employer or friends, temporary good luck, or a superhuman effort on his part; this is the formulation of “odd-lot” worker. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where estimates as to the portion of the jobs employee could have performed before his accident that he was precluded from performing after the accident ranged from 20 percent to 80 percent, the employee was not an “odd-lot” worker as a matter of law. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employee satisfied his burden of showing a prima facie case of being an “odd-lot” worker, the burden then shifted to the employer and its surety to demonstrate the availability of regular employment within the employee’s capabilities. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three methods by which the employee may prove a prima facie case of “odd-lot” status: (1) by showing what other types of employment the employee has attempted, (2) by showing that the employee, or vocational counselors, employment agencies, or the Job Service on behalf of the employee, have searched for other work for the employee, and that other work was not available, or (3) by showing that any efforts of the employee to find suitable employment would have been futile.

        Claimant was not a partially disabled employee, for purposes of this section, at the time he refused to cross a picket line and return to work where his doctor was of the opinion that claimant didn’t have any permanent disability and had released him to work without any limitations and where claimant had been working for approximately three months before the strike was called; therefore, claimant was not precluded from receiving benefits for a subsequent finding of permanent partial disability because he refused to cross the picket line, which refusal resulted in his permanent replacement.

        Since the commission has the responsibility to approve lump sum settlement agreements and, in doing so, must determine that the settlement is in the best interest of the parties, it necessarily follows that the commission has jurisdiction to clarify a claimant’s rights under a lump sum settlement agreement that is presented for commission.

    A “change of condition” was not a sufficient ground for setting aside a lump sum settlement, since the effect of this section and section providing modification of awards and agreements was to make a lump sum settlement final and not subject to review.

        Where worker, after work related accident which affected his right hip, had a later injury to his left hip, shoulder, and back due to arthritis and spondylolisthesis, under this section, employer was liable only for the disability resulting from the injury to worker’s right hip; employer was not liable for any disability caused by impairments to the left hip, the two shoulders, or the back even though these impairments were a part of worker’s permanent disability under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-425" target="_self">§§ 72-425 </a></cite>and 72-430.

        Apportionment between industrial injuries and preexisting physical impairments under this section does not depend upon the pre-existing condition being a “hindrance or obstacle” to obtaining employment. Campbell v. Key Millwork & Cabinet Co., 116 Idaho 609, 778 P.2d 731 (1989).

        The industrial commission’s apportionment under this section must be explained with sufficient rationale to enable the supreme court to review whether the apportionment is supported by substantial and competent evidence. The application of the formula devised in
    Carey v. Clearwater County Rd. Dep’t
    , 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984), to apportionments under this section does not present substantial competent evidence to justify the apportionment that is made. Reiher v. American Fine Foods, 126 Idaho 58, 878 P.2d 757 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of the industrial commission mandated an apportionment under the statute as the employee suffered from extensive preexisting injuries as the result of his motorcycle accident from which he never recovered; the commission had evidence to support its finding that the employee’s permanent disability resulting from the industrial accident — inclusive of impairment — was 15%, for which the employer was liable. Seufert v. Larson, 137 Idaho 589, 51 P.3d 403 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission’s apportionment of the employee’s disability was improper where the commission’s apportionment was incorrectly done by mechanically applying the
    Carey
    formula. The supreme court stated that the commission needed to provide an analysis as to why disability should have been apportioned in the same ratio as impairment. Henderson v. Mc Cain Foods, Inc., 142 Idaho 559, 130 P.3d 1097 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers’ compensation case, a remand was necessary because there was no clear indication as to a benefit claimant’s permanent disability in light of the accident and her pre-existing conditions since the Idaho industrial commission failed to articulate both steps in making its apportionment after determining that there was a 5 percent permanent disability. The commission was required to evaluate the claimant’s disability according to the factors in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-430" target="_self">§ 72-430</a></cite>(1), make findings as to her permanent disability in light of all of her physical impairments, including pre-existing conditions, and then apportion the amount of the permanent disability attributable to the claimant’s accident.

        Apportioning disability under both<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c03s72-332" target="_self">§ 72-332</a></cite>(1) and subsection (1) of this section requires two steps. First, the industrial commission must determine the claimant’s disability when considering the pre-existing physical impairment(s) and the subsequent injury, and, second, it must then apportion disability between the injury and the pre-existing impairment(s). Christensen v. S.L. Start &amp; Assocs., 147 Idaho 289, 207 P.3d 1020 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not apply where there is no disability in excess of impairment, and, thus, the industrial commission is not required to use the two-step analysis set forth in

        It was not error for the commission to conclude that a claimant’s physical appearance and history of excessive alcohol consumption constituted pertinent nonmedical factors under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-425" target="_self">§§ 72-425 </a></cite>and 72-430, rather than physical impairments under either<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c03s72-332" target="_self">§ 72-332 </a></cite>or this section, where the industrial commission found that claimant’s physical appearance and history of excessive alcohol consumption did not hinder him in his earning capacity prior to the accident, where, since he was a teenager claimant had functioned in the manual labor market without suffering any loss of potential earning capacity, and where claimant’s physical appearance and history of excessive alcohol consumption had not served as a hindrance in that job market. Roberts v. Asgrow Seed Co., 116 Idaho 209, 775 P.2d 101 (1989).

    , 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984), applies in industrial special indemnity fund cases and should not be mechanically applied to all nonmedical apportionment issues; therefore, where the industrial commission applied the

        Where the evidence showed that the claimant suffered a heart attack during the course of his employment, but the only evidence presented to the industrial commission in support of its determination that the claimant suffered a permanent partial impairment of 50 percent of the whole person failed to consider a preexisting heart condition, such determination was not supported by the evidence. Johnson v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 108 Idaho 765, 702 P.2d 803 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a preexisting permanent physical impairment must constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or re-employment in order to be apportionable to the industrial special indemnity fund in a 100% disability case as provided for under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c03s72-332" target="_self">§ 72-332</a></cite>, it need not be a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or re-employment to constitute an apportionable preexisting physical impairment in cases involving less than total disability, as provided for under this section. Campbell v. Key Millwork &amp; Cabinet Co., 116 Idaho 609, 778 P.2d 731 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported industrial commission’s finding that although claimant was found to have a permanent disability of 30% of the whole person after his second injury, because most of his limitations existed prior to the second injury, the portion of claimant’s disability resulting from the second injury did not exceed the portion of the physical impairment rating of five percent attributable to that injury; the remainder of claimant’s disability rating accrued prior to the 1989 injury, thus insurer was not liable for that portion.

        Where employee suffered a back injury in an industrial accident and employee had incurred previous back injuries, the commission’s decision not to apportion employee’s permanent disability was nevertheless supported by substantial medical evidence where the first of orthopedic surgeon’s three letters indicated that all of employee’s lower back problems occurred while working for the employer although subsequent letters apportioned a small percentage of the disability to a preexisting condition.

       <p>
        Where claimant on March 30 injured his back and also injured back on November 8 following his return, the second accident only aggravated injury sustained in first accident, hence there was no need for a deduction or apportionment of liability since claim was for one injury.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the board had no substantial competent evidence, it was error to find against employer’s surety for 1955 that an exacerbation in 1955 was the result of an accident in that year, rather than as a result of an injury to claimant prior to 1955.

       </p>
       <p>
        The cause should have been remanded to the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] with direction to consider evidence as to what apportionment, if any, should have been made between back injuries known to have been sustained in 1958 and recurrence of the situation in 1961 when back pain arose when claimant was lifting a large sack of potatoes since a determination of the question as to whether apportionment should be made is material and necessary to the decision of this case. Andrus v. Boise Fruit & Produce Co., 84 Idaho 245, 371 P.2d 256 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was authorized and required to find the causes of disability if attributable to more than one factor and to apportion the disability accordingly. This may have required apportionment between an industrial injury and a preexisting injury or infirmity as well as between successive industrial injuries; and such included apportionment of hospital, medical and kindred expenses. Clark v. Brennan Constr. Co., 84 Idaho 384, 372 P.2d 761 (1962).
    The industrial accident board [now industrial commission], specializing in the hearing of industrial accident cases, had to be presumed by its experience to be able to judge the causative factors in a particular case. The board had to be allowed a degree of latitude in making the apportionment. Clark v. Brennan Constr. Co., 84 Idaho 384, 372 P.2d 761 (1962).

       <p>
        In awarding compensation for back injuries received in 1960 and 1963, failure to apportion compensation to nondisabling back injuries received prior to 1960 was not error where there was no competent evidence that the pre-1960 injuries contributed to the claimant’s disability.

        Where the board found that a prior injury from which the claimant no longer was suffering disability contributed to the disability resulting from a second injury and that part of the required surgery was due to the first injury, it was proper to apportion both the disability and the medical expenses between the two employers.

        Section providing deductions for preexisting injuries and infirmities was constitutional, and did not violate the constitution with respect to the requirement that every act should embrace but one subject, and that should be expressed in the title.

       <p>
        The workmen’s compensation law authorizing deductions for preexisting injuries and infirmities in computing compensation, if the degree or duration of disability resulting from the accident was increased, did not apply to an award for death, since the word “disability” as used in the statute did not include “death.” Bishop v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 64 Idaho 806, 137 P.2d 963 (1943).

        Where there was circumstantial evidence that a workman with preexisting heart disease received an electric shock from exposed wires, which precipitated his death, the finding of the board that his death was due one-half to heart disease and one-half to electric shock would not be reversed on appeal. Gjerning v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 91 Idaho 15, 415 P.2d 301 (1966).

        Where a deputy sheriff with preexisting hypertension with atherosclerosis suffered a fatal stroke as a result of physical exertion and emotional strain in performing his duties at the scene of an accident, the board properly apportioned the cause of his death two-thirds to his preexisting condition and one-third to his cerebral “accident.” Hammond v.

        While an order for the employer to furnish medical services and surgery required because of a compensable injury to a claimant who was engaged in full-time employment was proper, notwithstanding an old injury, consideration was required to be given to the old injury in determining what was a reasonable time for the employer’s continuing to furnish such medical services and surgery.

       <p>
        Although laborer may have had injury or preexisting physical weakness which reduced his ability to work below that of normal man, and was thereby more susceptible to injury, yet if he was able to do some work and in course of his employment was injured, he was entitled to compensation. In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute prescribed no standard of fitness, made no distinction between sound and unsound, which being true, compensation was not based on implied warranty of perfect health or immunity from latent or unknown tendencies to disease. In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929).
    Finding that aggravation of preexisting disease was not any different or of any greater extent than might have resulted from ordinary physical activity did not justify denial of compensation. Hanson v. Independent Sch. Dist. 11-J, 50 Idaho 81, 294 P. 513 (1930); Strouse v. Hercules Mining Co., 51 Idaho 7, 1 P.2d 203 (1931); Scarborough v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the employee’s blood vessels were in a weakened condition as a result of disease would not prevent the award of compensation, if a strain, while working, resulted in a rupture of such vessels, thereby causing hemorrhage. Fealka v. Federal Mining & Smelting Co., 53 Idaho 362, 24 P.2d 325 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        A preexisting faulty condition of the heart of an employee, under the well-known rule so often reiterated by the supreme court of Idaho, would not defeat or prevent compensation, and this was particularly true where the testimony of all of the physicians testifying was reasonably clear, that the accidental injury had a deleterious effect upon a defective heart which perforce led to the conclusion that there was such causal connection as to entitle claimant to compensation. Soran v. McKelvey, 57 Idaho 483, 67 P.2d 906 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding to the effect that claimant’s condition was aggravated and made worse by reason of the accident, the evidence showing that a miner suffered from sciatic rheumatism after a former injury, but after such injury, he worked at hard manual labor for a number of years until receiving the injury for which compensation was claimed. Taylor v. Federal Mining & Smelting Co., 59 Idaho 183, 81 P.2d 728 (1938).
       </p>

        Nothing was contained in the workmen’s compensation law that limited its provisions to workmen who, previous to injury, were in sound condition and perfect health. Miller v. Bingham County, 79 Idaho 87, 310 P.2d 1089 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        If liability was to stem from an increase of a preexisting injury or infirmity it had to be established by substantial evidence that an unexpected, untoward event or circumstance produced such exacerbation. Beard v. Post Co., 82 Idaho 38, 348 P.2d 939 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section providing deductions for preexisting injuries and infirmities was not applicable to a case where the applicant, prior to her injury, had an operation for removal of a protruding disc, from which she made a satisfactory recovery. Arnold v. Splendid Bakery, 88 Idaho 455, 401 P.2d 271 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section providing deductions for preexisting injuries and infirmities had no application to a claim for loss of an eye by enucleation where the claimant had previously lost 90% of the vision of such eye but such loss of vision in no way contributed to the necessity for the enucleation of the eye. Gentry v. Bano, Inc., 91 Idaho 790, 430 P.2d 681 (1967).

        The supreme court ordered an award in favor of claimant for the amount of compensation to which he was entitled under the statutes in proceeding brought where total loss of vision had been sustained as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, the court holding the evidence did not sustain a finding that such workman was not totally and permanently disabled.

        The compensation of an employee who, prior to his injury, was totally blind in his right eye and had 20% vision in his left eye corrected to 85% with glasses and who was rendered totally blind by his injury was for permanent total disability with specific indemnity being paid by the employer for the loss of the sight of the left eye undiminished by the fact that his vision in that eye uncorrected by glasses was only 20% prior to the injury and the balance being paid from the special indemnity fund.

        Odd-Lot Doctrine.
       </h5>
       <p>
        An examination of the policy behind the creation of the industrial special indemnity fund indicates that the employer’s liability for permanent partial impairment should not increase, simply because a claimant is totally and permanently disabled through application of the odd-lot doctrine because of injuries unrelated to the industrial accident; accordingly, the escalator provision of subdivision (1) or (2) of this section did not apply to the employer’s share of liability in a case where the employee suffered a 50 percent partial disability due to his injury, but was found to be totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot doctrine. Carey v. Clearwater County Rd. Dep’t, 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984).

        Partial Permanent Disability.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Once a claimant’s condition is stabilized and his disability is rated, his benefits are calculated differently: If the disability is total, it is still computed by the “currently applicable average weekly state wage” of subdivision (1) or (2) of this section, but if it is a partial permanent disability, it is calculated under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-428" target="_self">§ 72-428</a></cite>, which makes no reference to the “currently applicable” average weekly state wage of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section. Hence, the legislature intended benefits for partial permanent disability to be fixed and quantifiable. Partial permanent disability benefits are not, nor are they intended to be, whole-life benefits. Carey v. Clearwater County Rd. Dep’t, 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision of the industrial commission awarding the claimant a permanent partial impairment rating of two and one-half percent of the whole man and denying the claimant retraining was supported by the evidence where the substantial medical evidence indicated no positive objective orthopedic findings nor any neurologic abnormalities and other evidence indicated the claimant’s ability to return to work at least in a related field, and that he would suffer no income loss as a result of the industrial accident.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a worker was injured, he was entitled to so-called temporary income benefits during the period of recovery, this section, but Idaho’s worker’s compensation statutes did not define the period of recovery, but it ended when the worker was medically stable, and the issue of maximum medical improvement was properly before the referee.

        Idaho industrial commission properly held that an employee, who sustained an accident on January 9, 2008, was only entitled to temporary total disability and medical care benefits for care provided up to February 19, 2008; as substantial evidence supported the conclusion that, as of that date, she had reached medical stability for the injury she suffered in the accident.

        Where claimant testified as to statements made to him by his doctors indicating his physical impairment, but did not support his testimony with doctor’s reports, depositions or a physician’s oral testimony, his testimony did not constitute medical testimony which was necessary to support his claim for compensation; as a result, he failed to satisfy the burden required in order to establish his eligibility for total temporary disability benefits. Sykes v. C.P. Clare & Co., 100 Idaho 761, 605 P.2d 939 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a claimant establishes by medical evidence that he is still within the period of recovery from the original industrial accident, he is entitled to total temporary disability benefits unless and until evidence is presented that he has been medically released for light work and that (1) his former employer has made a reasonable and legitimate offer of employment to him which he is capable of performing under the terms of his light work release and which employment is likely to continue throughout his period of recovery, or that (2) there is employment available in the general labor market which the claimant has a reasonable opportunity of securing and which employment is consistent with the terms of his light duty work release.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was no statutory provision under the workmen’s compensation law requiring the employer or surety to bring an action or proceeding to establish nondisability. It was true that if the parties were not agreed that disability had in fact ceased, then it became a matter of fact to be determined by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission].

        The workmen’s compensation law addresses dependency not in terms of “legal” dependency but rather “actual” dependency; accordingly, “actually dependent” as used in subsection (4) of this section means dependent in fact, not dependent by law. Hayes v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 104 Idaho 279, 658 P.2d 950 (1983).
    Where the evidence presented showed that the workmen’s compensation claimant was wholly dependent on her deceased son for support as of the date of his death and that the claimant was not receiving food stamps or any other type of support from state or federal agencies, the evidence supported the commission’s finding that the claimant was entitled to benefits as an actual dependent of her deceased son, notwithstanding the fact that the son was killed on only his third day of work and had not yet received a single paycheck from his employer. Hayes v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 104 Idaho 279, 658 P.2d 950 (1983).

        An agreement of the employer and his surety to pay a child compensation, after being approved by the board, had the same effect as an award. It was not subject to review on appeal on the grounds of a change in conditions, alleging that the child was of illegitimate birth, in the absence of fraud in the inception of the agreement. Rodius v. Coeur d’Alene Mill Co., 46 Idaho 692, 271 P. 1 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a report of a school district fixed the compensation of the janitor’s wife at $35.00 per month “plus room, heat, and light,” she was receiving more than the minimum wage essential to an award of $6.00 per week, and the evidence of the work actually performed by the janitor’s wife, and the wages paid by the school district, coupled with such statement of the school board, justified the award of $6.00 per week to a minor child by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission]. Larson v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 11-J, 53 Idaho 49, 22 P.2d 299 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employee, after marriage to the mother of children by prior marriage, assumed the responsibility of a father to the children, and they were known and called by the employee’s name at his request, they were his “dependents” at the time of his injury and death within the meaning of the compensation act. Nicholas v. Idaho Power Co., 63 Idaho 675, 125 P.2d 321 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stepchildren of deceased employee were properly included in award along with wife of employee though father of stepchildren was required to pay $100 per month for their support and children were living with their father at time of employee’s death. Sanders v. Ray, 67 Idaho 200, 174 P.2d 836 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        For the purpose of death benefits, the statute defined dependents as including a child if under 18 years of age or incapable of self-support and unmarried, whether actually dependent upon the deceased or not, which relationship must have existed at the time of the accident. In re Jones, 84 Idaho 327, 372 P.2d 406 (1962).

        Dependency Question of Fact.
       </h5>
       <p>
        What constituted actual dependency was a question of fact and each case must have rested and been decided upon its own particular facts and circumstances. In re Konin, 69 Idaho 28, 202 P.2d 239 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legal obligation to support, standing alone, would not establish actual dependency. In re Konin, 69 Idaho 28, 202 P.2d 239 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether widow who had been separated from her husband for three years at the time of his death was wholly or partially dependent, the test should not be whether the claimant could have existed without the aid he supplied but rather whether the assistance given by decedent was substantial and whether it enabled his family to enjoy a better life than they could have without such help and assistance. In re Haynes, 95 Idaho 492, 511 P.2d 309 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant and decedent had been separated three years prior to decedent’s death, evidence that claimant used decedent’s credit card to purchase gas, that decedent had made four or five car payments on claimant’s car, had paid claimant’s auto insurance for a portion of the time after their separation, had paid various medical bills for claimant and their daughter and had sent cash to claimant on numerous occasions when she so requested was sufficient to show that decedent had given substantial assistance to claimant during their separation thereby entitling her to benefits. In re Haynes, 95 Idaho 492, 511 P.2d 309 (1973).

       <p>
        Where an application for compensation for the death of a husband stated that the claimant bore the relationship of spouse to the deceased and was actually and wholly dependent upon him for support on the day of the accident, and the answer of the employer admitted this paragraph, but thereafter filed an amendment and alleged that “The claimant Lillian R. Bocock is not a dependent widow under the purview of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of Idaho,” this was not the equivalent of an allegation that she was neither dependent on her husband nor living with him at the time of the accident, and was insufficient to defeat her right to compensation upon that issue. Bocock v. State Bd. of Educ., 55 Idaho 18, 37 P.2d 232 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the husband, during his lifetime, did not contribute much to the support of his wife and family, but did make some small contributions, and they temporarily lived at different places, in order to obtain lodging and the necessaries of life, it did not render the wife and children any the less the dependents of the husband. Smith v. McHan Hdwe. Co., 56 Idaho 43, 48 P.2d 1102 (1935).
    In a case where a claimant asserted that she was married to deceased employee, her prior marriage was not material on the question of whether she was the widow of the deceased. Mauldin v. Sunshine Mining Co., 61 Idaho 9, 97 P.2d 608 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to establish a marriage between deceased and claimant for compensation, since the law will presume morality, and not immorality, marriage, and not concubinage, legitimacy, and not bastardy: when a marriage has been shown in evidence, whether regular or irregular, and whatever the form of proof, the law comes to its aid with a strong presumption of its legality, casting the burden of proof upon the party objecting and requiring him in every particular to make plain against the constant pressure of such presumption, the truth of law and fact that the marriage is illegal. Mauldin v. Sunshine Mining Co., 61 Idaho 9, 97 P.2d 608 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere proof that the husband made his appearance in his wife’s divorce action, that no divorce was ever granted in that action, and that the action was dismissed did not prove that the husband was alive or undivorced from his wife at the time of her subsequent marriage to another, and did not preclude the wife’s recovery of compensation under the compensation act for the death of the second husband. Nicholas v. Idaho Power Co., 63 Idaho 675, 125 P.2d 321 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a husband entered into consent marriage at a time when his first wife was still living, and continued in such second marital relation, and he and the second wife conducted themselves as husband and wife after the divorce decree from the first wife had become final, and in application for employment the husband named the second wife as his wife, such second wife was the husband’s “widow” on his death, and entitled to workmen’s compensation. Morrison v. Sunshine Mining Co., 64 Idaho 6, 127 P.2d 766 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant wife could not recover unless “actually dependent” either wholly or in part, upon the deceased husband at time of accident resulting in death; since it was undisputed that they had not lived together for a number of years, prior to his death, the burden of proof was upon such claimant to establish actual dependency. In re Konin, 69 Idaho 28, 202 P.2d 239 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence showing claimant widow had not been supported by decedent during the short time they lived together nor after their separation, and showing that she neither expected nor anticipated receipt of financial assistance from decedent or that by his death she lost anything she was receiving or might have received, justified the board in finding that claimant was not actually dependent upon decedent at time of his death. In re Konin, 69 Idaho 28, 202 P.2d 239 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute which provided that a judgment of nullity of a marriage rendered was conclusive only as against the parties thereto or claiming under them, could not be invoked to prevent a wife of a deceased first husband from obtaining benefit rights after a second marriage was annulled because the second husband had an undivorced wife at the time of marriage. Duncan v. Jacobsen Constr. Co., 83 Idaho 254, 360 P.2d 987 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section defining dependents and providing for entitlement to compensation clearly contemplated a valid and subsisting marriage adjudicated as void ab initio. Duncan v. Jacobsen Constr. Co., 83 Idaho 254, 360 P.2d 987 (1961).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was a mother having a number of sons all of whom lived on a farm except one, and he worked and contributed to her support, she was dependent. Gloubitz v. Smeed Bros., 53 Idaho 7, 21 P.2d 78 (1933).
    Where the evidence showed that a deceased employee helped his parents build a barn on their ranch, painted it, installed complete plumbing fixtures in the house, built a septic tank, and drainage system, painted the house, built a woodshed, maintained a water-pumping system, serviced the engine, purchased and cared for a cream separator, worked upon the ranch, and made voluntary contributions to assist them, helped pay for the ranch, performed labor in planting and harvesting the crops, helped purchase a horse and a binder and other farm equipment, and employed a man to take his place upon the ranch and paid him his wages, it was sufficient to sustain an award to the parents upon the theory that they were partially dependent upon him. Miller v. G.L. Arnett & Son, 58 Idaho 420, 74 P.2d 177 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that the employee had helped on his father’s farm and later on contributed money from his earnings, which was necessary to the support of the father, this was sufficient to establish the father’s dependency, and this was true notwithstanding the fact that there was no note of such dependency on the employee’s identification card. Chambers v. State ex rel. Parsons, 59 Idaho 200, 81 P.2d 748 (1938).
       </p>

        It was not necessary in order to establish that a parent or grandparent was dependent upon the deceased employee, to prove a contractual obligation on the part of the employee to that effect. Chambers v. State ex rel. Parsons, 59 Idaho 200, 81 P.2d 748 (1938).

       </p>

        Where a report of a school district fixed the compensation of the janitor’s wife at $35.00 per month “plus room, heat, and light,” she was receiving more than the minimum wage essential to an award of $6.00 per week, and the evidence of the work actually performed by the janitor’s wife, and the wages paid by the school district, coupled with such statement of the school board, justified the award of $6.00 per week to a minor child by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission].

        Where the wife of deceased employee testified that she kept an account of her husband’s earnings, and that he gave her his checks and had earned $663.60 from March until August for the work he did for different employers; and gave testimony as to the amount decedent received each day; testifying that he received 40 cents per hour from the employer whom decedent was working for at time of death, and this was corroborated by another; such evidence was sufficient to sustain an award for the minimum amount.

        Because the intent of the statutes is to provide for loss of monetary support, it is both rational and reasonable for the legislature to limit benefits to those individuals who were truly dependent on the deceased worker. Therefore, by leaving independent adult children of deceased workers benefitless, this section did not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Meisner v. Potlatch Corp., 131 Idaho 258, 954 P.2d 676 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 818, 119 S. Ct. 56, 142 L. Ed. 2d 44 (1998).

        Death resulting concurrently from injury by an accident and a preexisting disease entitled dependents to death benefits. In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929); In re Soran, 57 Idaho 483, 67 P.2d 906 (1937); In re Cain, 64 Idaho 389, 133 P.2d 723 (1943); Bishop v.

        The fact that an employee had a heart condition, prior to his injury, would not defeat the right to compensation for his death through aggravation of the heart condition, by a back injury sustained while employed. Soran v. McKelvey, 57 Idaho 483, 67 P.2d 906 (1937).
       </p>

        Where board erroneously computed death benefits, award was sustained but case was remanded with direction to compute benefits under the statute making last employer liable. Goaslind v. Pocatello, 61 Idaho 435, 102 P.2d 650 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Injured workman under treatment for compensable injury with arm in plaster cast was precipitated into water from capsized boat on a fishing trip. It was held that capsizing of boat, not the initial injury, was proximate cause of death. Linder v. Payette, 64 Idaho 656, 135 P.2d 440 (1943).

       <p>
        Cause of death was a question of fact for board’s determination. Bishop v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 64 Idaho 806, 137 P.2d 963 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where death followed soon after an injury to an able-bodied man, there arose a presumption or natural inference that the death was caused by the injury, in the absence of believed contrary testimony, and even though the only doctor who testified stated that there was no causal relation, an award to a claimant had to stand, as the doctor may have been disbelieved and causal relation inferred from the rest of the evidence. Stralovich v. Sunshine Mining Co., 68 Idaho 524, 201 P.2d 106 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sudden death of able-bodied employee while doing light work in normal course of his employment was not compensable where board made no finding as to cause of death, since sudden death in itself was not an accident. Swan v. Williamson, 74 Idaho 32, 257 P.2d 552 (1953).

    Where a janitor and his wife both worked for a school district, and the wife was killed, a minor child was entitled to the minimum award of $6.00 per week for the death of its mother. Larson v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 11-J, 53 Idaho 49, 22 P.2d 299 (1933).

        Widow’s death or remarriage did not affect or impair the right of minors to receive compensation for the full period prescribed by statute. Hiebert v. Howell, 59 Idaho 591, 85 P.2d 699 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the mother of minor children neglected to make application for compensation where the father of the children had been killed, or even allowed the statute of limitations to run against her claim, the minors would still have had a right to petition for an award. Hiebert v. Howell, 59 Idaho 591, 85 P.2d 699 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employee was killed and his dependent wife and children were nonresidents of the state of Idaho, the widow may have prosecuted the claim for and on behalf of herself and the nonresident minor children, and it was not necessary, in order to recover compensation, that such minors be represented by a guardian or a guardian ad litem. Hiebert v. Howell, 59 Idaho 591, 85 P.2d 699 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The compensation act contemplated the award to the mother for herself and minor children, which, in the sound discretion of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], might all be paid to the widow and mother or be segregated, part to the mother and part to the children. In case of an award to the mother for herself and children, she might have collected it as it fell due, and the employer and insurance carrier were discharged pro tanto as each payment was made, but in case of separate awards, a guardian had to be appointed or designated to collect and disburse the minors’ share of the award. Hiebert v. Howell, 59 Idaho 591, 85 P.2d 699 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The minor children always had an interest in the award, such as would at any time give them a legal standing before the industrial accident board [now industrial commission]; it was the duty of the courts to protect their interest in the compensation, and if an award were made to the mother for their benefit, and it should appear later that she was dissipating the fund and not using any of it for their benefit, and was neglecting them, the minors would have an undoubted right to petition the board for an order directing their share of the compensation to be paid to a guardian for their use and benefit. Hiebert v. Howell, 59 Idaho 591, 85 P.2d 699 (1938).

        Service of notice of appeal by employer on widow and her attorney was sufficient notice to minor children of deceased employee and widow, since widow was authorized representative of the children. Mahon v. Pocatello, 75 Idaho 166, 269 P.2d 1075 (1954).

        Where, because of the shortness of time of the injured claimant’s employment, or from the nature of the employment, a rate of average weekly earnings cannot be practicably determined, a method for computation is provided by this section. However, where it appeared that the referee for the commission did not take into consideration this method of computation, the cause would be remanded back to the commission to again examine the issue.

        Where agreement between claimant and the industrial special indemnity fund stated that claimant would be paid monthly benefits at the statutory rate and recited claimant’s hourly wage at $5.06 per hour, and, furthermore, the agreement explicitly stated that “no portion is a mere recital,” the industrial commission correctly determined that the hourly wage recited in the agreement was the base rate to be used in computing claimant’s average weekly wage; if claimant believed that his hourly wage was something other than the $5.06 amount, the time to have raised this issue was during the settlement process or by way of a motion for rehearing or reconsideration. Drake v. State, Indus. Special Indemnity Fund, 128 Idaho 880, 920 P.2d 397 (1996).
    Paragraph (4)(a) calculates an employee’s weekly wage rate by splitting into four 13 week periods the employee’s wages earned in the 52 weeks previous to the injury; the wage period that is most favorable to the employee is then used in computing the employee’s benefits.

        Subdivision (9) of this section clearly contemplates the inclusion of a claimant’s earnings from part-time employment in calculating his preinjury wages or income, and since there was no contention that the employer liable for compensation was unaware of the claimant’s two part-time positions, the earnings from those part-time positions were properly included by the commission in its determination of the claimant’s total preinjury annual income.

        Where a report of a school district fixed the compensation of the janitor’s wife at $35.00 per month “plus room, heat, and light,” she was receiving more than the minimum wage essential to an award of $6.00 per week, and the evidence of the work actually performed by the janitor’s wife, and the wages paid by the school district, coupled with such statement of the school board, justified the award of $6.00 per week to a minor child by the industrial accident board. Larson v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 11-J, 53 Idaho 49, 22 P.2d 299 (1933).

       <p>
        In a workers’ compensation case, there was no error in finding a 1 percent permanent partial impairment due to a knee injury where the Idaho industrial commission was allowed to rely on a doctor’s rating in a deposition, despite sustaining an objection to the impairment rating at trial; moreover, the doctor was familiar with a benefit claimant’s condition, he performed surgery on the claimant’s torn meniscus, and his chart notes indicate the claimant’s torn meniscus had an impairment rating. The claimant did not show the doctor’s actual impairment rating, which at the time of the deposition was testimony the claimant solicited, lacked reliability or probative value such that the commission properly sustained an objection to this evidence. Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., 145 Idaho 302, 179 P.3d 265 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported a permanent partial disability rating: the industrial commission properly considered the claimant’s limited language skills, the labor market, and his chronic pain in determining his percentage of impairment and found that he was not an odd lot worker.

       <p>
        Although the term “impairment award” has crept into the vernacular of the workmen’s compensation bar, Idaho’s workmen’s compensation law only provides for an award of income benefits based on disability, not impairment. A “permanent impairment” as the definitions themselves make clear, is simply a component of a “permanent disability.” Mayer v. TPC Holdings, Inc., 160 Idaho 223, 370 P.3d 738 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        A worker was not entitled to a separate award for permanent partial disability and partial permanent impairment, because there was not a separate avenue for recovery of both impairment and disability under the worker’s compensation act, as impairment is included in the determination of disability. Oliveros v. Rule Steel Tanks, Inc., — Idaho —, 438 P.3d 291 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        While impairment and disability are separately defined, there is no separate statutory mechanism authorizing separate awards for income benefits based on a claimant’s partial permanent impairment and his permanent partial disability ratings. Any monies paid based on impairment are, in actuality, payments for disability, and any payments or awards made before the final disability award are more accurately characterized as disability payments.

        Where worker wanted modification of compensation agreement, and where agreement blurred the distinction between impairment and disability, commission did not err in refusing to reopen the case concerning worker’s previous injury; worker had no basis to establish different percentage figures for impairment and disability since there was no evidence that the degree of impairment in 1979 was greater than 20%, since worker’s hip was relatively asymptomatic after the 1979 surgery, and since the record was silent as to any nonmedical factors, following the 1979 surgery, that could have caused the disability rating to deviate from the medically determined degree of impairment.

        Pain can produce “functional . . . loss” under this section; since it relates to functional loss, pain is a medical factor to be considered in determining impairment itself.

       <p>
        An impairment, the claim for benefits on which is an open, unresolved, and viable claim at the time of a subsequent injury, and which had not reached medical stability at the time of the subsequent injury, does not constitute a preexisting injury under the worker’s compensation statutes.

       <p>

       <p>
        The burden of proving a prima facie case of odd-lot status is on the claimant; however, where a dispute exists as to the extent of disability, the type of work the claimant is capable of performing, and the effort made to find suitable employment, whether the claimant is odd-lot status is a factual determination within the discretion of the commission. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant may establish a prima facie case of odd-lot disability status as a matter of law only if the evidence is undisputed and is reasonably susceptible to only one interpretation. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).

        Income benefits payable under the workmen’s compensation law, with the exception of retraining benefits, are based upon disability, either temporary or permanent, but not merely impairment. Fowler v. City of Rexburg, 116 Idaho 1, 773 P.2d 269 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        While in some cases nonmedical factors will not increase the permanent disability rating over the amount of the permanent impairment rating, the ultimate award of income benefits is based upon the permanent disability rating, not merely the impairment rating. Fowler v. City of Rexburg, 116 Idaho 1, 773 P.2d 269 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        While impairment and disability are separately defined, there is no separate statutory mechanism authorizing separate awards for income benefits based on a claimant’s partial permanent impairment and his permanent partial disability ratings. Any monies paid based on impairment are, in actuality, payments for disability, and any payments or awards made before the final disability award are more accurately characterized as disability payments.

        Where the evidence showed that the claimant, following his impairment and removal from the labor market as an ironworker due to a back injury, had educated and continued to educate himself for the purpose of teaching welding at a state university, and that the defendant employer had failed to establish that the claimant could earn more than he was earning in that teaching position, the commission properly found that the claimant’s 44% decrease in his wage-earning capacity from what he earned as an ironworker to what he earned as a teacher fully supported its award of a permanent partial disability equal to 44% of a whole man as a result of the back injury, even though the claimant’s permanent physical impairment rating was only equivalent to 15% of the whole man. Baldner v. Bennett’s, Inc., 103 Idaho 458, 649 P.2d 1214 (1982).
    Medical testimony that claimant had actual physical impairment of 8% and that she also suffered a 7% impairment caused by conversion reaction hysteria, which caused symptoms of the physical injury to continue even after the physical damage was repaired, supported commission finding of 15% disability rating and denial of total and permanent disability claim. Bartel v. J.R. Simplot Co., 106 Idaho 174, 677 P.2d 487 (1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of the award of temporary use of a hospital bed was not inconsistent with the determination that there was no permanent impairment from the accident in issue. Clark v. City of Lewiston, 133 Idaho 723, 992 P.2d 172 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers’ compensation case, there was no error in finding a 1 percent permanent partial impairment due to a knee injury where the Idaho industrial commission was allowed to rely on a doctor’s rating in a deposition, despite sustaining an objection to the impairment rating at trial; moreover, the doctor was familiar with a benefit claimant’s condition, he performed surgery on the claimant’s torn meniscus, and his chart notes indicate the claimant’s torn meniscus had an impairment rating. The claimant did not show the doctor’s actual impairment rating, which at the time of the deposition was testimony the claimant solicited, lacked reliability or probative value such that the commission properly sustained an objection to this evidence. Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., 145 Idaho 302, 179 P.3d 265 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission’s determination that the claimant had failed to prove that he had a disability in excess of his impairment was not clearly erroneous where the claimant’s treating physician, who had treated him for a period of years, did not assign any limitations or restrictions.

       </p>
       <p>
        Employer/surety was not required to establish an impairment rating as an element of its case prior to the initial industrial commission’s decision, as the commission can require the presentation of additional evidence to decide that issue. Green v. Green, 160 Idaho 275, 371 P.3d 329 (2016).

Whether the award was for permanent impairment or permanent disability is dependent on the actual agreement of the parties. Woodvine v. Triangle Dairy, Inc., 106 Idaho 716, 682 P.2d 1263 (1984).

        Where the evidence showed that the claimant suffered a heart attack during the course of his employment, but the only evidence presented to the industrial commission in support of its determination that the claimant suffered a permanent partial impairment of 50 percent of the whole person failed to consider a preexisting heart condition, such determination was not supported by the evidence. Johnson v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 108 Idaho 765, 702 P.2d 803 (1985).
    This section clearly suggests that subjective factors of pain and the claimant’s unique living conditions and lifestyle should be taken into account in arriving at a permanent impairment evaluation. Poss v. Meeker Mach. Shop, 109 Idaho 920, 712 P.2d 621 (1985).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Industrial commission need not accept the opinion of a claimant’s treating physician regarding pain and impairment despite the fact that evaluation of permanent impairment is a “medical appraisal” since the words “medical appraisal” cannot obscure the fundamental principle that the industrial commission, rather than the claimant’s treating physician, is the factfinder and the ultimate evaluator of impairment. Urry v. Walker & Fox Masonry Contractors, 115 Idaho 750, 769 P.2d 1122 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In making the “medical appraisal” of an injury’s effect on daily living activities, there is a potentially wide spectrum of material and relevant evidence worthy of consideration, beyond the particular opinion of a physician asked to give an impairment rating. Such evidence, whether it tends to refute or establish the existence of an impairment, has a place in the commission’s effort to ascertain truth. Moreover, evidence impeaching a claimant’s credibility, though coming from non-medical sources, need not be ignored in a permanent impairment hearing. Such evidence is particularly relevant where the claimant relies heavily on complaints of pain in asserting impairment. Soto v. J.R. Simplot, 126 Idaho 536, 887 P.2d 1043 (1994).

        A physician’s opinion as to the extent of impairment is advisory only and is not binding upon the commission. Baker v. Louisiana Pac. Corp., 123 Idaho 799, 853 P.2d 544 (1993).

       </p>
       <p>
        Physician opinions are not binding on the commission, but are advisory. To be sure, the expert opinion of a physician who gives a permanent impairment rating pursuant to AMA guidelines may prove more helpful to the commission or worthy of greater weight than that of a treating physician not asked to give an opinion on impairment. It does not follow, however, that reliable records and opinions of treating physicians are worthy of no consideration. It would be an improper invasion into the factfinding discretion of the industrial commission for the courts hold that the commission must always give greater weight to one party’s medical experts over the other.

        Evaluation of Permanent Disability.

        In evaluating permanent disability under this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-430" target="_self">§ 72-430</a></cite>, all physical impairments that were caused by the work-related injury and by all pre-existing impairments or physical conditions should be taken into account; otherwise, there would be no determination of disability that would permit an apportionment for pre-existing impairments under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§§ 72-406 </a></cite>and 72-332. Horton v. Garrett Freightlines, 115 Idaho 912, 772 P.2d 119 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The permanent disability evaluation outlined in this section was the first in a two-step process that preceded the analysis to determine whether any liability for the claimant’s total permanent disability would be apportioned to the defendant indemnity fund. Eckhart v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 133 Idaho 260, 985 P.2d 685 (1999).
    The evaluation of permanent disability includes consideration of all physical impairments that were caused by the claimant’s work-related injury and pre-existing impairments or physical conditions. Eckhart v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 133 Idaho 260, 985 P.2d 685 (1999).

        Evidence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the degree of permanent disability was a factual question committed to the particular expertise of the commission, there was no error in the commission’s action in considering a physician’s answer to an interrogatory concerning the percentage of claimant’s permanent partial disability over employer’s objection to the physician’s failure to separate the effect of a preexisting injury from the effect of the industrial accident. Thom v. Callahan, 97 Idaho 151, 540 P.2d 1330 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a claimant fell into the “odd-lot” category of workers who are physically able to perform some work but are so handicapped that they will not be employed regularly in any well-known branch of the labor market, the statutory requirement that the commission consider the economic and social environment in which a claimant lives in evaluating his disability would necessitate the introduction of evidence that there was an actual job within a reasonable distance from the claimant’s home which he was able to perform or for which he could be trained and which he had a reasonable opportunity to obtain. Lyons v. Industrial Special Indem. Fund, 98 Idaho 403, 565 P.2d 1360 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a claimant falls in the odd-lot category, it is improper for the commission to equate the rating of the claimant’s permanent impairment with its rating of his disability without explicit consideration of the types of employment the claimant can now perform. Francis v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 98 Idaho 407, 565 P.2d 1364 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        A witness who was generally familiar with the claimant’s physical condition and was experienced in the general area of industrial employment placement was competent to testify with respect to non-medical factors relevant to the claimant’s disability. Murray v. Hecla Mining Co., 98 Idaho 688, 571 P.2d 334 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was substantial though conflicting evidence, both of claimant’s ability to work and the availability of work, including testimony that claimant could work for a full day at a time in a sedentary-type job, that the area was a healthy labor market, considered good for female workers, and that there were sedentary jobs with training available as turnover created them within the labor market, the industrial commission did not err in its finding of fact which precluded the application of the “odd-lot” classification. Reifsteck v. Lantern Motel & Cafe, 101 Idaho 699, 619 P.2d 1152 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that the claimant, following his impairment and removal from the labor market as an ironworker due to a back injury, had educated and continued to educate himself for the purpose of teaching welding at a state university, and that the defendant employer had failed to establish that the claimant could earn more than he was earning in that teaching position, the commission properly found that the claimant’s 44% decrease in his wage-earning capacity from what he earned as an ironworker to what he earned as a teacher fully supported its award of a permanent partial disability equal to 44% of a whole man as a result of the back injury, even though the claimant’s permanent physical impairment rating was only equivalent to 15% of the whole man. Baldner v. Bennett’s, Inc., 103 Idaho 458, 649 P.2d 1214 (1982).
    The industrial commission did not err in failing to find a permanent disability in excess of ten percent of the whole person, where the claimant made no concrete showing of disability greater than the permanent impairment rating of ten percent. Smith v. Payette County, 105 Idaho 618, 671 P.2d 1081 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the testimony of the claimant indicated pre-injury she was earning $3.40 or $3.45 per hour, and post-injury was earning $3.35 per hour, and her complaint of chronic back pain and inability to work beyond five hours per day were met with testimony that there was no anatomical cause for her pain, no physical evidence of injury, and that the large bulk of her complaints were independent of the effects of the injury and attributable to other factors, there was substantial competent evidence supporting the decision of the industrial commission that claimant suffered a permanent partial disability of five percent. Seese v. Ideal of Idaho, Inc., 110 Idaho 32, 714 P.2d 1 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support the commission’s finding of a 35% permanent partial disability in excess of impairment. Baker v. Louisiana Pac. Corp., 123 Idaho 799, 853 P.2d 544 (1993).

       <p>
        The burden of proof is upon the claimant to prove disability in excess of his impairment rating, although expert testimony on this issue need not be presented; the test for such determination is not whether the claimant is able to work at some employment, but rather whether the physical impairment, taken in conjunction with nonmedical factors, has reduced the claimant’s capacity for gainful activity. Seese v. Ideal of Idaho, Inc., 110 Idaho 32, 714 P.2d 1 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employee failed to produce any substantial evidence bearing on the employee’s disability in excess of impairment, the court affirmed the commission’s order finding that the employee failed to meet her burden of proof.

       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission’s determination that the claimant had failed to prove that he had a disability in excess of his impairment was not clearly erroneous where the claimant’s treating physician, who had treated him over a period of time, did not assign any limitations or restrictions.

        Although medical panels did not specifically designate a portion of the impairment rating as based solely on pain, the reports of both panels clearly took into account claimant’s past complaints of pain; thus, there was competent evidence supporting the industrial commission’s finding that pain was a component of the impairment rating.

        Where worker, after work-related accident which affected his right hip, had a later injury to his left hip, shoulders and back due to arthritis and spondylolisthesis, commission should have included the impairments to worker’s left hip, his shoulders, and his back in making its evaluation of the degree of his total and permanent disability since the conditions that caused these impairments existed at the time of the injury to worker’s right hip; whether any of these impairments led to liability of employer and its surety or the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) depended on apportionment under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§§ 72-406 </a></cite>and 72-332.

       <p>
        The commission’s recitation that it has considered medical and nonmedical factors including the claimant’s age, sex, education, economic and social environment and training and usable skills in evaluating his disability is not a substitute for an explicit finding of what kind of suitable work is available to the claimant who is in the odd-lot category and such an explicit finding is required in that situation. Francis v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 98 Idaho 407, 565 P.2d 1364 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission’s reliance, on the fact that claimant in an attempt to provide his own means of employment purchased a truck in order to become an independent truck driver, was misplaced in determining that he was not entitled to disability compensation additional to his medical impairment rating, since he lost the money in the six months of his attempt to become an independent truck driver; this is an economic factor which tended to show that he was disabled in excess of his medical impairment, not a factor negating such an award. Bennett v. Clark Hereford Ranch, 106 Idaho 438, 680 P.2d 539 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error on the part of the commission to look at one two-week earning period after the claimant’s accident and conclude that because the claimant was earning more in this period, if computed on a yearly basis, than he did before his accident that he necessarily did not suffer a loss in his earning capacity or in ability to engage in gainful activity. Bennett v. Clark Hereford Ranch, 106 Idaho 438, 680 P.2d 539 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a claimant falls within the odd-lot category is a factual determination and it is the duty of the industrial commission to make this determination and the commission’s findings will not be set aside on appeal if based upon substantial and competent evidence; furthermore, it is the claimant’s burden to establish a prima facie case that he is a member of the odd-lot category.

       </p>
       <p>
        Claim that the industrial commission should have considered wage increases implemented by claimant’s former employer during the interim between his injury and subsequent employment with another employer was unsupported by law and too speculative as it could not be ascertained whether claimant would have continued working for former employer, or whether he would have received the same raises that current employees received. McClurg v. Yanke Mach. Shop, Inc., 123 Idaho 174, 845 P.2d 1207 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable future wage increases are speculative and unsupported by law unless the claimant is performing the act being used as the test pre-injury and post-injury; thus, where claimant’s employment activity changed after he was injured, any future wage increases that he may have received had he remained in his pre-injury employment activity were unascertainable and irrelevant.

        Where worker wanted modification of compensation agreement, and where agreement blurred the distinction between impairment and disability, commission did not err in refusing to reopen the case concerning worker’s previous injury; worker had no basis to establish different percentage figures for impairment and disability since there was no evidence that the degree of impairment in 1979 was greater than 20%, since worker’s hip was relatively asymptomatic after the 1979 surgery, and since the record was silent as to any nonmedical factors, following the 1979 surgery, that could have caused the disability rating to deviate from the medically determined degree of impairment.

        It was not error for the commission to conclude that a claimant’s physical appearance and history of excessive alcohol consumption constituted pertinent nonmedical factors under this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-430" target="_self">§ 72-430</a></cite>, rather than physical impairments under either<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c03s72-332" target="_self">§ 72-332 </a></cite>or<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§ 72-406</a></cite>, where the industrial commission found that claimant’s physical appearance and history of excessive alcohol consumption did not hinder him in his earning capacity prior to the accident, where, since he was a teenager claimant had functioned in the manual labor market without suffering any loss of potential earning capacity, and where claimant’s physical appearance and history of excessive alcohol consumption had not served as a hindrance in that job market. Roberts v. Asgrow Seed Co., 116 Idaho 209, 775 P.2d 101 (1989).

        Liability for nonmedical factors should be apportioned between the employer and the industrial special indemnity fund in proportion to their respective percentages of responsibility for the physical impairment. Quincy v. Quincy, 136 Idaho 1, 27 P.3d 410 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because industrial commission found that a workers seizures were due to alcohol withdrawal, it also considered them as a pertinent nonmedical factor; the industrial commission also took into account how those factors would affect the worker’s future ability to work.

        A psychological disorder lacking physical manifestations can be treated as a nonmedical factor under this section, which mandates an appraisal of a claimant’s present and probable future ability to engage in employment, as it is affected by the medical factor of permanent impairment and by pertinent nonmedical factors as provided in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-430" target="_self">§ 72-430</a></cite>.

        Odd-lot Status.

       <p>
        Since the plaintiff did not testify as to the types of lighter duty work that he was able to perform or the availability of such jobs in his geographical area, the record thus supported the commission’s findings that the plaintiff did not meet his burden of establishing odd-lot status in order to establish permanent and total disability. Dehlbom v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 129 Idaho 579, 930 P.2d 1021 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant sought permanent disability under the odd-lot status and there was conflict between testimony of claimant’s vocational counselor that claimant was not capable of performing any job and the testimony of company’s vocational expert that claimant was suitable for several types of jobs, since commission found the testimony of company’s vocational expert to be more credible and persuasive, claimant’s claim was denied and claimant’s argument that company expert’s evaluation should not be persuasive because there are no specific jobs available in the categories for which she found him to be qualified was without merit, for it has never been held that unless a prima facie case of odd-lot disability is established, an employer or ISIF must prove that there is a specific job in existence in order to defeat a claim for total or permanent disability. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
    Where claimant for total disability failed to show that he had attempted other types of employment, that he did little to find work after leaving company, met with his vocational counselor only once, inquired about only a few jobs, and never sought employment in the area, and there was a conflict in the evidence about whether attempts to find employment would have been futile, he failed to establish odd-lot worker status. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee may prove total disability under the odd-lot worker doctrine in one of three ways: 1. by showing that he has attempted other types of employment without success; 2. by showing that he or vocational counselors or employment agencies on his or her behalf have searched for other work and other work is not available; 3. by showing that any efforts to find suitable employment would be futile. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant sought compensation for total and permanent disability under the definition of odd-lot worker and the evidence of claimant’s vocational expert was that claimant was not capable of performing any type of job, but company’s expert was of the opinion that even with claimant’s partial disability there were still jobs he could perform, the questions of whether claimant was an odd-lot worker became a question of fact for the commission to decide. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proving a prima facie case of odd-lot status is on the claimant; however, where a dispute exists as to the extent of disability, the type of work the claimant is capable of performing, and the effort made to find suitable employment, whether the claimant is odd-lot status is a factual determination within the discretion of the commission. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant may establish a prima facie case of odd-lot disability status as a matter of law only if the evidence is undisputed and is reasonably susceptible to only one interpretation. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a claimant demonstrates that he fits within the definition of an odd-lot worker he has proven total and permanent disability. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        An odd lot employee is someone who is so injured that he can perform no services other than those which are so limited in quality, dependability or quantity that a reasonably stable market for them does not exist, such that he may well be classified as totally disabled. Funes v. Aardema Dairy, 150 Idaho 7, 244 P.3d 151 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho industrial commission properly held that the Idaho industrial special indemnity fund was not liable for an employee’s permanent total disability benefits because the employer failed to prove that the employee’s last accident by itself did not render the employee totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot doctrine. Tarbet v. J.R. Simplot Co., 151 Idaho 755, 264 P.3d 394 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the employee was not an odd-lot worker, where she successfully obtained employment after recovering from the accident, she failed to show that she did more than conduct a cursory work search, and the testimony showed that she could have performed sedentary and light duty work. Sevy v. SVL Analytical, Inc., 159 Idaho 579, 364 P.3d 279 (2015).

       <p>
        The primary purpose of an award of permanent partial disability benefits is to compensate the claimant for his loss of earning capacity or his reduced ability to engage in gainful activity. Baldner v. Bennett’s, Inc., 103 Idaho 458, 649 P.2d 1214 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported the industrial commission’s determination that an employee failed to meet her burden of proving disability in excess of impairment resulting from the industrial accident, where the conclusion that she suffered a two percent permanent partial impairment based on a treating physician’s opinion was not definitionally inconsistent with the adoption of an evaluating physician’s opinion that the industrial accident did not result in permanent limitations or restrictions. Sevy v. SVL Analytical, Inc., 159 Idaho 579, 364 P.3d 279 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho industrial commission erred in concluding that a worker’s permanent partial disability (PPD) rating was lower than his partial permanent impairment (PPI) rating; because the impairment is part of the calculation for disability: once a PPI disability rating has been set, a PPD rating cannot be lower than such a rating, and the PPI rating is a permanent rating of impairment.

       <p>
        In a workers’ compensation case, a remand was necessary because there was no clear indication as to a benefit claimant’s permanent disability in light of the accident and her pre-existing conditions since the Idaho industrial commission failed to articulate both steps in making its apportionment after determining that there was a 5 percent permanent disability. The commission was required to evaluate the claimant’s disability according to the factors in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-430" target="_self">§ 72-430</a></cite>(1), make findings as to her permanent disability in light of all of her physical impairments, including pre-existing conditions, and then apportion the amount of the permanent disability attributable to the claimant’s accident.

        When a claimant’s impairment is progressive, the industrial commission may estimate his probable future disability and reduce it to present value for the purpose of making a final award which takes into account probable future changes in impairment.

       <p>
        Even though the claimant’s personality disorder lacked physical manifestations, the industrial commission was correct in including the psychological disorder as a personal circumstance and allocating responsibility between the special indemnity fund and the employer/surety. Mapusaga v. Red Lion Riverside Inn, 113 Idaho 842, 748 P.2d 1372 (1987), overruled on other grounds, Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Idaho industrial commission properly determined an employee’s disability at the time of a hearing, because: the claimant was employable with psychological treatment; under the odd-lot worker ananlysis, no work was sought and found unavailable; and an expert said seeking work was not futile.

        Successive Injuries.
       </h5>
       <p>
        When evaluating a claimant’s ability to find employment in the future, the commission must consider all of his physical impairments, not just the most recent one, since the effect of successive injuries may be greater than the sum of the impairments resulting from each. Lyons v. Industrial Special Indem. Fund, 98 Idaho 403, 565 P.2d 1360 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the commission, in evaluating the disability of a claimant who suffered successive injuries, apparently concluded that since the most recent injury was not in itself totally disabling and since the previous injuries had not been disabling in the past, the claimant was not totally and permanently disabled, the commission’s approach did not adequately consider the effect of nonmedical factors, such as the claimant’s lack of an education or special training or skills, which had not prevented the claimant from working when he was able to do heavy manual labor but would undoubtedly lessen his chances of finding employment in the future since he could no longer perform such labor. Lyons v. Industrial Special Indem. Fund, 98 Idaho 403, 565 P.2d 1360 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported industrial commission’s finding that although claimant was found to have a permanent disability of 30% of the whole person after his second injury, because most of his limitations existed prior to the second injury, the portion of claimant’s disability resulting from the second injury did not exceed the portion of the physical impairment rating of five percent attributable to that injury; the remainder of claimant’s disability rating accrued prior to the 1989 injury, thus insurer was not liable for that portion.

       <p>
        If the evidence of medical and nonmedical factors before the commission prima facie places them in the “odd-lot” category, the burden is then on the employer to show that some kind of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant that there is an actual job within a reasonable distance from appellant’s home which he is able to perform or for which he can be trained and that the injured worker has a reasonable opportunity to be employed at that job. Reifsteck v. Lantern Motel & Cafe, 101 Idaho 699, 619 P.2d 1152 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff’s injury to his neck, which occurred while loading timber onto a truck, resulted in a disability of 15 percent of the whole man, a finding supported by both competent medical and nonmedical evidence, he was not entitled to benefits for a total disability simply because he could not perform adequately in his previous job as a truck driver, since he had not shown there was no suitable occupation open to him. Gordon v. West, 103 Idaho 100, 645 P.2d 334 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony that claimant had been performing the duties of cooking and meal planning for residents of “retirement home” run in claimant’s home supported the conclusion that claimant had not only attempted other employment, but had successfully performed other work, and, therefore, there was substantial and competent evidence to support the commission’s conclusion that claimant failed to establish a prima facie case that he fell within the odd-lot category. Rost v. J.R. Simplot Co., 106 Idaho 444, 680 P.2d 866 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant must do more than assert that he cannot perform his previous type of employment in order to qualify as an “odd-lot” worker; he must show what other types of employment he has attempted. The commission, as the factfinder, must consider whether the claimant has tried and could not perform other work. Carey v. Clearwater County Rd. Dep’t, 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984).
    If the evidence of the medical and nonmedical factors places a claimant prima facie in the odd-lot category the burden is then on the employer, the special indemnity fund, to show that some kind of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant. In meeting its burden, it will not be sufficient for the fund to merely show that the claimant is able to perform some type of work; it is necessary that the fund introduce evidence that there is an actual job within a reasonable distance from claimant’s home which he is able to perform or for which he can be trained. In addition, the fund must show that the claimant has a reasonable opportunity to be employed at that job. Carey v. Clearwater County Rd. Dep’t, 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial commission did not err in holding that the claimant satisfied his burden of showing a prima facie case of being an “odd-lot” worker where the evidence showed that the claimant had inquired into work and that his further efforts would have been futile in view of the lack of sedentary work available, claimant’s inability to travel, claimant’s lack of qualifications for any sedentary work that was available, and claimant’s inability to work regularly and steadily due to his unreliable physical condition.

        The test for determining whether a claimant has suffered a permanent disability greater than permanent impairment is “whether the physical impairment, taken in conjunction with nonmedical factors, has reduced the claimant’s capacity for gainful activity.” Graybill v.

       <p>
        A claimant’s impairment evaluation or rating is one component or element to be considered by the commission in determining a claimant’s permanent partial disability, and is not the exclusive factor determinative of the disability rating fixed by the commission. A disability rating may exceed the claimant’s impairment rating. Baldner v. Bennett’s, Inc., 103 Idaho 458, 649 P.2d 1214 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission did not apply the standard set forth in this section in determining that claimant was not entitled to a disability award greater than his medical impairment rating, where there was no indication that the commission examined his ability to engage in gainful activity as it was affected by nonmedical factors, such as the fact that he was 43 years of age with no formal education or ability to read or write; that he could no longer engage in construction or farm work and that his ability to drive trucks was diminished by his accident. Bennett v. Clark Hereford Ranch, 106 Idaho 438, 680 P.2d 539 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that claimant was able to continue truck driving in spite of injury did not establish that his ability to engage in gainful activity was not diminished by the nonmedical factors the commission is required to consider under this section. Bennett v. Clark Hereford Ranch, 106 Idaho 438, 680 P.2d 539 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disability must include medical impairment, but medical impairment will not always be the same as disability. Fenich v. Boise Elks Lodge No. 310, 106 Idaho 550, 682 P.2d 91 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this section required that nonmedical factors be considered in arriving at a permanent disability rating, and since the referee’s finding of fact stated that nonmedical factors were not considered, it was clear that the award provided by the compensation agreement was based only upon a permanent impairment rating; however, that fact alone does not necessarily indicate that the award was for permanent impairment only. Whether the award was for permanent impairment or permanent disability is dependent on the actual agreement of the parties. Woodvine v. Triangle Dairy, Inc., 106 Idaho 716, 682 P.2d 1263 (1984).

        Section 72-419 is used to calculate the rate at which income benefits are paid, which is better suited to mathematical calculation, but when evaluating a claimant’s permanent physical disability, the industrial commission is required to consider the factors articulated in this section and cannot rely solely upon mathematical calculation.

        A claimant’s impairment evaluation or rating is one component or element to be considered by the commission in determining a claimant’s permanent partial disability and is not the exclusive factor determinative of the disability rating fixed by the commission.

        Where the evidence showed that the claimant, following his impairment and removal from the labor market as an ironworker due to a back injury, had educated and continued to educate himself for the purpose of teaching welding at a state university, and that the defendant employer had failed to establish that the claimant could earn more than he was earning in that teaching position, the commission properly found that the claimant’s 44% decrease in his wage-earning capacity from what he earned as an ironworker to what he earned as a teacher fully supported its award of a permanent partial disability equal to 44% of a whole man as a result of the back injury, even though the claimant’s permanent physical impairment rating was only equivalent to 15% of the whole man.

        Commission’s determination of the degree of loss of vision to claimant’s left eye, because of the loss of the natural lens as permanent partial impairment of fifty percent of the left eye even though an artificial lens was implanted in place of the natural lens, was not contrary to
    Kelly v. Prouty
    , 54 Idaho 225, 30 P.2d 769 (1934) holding that in determining the specific indemnity for loss of vision corrective glasses and other artificial means should not be considered. Burke v. EG & G/Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co., 126 Idaho 413, 885 P.2d 372 (1994).

       <p>
        Where claimant because of being struck in the eye by a metal fragment had to have his natural lens removed and an artificial lens implanted, evidence submitted on the question of possible complications that claimant might experience as a result of the artificial lens was speculative and highly unlikely, and thus commission’s finding that claimant would not suffer from progressive impairment or serious complications because of his condition was not in error.

       <p>
        Once a claimant’s condition is stabilized and his disability is rated, his benefits are calculated differently: If the disability is total, it is still computed by the “currently applicable average weekly state wage” of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-408" target="_self">§ 72-408</a></cite>(1) or (2), but if it is a partial permanent disability, it is calculated under this section, which makes no reference to the “currently applicable” average weekly state wage of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-408" target="_self">§ 72-408</a></cite>(1) and (2). Hence, the legislature intended benefits for partial permanent disability to be fixed and quantifiable. Partial permanent disability benefits are not, nor are they intended to be, whole-life benefits. Carey v. Clearwater County Rd. Dep’t, 107 Idaho 109, 686 P.2d 54 (1984).

        In awarding claimant permanent partial impairment of fifty percent of the left eye where because of being hit in the left eye by a metal fragment surgical removal of the claimant’s natural lens and the implanting of an artificial lens was required, commission’s consideration of such nonmedical factors as claimant’s educational background, his vocational training, his employment after the injury, and the status of the economy and the construction industry in the locale of his residence in determining the degree of permanent disability was proper, and evidence supported the finding that the nonmedical factors did not increase claimant’s permanent partial disability and that such disability did not exceed his permanent physical impairment rating.

        Where both physicians testified that the claimant’s condition was progressive, the industrial commission could not assess the claimant’s permanent partial disability based solely upon his present level of impairment and erroneously relinquished jurisdiction over the future determination of the claimant’s permanent disability.

        In a situation where the claimant’s impairment is progressive and, therefore, cannot adequately be determined for purposes of establishing a permanent disability rating, it is entirely appropriate for the industrial commission to retain jurisdiction until such time as the claimant’s condition is nonprogressive.

        In action seeking increase in award for permanent disability of his eye in which his natural lens was removed and an artificial lens was implanted due to claimant being struck in the eye by a metal fragment, the commission applied the correct legal standard in declining to retain jurisdiction where claimant’s impairment was nonprogressive and could be determined for establishing a permanent disability rating.

        The use of corrective glasses, in the event of the loss of an eye, or other artificial means, should not, or might not be permitted to be taken into consideration in fixing specific indemnities, and in determining those specific indemnities the loss of earning power or capacity to work was not to be considered. Kelley v. Prouty, 54 Idaho 225, 30 P.2d 769 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employee lost an eye, there would not be deducted from the award therefor the amount paid to him because of his partial loss of vision, due to a former accident, on the theory that he did not suffer total loss of his eye in the accident which befell him for which he claimed compensation. The employee was entitled to the specific indemnity for loss of his eye by enucleation, even though the vision was impaired. Leach v. Grangeville Hwy. Dist., 55 Idaho 307, 41 P.2d 618 (1935).

        An award of specific indemnity was grounded upon rating of partial permanent disability and monetary value of such rating; since both stemmed from the covered injury and could not be separated, if one aspect fell by reason of being incorrect, then the other must have fallen. Hix v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 88 Idaho 155, 397 P.2d 237 (1964).
    In determining specific indemnities payable for permanent injuries, disability for work, loss of earning power, or capacity to work were not factors to be considered. Hix v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 88 Idaho 155, 397 P.2d 237 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The degree of claimant’s partial permanent disability, residual of his permanent injury, must have been evaluated in terms of specific indemnity payable as for loss or comparative loss of bodily members, where medical evidence showed that claimant was surgically healed and able to return to light work, although suffering a partial permanent disability, residual of his covered injury.

        It was intention of the legislature to grant the indemnity for each specific injury in the law enumerated and comparable indemnities for other cases not enumerated in the statute, and each indemnity was intended to be separate and independent from every other indemnity.

        The legislature must have intended, in fixing the schedule of indemnities, to take into consideration, in some measure, all of the elements, along with loss of earning power, including pain and suffering, going to make up the loss to a workman who lost a member of his body, in the course of his employment.

        It was the major purpose and the general spirit and tenor of the provisions of the workmen’s compensation law, except where it provided for specific indemnities, that compensation was provided to make good for the loss or impairment of earning power resulting from injury and requiring industry to bear a burden which otherwise might have been cast upon the worker and his family.

        Where an employee had a leg injury, for which he was paid compensation, and as a result of such injury, an amputation was thereafter necessary, and while the latter event was the result of accident and injury, compensation paid before amputation would not be taken into consideration in determining the indemnity for the loss of the leg.

       <p>
        In its order denying the claimant’s request to set aside the lump sum agreement, the industrial commission specifically mentioned claimant’s age, level of education, and the working environment to which he had become accustomed; such references by the commission clearly indicated that it was aware of those nonmedical factors affecting claimant’s ability to compete in an open labor market.

        Where the industrial commission found that claimant’s later employment by department of parks was essentially the equivalent of work provided by a sympathetic employer or friend and this conclusion was supported by the record, the finding that claimant was odd-lot totally permanently disabled prior to her most recent injury and the total permanent disability did not result from combined effects was affirmed.

        If the “personal and economic circumstances of the employee” at the time of the hearing do not reflect a compensable need, then the spirit of the workers’ compensation law would not be served by awarding disability based on an antecedent, but no longer existing, need; granted, there may be instances where a market other than the claimant’s residence at the time of the hearing is relevant to the inquiry, and such determinations should be made on a case by case basis based in individual facts and circumstances.

        In evaluating permanent disability under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-425" target="_self">§ 72-425 </a></cite>and this section, all physical impairments that were caused by the work-related injury and by all pre-existing impairments or physical conditions should be taken into account; otherwise, there would be no determination of disability that would permit an apportionment for pre-existing impairments under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§§ 72-406 </a></cite>and 72-332.

       <p>
        Where worker, after work-related accident which affected his right hip, had a later injury to his left hip, shoulders, and back due to arthritis and spondylolisthesis, commission should have included the impairments to worker’s left hip, his shoulders, and his back in making its evaluation of the degree of his total and permanent disability since the conditions that caused these impairments existed at the time of the injury to worker’s right hip; whether any of these impairments led to liability of employer and its surety or the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) depended on apportionment under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-406" target="_self">§§ 72-406 </a></cite>and 72-332.

       </p>
       <p>
        As the industrial commission correctly opined, the fact that claimant settled for a disability award based on twenty percent of the whole man, which is equal to his permanent impairment rating, did not indicate that he has been treated unfairly; whether a claimant has suffered a permanent disability greater than permanent physical impairment is determined by assessing whether the physical impairment, taken in conjunction with non-medical factors, has reduced the claimant’s capacity for gainful activity; the commission noted that at the time of the hearing in December 1988, claimant was employed at a higher hourly wage than he received in the same position prior to the 1985 accidental injury, and therefore did not have a reduced capacity to engage in gainful activity. Matthews v. Department of Cors., 121 Idaho 680, 827 P.2d 693 (1992).
    Where claimant was struck in the left eye by a metal fragment which necessitated the removal of his natural lens and the implant of an artificial lens, the fact that the long-term medical effects of such lens are unknown, that there are medical risks and potential complications which arise from such lens implantation, that claimant experienced glare caused by the lens and experienced headaches, eye fatigue and more problems with debris in this eye than before the implant and had to wear bifocals to focus on close objects because his left eye would only focus at a distance, are medical in nature and relate to the degree of permanent impairment and not to the degree of permanent disability, and thus cannot be considered to increase his permanent disability. Burke v. EG & G/Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co., 126 Idaho 413, 885 P.2d 372 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported a permanent partial disability rating: the industrial commission properly considered the claimant’s limited language skills, the labor market, and his chronic pain in determining his percentage of impairment and found that he was not an odd lot worker. Funes v. Aardema Dairy, 150 Idaho 7, 244 P.3d 151 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho industrial commission erred in concluding that a worker’s permanent partial disability (PPD) rating was lower than his partial permanent impairment (PPI) rating; because the impairment is part of the calculation for disability: once a PPI disability rating has been set, a PPD rating cannot be lower than such a rating, and the PPI rating is a permanent rating of impairment.

        The industrial commission concluded that although the employee did suffer a 1% impairment due to sensory loss, this impairment did not decrease his wage-earning capacity because he was able to work without restriction in his regular occupations; therefore, he did not suffer any disability in excess of his impairment, and the pertinent nonmedical factors of this section, such as the employee’s limited education and his inability to speak or understand English, never became relevant.

        Claim that the industrial commission should have considered wage increases implemented by claimant’s former employer during the interim between his injury and subsequent employment with another employer was unsupported by law and too speculative as it could not be ascertained whether claimant would have continued working for former employer, or whether he would have received the same raises that current employees received. McClurg v. Yanke Mach. Shop, Inc., 123 Idaho 174, 845 P.2d 1207 (1993).

        Probable future wage increases are speculative and unsupported by law unless the claimant is performing the act being used as the test pre-injury and post-injury; thus, where claimant’s employment activity changed after he was injured, any future wage increases that he may have received had he remained in his pre-injury employment activity were unascertainable and irrelevant.

        Where claimant sought permanent disability under the odd-lot status and there was conflict between testimony of claimant’s vocational counselor that claimant was not capable of performing any job and the testimony of company’s vocational expert that claimant was suitable for several types of jobs, since commission found the testimony of company’s vocational expert to be more credible and persuasive, claimant’s claim was denied and claimant’s argument that company expert’s evaluation should not be persuasive because there are no specific jobs available in the categories for which she found him to be qualified was without merit, for it has never been held that unless a prima facie case of odd-lot disability is established, an employer or ISIF must prove that there is a specific job in existence in order to defeat a claim for total or permanent disability.

        Where claimant for total disability failed to show that he had attempted other types of employment, that he did little to find work after leaving company, met with his vocational counselor only once, inquired about only a few jobs, and never sought employment in the area, and there was a conflict in the evidence about whether attempts to find employment would have been futile, he failed to establish odd-lot worker status. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee may prove total disability under the odd-lot worker doctrine in one of three ways: 1. by showing that he has attempted other types of employment without success; 2. by showing that he or vocational counselors or employment agencies on his or her behalf have searched for other work and other work is not available; 3. by showing that any efforts to find suitable employment would be futile. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proving a prima facie case of odd-lot status is on the claimant; however, where a dispute exists as to the extent of disability, the type of work the claimant is capable of performing, and the effort made to find suitable employment, whether the claimant is odd-lot status is a factual determination within the discretion of the commission. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997).

        Although medical panels did not specifically designate a portion of the impairment rating as based solely on pain, the reports of both panels clearly took into account claimant’s past complaints of pain; thus, there was competent evidence supporting the industrial commission’s finding that pain was a component of the impairment rating.

        Where the evidence showed that the claimant suffered a heart attack during the course of his employment, but the only evidence presented to the industrial commission in support of its determination that the claimant suffered a permanent partial impairment of 50 percent of the whole person failed to consider a preexisting heart condition, such determination was not supported by the evidence. Johnson v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 108 Idaho 765, 702 P.2d 803 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported industrial commission’s finding that although claimant was found to have a permanent disability of 30% of the whole person after his second injury, because most of his limitations existed prior to the second injury, the portion of claimant’s disability resulting from the second injury did not exceed the portion of the physical impairment rating of five percent attributable to that injury; the remainder of claimant’s disability rating accrued prior to the 1989 injury, thus insurer was not liable for that portion.

        In a workers’ compensation case, a remand was necessary because there was no clear indication as to a benefit claimant’s permanent disability in light of the accident and her pre-existing conditions since the Idaho industrial commission failed to articulate both steps in making its apportionment after determining that there was a 5 percent permanent disability. The commission was required to evaluate the claimant’s disability according to the factors in subsection (1) of this section, make findings as to her permanent disability in light of all of her physical impairments, including pre-existing conditions, and then apportion the amount of the permanent disability attributable to the claimant’s accident.

        The literal wording, the general rules of statutory interpretation, prior case law, and the underlying purpose of this section, all suggest that, under subsection (1) of this section, the industrial commission should consider the market in which a claimant resides at the time of the hearing as the axis from which the scope of a “reasonable geographic area” is defined.

        Where the plaintiff’s injury to his neck, which occurred while loading timber onto a truck, resulted in a disability of 15 percent of the whole man, a finding supported by both competent medical and nonmedical evidence, he was not entitled to benefits for a total disability simply because he could not perform adequately in his previous job as a truck driver, since he had not shown there was no suitable occupation open to him.

        As to scheduled relief, the award became liquidated damages in a final definite amount. It inured to the employee and not to his dependents. It was not compensation for disability, which otherwise might have ceased with his death. The right thereto, though not determined, became fixed at the time of the accident. An award was properly recoverable by the deceased workman’s representative. Such claim was not in any sense a death claim. Mahoney v. Payette, 64 Idaho 443, 133 P.2d 927 (1943).

        The industrial commission found that claimant was not entitled to payment, pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, because no evidence indicated that the bills were directly incurred as a result of his 1985 back injury; the commission correctly concluded that claimant failed to carry his burden of establishing that the medical bills arose as a result of his initial back injury in 1985 and that claimant failed to meet his burden of establishing that any expenses for prescription medication were incurred due to his 1985 industrial accident.

        Issue at the employee’s second workers’ compensation hearing was whether her need for neck surgery was caused by her industrial accident. The reasonableness of such medical care was not at issue and the workers’ compensation commission did not err in requiring that she prove a causal connection between her industrial accident and the need for her neck surgery.

        The Idaho industrial commission did not err by rejecting the unrebutted testimony of an expert with respect to causation, because a claimant chose not to provide his expert with medical records of two accidents that occurred after his industrial accident and that injured the same parts of his body. The claimant had the burden of proving that symptoms occurring were caused by the industrial accident. Waters v. All Phase Constr., 156 Idaho 259, 322 P.3d 992 (2014).

        Amendments to subsection (4) achieve the following: (1) require written notice to an employer or surety prior to petitioning the Idaho industrial commission for a change of physician; (2) provide for an expedited hearing and decision; and (3) direct the commission to promulgate rules for handling of petitions; to the extent that case law stands for the proposition that subsection (4) does not require written notice, the 1997 amendment to the statute supersedes it.

        Employee’s written claim for benefits was a “claim” for the purposes of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-706" target="_self">§ 72-706</a></cite>(1); while the claim was filed prior to the employee’s visits to a new physician, the surety became aware of the new physician’s involvement through correspondence prior to the hearing, and this knowledge, combined with the claim, gave the employer and surety time to pay for the treatment, and thus the employee effectively petitioned the Idaho industrial commission for a change of physician pursuant to subsection (4). Seward v. Pac. Hide &amp; Fur Depot, 138 Idaho 509, 65 P.3d 531 (2003).
    Industrial commission erred in holding that claimant, who sought medical benefits for a second surgery, was required to seek permission for a change of physician once his employer wrongfully ceased providing medical care as required by subsection (1); the second surgery was reasonably required and was needed as a consequence of claimant’s work-related injury.

        Order of the industrial commission, requiring an employer and its surety to pay the cost of a guardian and a conservator for a claimant, who suffered a severe, traumatic brain injury as a result of an industrial accident, which left him unable to care for himself, was affirmed, as the services of a guardian and a conservator constitute “other attendance” under subsection (1) and are the responsibility of the employer and its surety.

Mulder v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Co., 135 Idaho 52, 14 P.3d 372 (2000).

        Industrial commission properly found that air transport for an injured employee’s injury was reasonable medical treatment because, while the air transport might be seen as arguably unnecessary with the benefit of hindsight, there was substantial and competent evidence that the employee’s air transport was reasonable medical treatment where medical personnel made the determination that it was possible to reattach the tip of the employee’s finger and that taking him to a hospital was his best chance of success for the procedure. Chavez v. Stokes, 158 Idaho 793, 353 P.3d 414 (2015).

        In a workers’ compensation context, the word “treatment” is a broad term and is employed to indicate all steps taken in order to effect a cure of an injury or disease. Thus, palliative, pain-killing treatments can be compensable even though they will not necessarily cure an employee’s condition and even if the pain management treatment consists of prescribed pain medication that results in addiction or dependency, which, in turn, requires additional treatment. Rish v. Home Depot, Inc., 161 Idaho 702, 390 P.3d 428 (2017).

        An injured employee is entitled to such medical, surgical, or other treatment as may be reasonably required to relieve him from the effects of his injury and arrest and stay further damage which would naturally flow from the injury. Requiring an injured worker to endure pain resulting from an industrial accident without assistance of analgesic medications is scarcely consistent with the “humane purposes” for which Idaho’s worker’s compensation laws were promulgated. Rish v. Home Depot, Inc., 161 Idaho 702, 390 P.3d 428 (2017).

        Where throughout proceedings before the commission the employer had continually denied all medical and hospital expenses incurred in the treatment of claimant and refused to pay them, following the commission’s order requiring employer to pay all such expenses, no further action or notice on behalf of claimant was necessary to obtain reimbursement for any allowable expenses reasonably related to the injury.

        Where claimant had submitted to repeated examinations but prior to 1960 no one knew for certain the cause of his distress and symptoms and where two days after submitting to a myelogram by which his condition was correctly diagnosed the laminectomy was performed relieving claimant’s condition, such surgery was not unreasonably belated although the injury had occurred more than five years previously in view of the fact that his physician and consultants and examining specialists previously consulted had not found sufficient evidence to make a like diagnosis.

       </p>
       <p>
        “Reasonable time” was not necessarily limited to the period of specific indemnity payments and it was not error for the board to order payment of medical expenses up to the date of the hearing and to hold in abeyance for subsequent determination the matter of responsibility for any further medical expense that might subsequently have been necessary.

       After an injury or contraction of an occupational disease and during the period of disability the employee, if requested by the employer or ordered by the commission, shall submit himself for examination at reasonable times and places to a duly qualified physician or surgeon. The employee shall be reimbursed for his expenses of necessary travel and subsistence in submitting himself for any such examination and for loss of wages, if any. For purposes of this section, the reimbursement for loss of wages shall be at the employee’s then current rate of pay if the employee is then working; otherwise, such reimbursement shall be at the total temporary disability rate. Reimbursement for travel expenses, if the employee utilizes a private vehicle, shall be at the mileage rate allowed by the state board of examiners for state employees; provided, however, that the employee shall not be reimbursed for the first fifteen (15) miles of any round trip, nor for traveling any round trip distance of fifteen (15) miles or less. Such distance shall be calculated by the shortest practical route of travel.

       The employee shall have the right to have a physician or surgeon designated and paid by himself present at an examination by a physician or surgeon so designated by the employer. Such right, however, shall not be construed to deny the employer’s designated physician or surgeon the right to visit the injured employee during reasonable times and under all reasonable conditions during disability. The employee and the examining physician shall have the right to have an audio recording of any examination, but may have a video recording only if the examining physician and the employee consent.

       At any time after injury, if an injured employee be sent to a facility approved by the commission for physical or vocational rehabilitation, the employee shall be furnished by the employer reasonable travel accommodations to and from such facility and if the injured employee is an outpatient in a physical rehabilitation facility, he shall be paid daily subsistence as the commission may authorize to cover reasonable expenses of board, lodging and transportation. Reimbursement for transportation expense, if the employee utilizes a private vehicle, shall be at the mileage rate allowed by the state board of examiners for state employees; provided however, that the employee shall not be reimbursed for the first fifteen (15) miles of any round trip, nor for traveling any round trip distance of fifteen (15) miles or less.

        The legislative intent of this section is to protect an employee compelled to undergo medical examination by physicians whom he or she did not select against potential intrusive questions and techniques. Since physicians are obviously more versed in the techniques of medical examinations, the Idaho legislature intended to ensure that a claimant concerned about a compulsory second exam scheduled by the surety and conducted by a physician not of the employee’s choosing would be able to protect against unwarranted examination questions or techniques.

        This section does not contain any express enumeration of persons who can or can not attend a medical evaluation or exam. The statute simply guarantees the right of an employee to attend a compelled medical examination with a physician of his or her choice. The fact that the statute allows the employee’s physician to be present does not automatically or necessarily exclude all others. The plain language of the statute does not suggest that all others are excluded but rather only that a claimant’s physician may be present. Hewson v.

        As a matter of law, a workers’ compensation claimant unreasonably refused to cooperate with a medical examination when the claimant refused to complete an intake form or any of the paperwork requested by a physician attempting to perform an independent medical exam.

        Industrial commission erred in concluding that an employee’s injuries — sustained in an automobile accident when returning home from an independent medical evaluation (IME) scheduled by the surety in connection with an earlier industrial accident — were not compensable, because the IME was employer-requested, with a doctor chosen by employer, at a time and place chosen by employer, solely for employer’s benefit, and failure to attend the IME would have resulted in suspension of the employee’s right to benefits.

        Evidence supported board’s findings that claimant was unreasonable in his refusal to submit to conservative diagnostic treatment for two weeks when tendered by former employer, such treatment to include neither a myelogram nor surgery, such diagnostic treatment being recommended in order that the nature of claimant’s back injury or affliction be accurately determined, regardless of claimant’s contention that he should not be required to submit to such diagnostic treatment unless compensation payments were resumed from the date of original suspension caused by his refusal to accept medical treatment up through the time of the diagnostic treatment.

        Where the death of an employee results from an occupational disease, recovery may be had only because of the onslaught of such disease, and not by reason of an accidental injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning was an occupational disease, and, therefore, recovery may not have been sustained as for an accidental injury.

        Occupational Disease Defined and Distinguished.
       </h5>
       <p>
        An occupational disease had its origin in the inherent nature or mode of work of the profession or industry and it was the usual result or concomitant, not the result of some extrinsic or independent agency. Ramsay v. Sullivan Mining Co., 51 Idaho 366, 6 P.2d 856 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        An occupational or industrial disease was one which arose from causes incident to the profession or labor of the party’s occupation or calling. If, therefore, a disease was not a customary or natural result of the profession or industry, per se, but was the consequence of some extrinsic condition or independent agency, the disease or injury could not be imputed to the occupation or industry, and was in no accurate sense an occupational or industrial disease. Crowley v. Idaho Indus. Training Sch., 53 Idaho 606, 26 P.2d 180 (1933) (But see Goaslind v. Pocatello, 61 Idaho 435, 102 P.2d 650 (1940)).
       </p>
       <p>
        The distinction between a condition amounting to an occupational disease, within the meaning of the occupational disease act, and an accidental disease, compensable under the compensation act, was the suddenness of the onslaught. Dobbs v. Bureau of Hwys., 63 Idaho 290, 120 P.2d 263 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to warrant recovery under the provisions of this act, the disease complained of had to be peculiar to a given occupation or brought about by condition to which all workmen in the occupation are constantly exposed. Morgan v. Simplot, 66 Idaho 584, 155 P.2d 917 (1945).

        Neither pleurisy nor tuberculosis was an occupational disease. Flasche v. Bunker Hill Co., 83 Idaho 420, 363 P.2d 1024 (1961); Stockdale v. Sunshine Mining Co., 84 Idaho 506, 373 P.2d 935 (1962). Silicosis.
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim may have been allowed when the accident was due to repetitious cumulative causes, preventable by employer. Beaver v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 55 Idaho 275, 41 P.2d 605 (1934); Brown v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 49, 87 P.2d 1000 (1938); Nixon v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 64, 87 P.2d 1007 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute clearly recognized two classes of silicosis: (a) “disability” silicosis and (b) “nondisabling silicosis.” The disease of either class, as recognized by the statute, however, was silicosis, whether it was disabling or nondisabling. It was clearly the intention of the legislature that liability for such condition should not be imposed by law upon the last employer until he had exposed the employee to at least sixty days’ hazard of “dust of silicon dioxide (SiO
    ).” Habera v. Polaris Mining Co., 62 Idaho 54, 108 P.2d 297 (1940).
       </p>
       <sup>

       </sup>
       <p>
        Where a mining company employed a workman with the understanding he could remain in its employment only if he passed a successful “pre-employment examination” and the examination given twenty days later disclosed that the workman was rejected because of nondisabling silicosis, the workman could not recover compensation under the occupational disease compensation law from the company, since an employee suffering from silicosis, whether disabling or nondisabling, must have been exposed to the germs of the disease during the period of sixty days or more in the employment of the employer to be entitled to compensation under this law. Habera v. Polaris Mining Co., 62 Idaho 54, 108 P.2d 297 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Between antipodes of silicosis as an occupational disease and its accidental contraction there was a zone wherein, depending on the particular circumstances of the case and accidental features, or the absence thereof, affliction from silicosis would or would not justify compensation. Howard v. Texas Owyhee Mining & Dev. Co., 62 Idaho 707, 115 P.2d 749 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Combined silicosis and tuberculosis, causing the total disability of the employee, after being employed in the dust of a rock crusher for two years, sustained an award for compensation for accidental pulmonary tuberculosis brought on by silica dust. Dobbs v. Bureau of Hwys., 63 Idaho 290, 120 P.2d 263 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though the compensation claimant, in the first instance, contended that his total disability was caused by silicosis, it was incumbent on the board to determine whether the claimant was afflicted with disabling or nondisabling silicosis within this act, or accidental tuberculosis within the compensation act, and enter an order accordingly. Dobbs v. Bureau of Hwys., 63 Idaho 290, 120 P.2d 263 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disease not contracted or aggravated in last employment, compensation denied. Benson v. Jarvis, 64 Idaho 107, 127 P.2d 784 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff was injuriously exposed to the inhalation of silica dust of quantity and quality sufficient to cause the silicotic condition, finding and conclusion of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] that plaintiff, at most, had suffered partial disability due to silicosis, which was not compensable, was sufficiently sustained and justified by the evidence, and would not be disturbed on appeal. Carlson v. Small Leasing Co., 71 Idaho 35, 225 P.2d 469 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Silicosis was not compensable as an accident, where evidence showed disease was not due to a sudden onslaught, but was due to a gradual exposure over a period of years. Shumaker v. Hunter Lease & Gold Hunter Mines, 72 Idaho 173, 238 P.2d 425 (1951).
    Claimant could not recover for disability from tuberculosis on the basis of an occupational disease if silicosis was not present, since tuberculosis was not an occupational disease. Davis v. Sunshine Mining Co., 73 Idaho 94, 245 P.2d 822 (1952).

        The legislature’s imposition of a 60-day time requirement in this section before providing compensation for diseases which take a considerable period of time to develop bears a reasonable relation to the goal of fairness to the employer and also lessens the burden on the compensation system; thus, this section does not violate either the equal protection clause or the due process clause of either the United States or Idaho Constitutions.

        Where a claimant contracted dermatitis, which typically is first manifested as a minor irritation and frequently occurs in less than 60 days after exposure to the irritant, the commission erred in requiring the claimant to prove that he had been exposed to the hazards of the disease for 60 days prior to the first manifestation thereof since nothing in this section requires that the 60-day exposure be prior to the first manifestation.

        The occupational disease compensation statute was a departure from the original compensation law and was intended to include certain occupational diseases in the list of compensable accidents not theretofore covered. In attempting to do so, the legislature evidently anticipated difficulty in the application and administration of such an act unless very definite bounds were fixed within which it might operate. It accordingly prescribed certain limitations and prohibitions. Habera v. Polaris Mining Co., 62 Idaho 54, 108 P.2d 297 (1940).

       <p>
        When the first manifestation of an occupational disease occurs prior to the employee leaving his employment and the employee has already given his notice to his employer, there is no need for him to file a second notice within five months after quitting, since one notice is sufficient under subsection (1).

    Where the industrial commission found that immediately following the first diagnosis of hearing loss, the claimant orally submitted that information to the employer, which 12 days later denied any compensation benefits to the claimant, the commission in effect found that the employer had actual notice and specifically held that the employer was not prejudiced by lack of a written notice; therefore, since the record contained no evidence contrary to those findings and holding, the ruling of the commission relating to oral notice was affirmed.

        For purposes of the notice and filing requirements of this section, a disease is not manifest until its cause has been clearly identified by competent medical authority as related to the employee’s work and that information has been communicated to the employee, and such a holding does not change the standard of proof in workers’ compensation cases from one of reasonable medical certainty to one of proof, as such a standard relates only to the notice and filing requirements of this section; once a claim is properly before the commission, the claimant will still be required to prove to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that he or she is suffering from a compensable disease.

       <p>
        Upon the filing of a claim for compensation for death from an occupational disease when an autopsy is necessary accurately and scientifically to ascertain and determine the cause of death, the autopsy shall be ordered by the commission. The commission may designate a duly licensed physician, who is a specialist in such examination, to perform or attend the autopsy and to certify his findings thereon. Such findings shall be filed with the commission and shall be a public record. The commission also may exercise such authority on its own motion or on application made to it at any time by any party in interest, in regard to the cause of death or the existence of any occupational disease. All proceedings for compensation shall be suspended upon refusal of a claimant or claimants to permit such autopsy when so ordered, and no compensation shall be payable during the continuance of such refusal.

      Following a hearing upon a motion of the employer, the employee, or the commission, if the commission deems a permanently disabled employee, after the period of recovery, is receptive to and in need of retraining in another field, skill or vocation in order to restore his earning capacity, the commission may authorize or order such retraining and during the period of retraining or any extension thereof, the employer shall continue to pay the disabled employee, as a subsistence benefit, temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits as the case may be. The period of retraining shall be fixed by the commission but shall not exceed fifty-two (52) weeks unless the commission, following application and hearing, deems it advisable to extend the period of retraining, in which case the increased period shall not exceed fifty-two (52) weeks.

        Idaho industrial commission’s decision to deny a worker’s request for retraining benefits was supported by substantial evidence, because, as the worker intended to continue his education after high school before his accident, nothing showed that “but for” the accident he would have chosen a different path; the worker’s one plus-day’s experience with the employer did not imbue him with skills, was not his chosen field, and was never considered to be a place he intended to pursue his vocation.

        Finding that the employee did not suffer a compensable psychological injury was proper where employee failed to demonstrate that the industrial accident was the predominant cause of his PTSD and symptoms, particularly in light of his prior medical history and his post-incident recovery, including a history of psychiatric disorders.

        The board was an administrative body exercising special judicial functions. Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho 264, 220 P. 1088 (1923), overruled on other grounds, University of Utah Hosp. ex rel.

       </p>
       <p>
        The board was fundamentally a fact finding body. Its application of the law was incidental to its administrative function. It applied the law to the facts as found by it, not to facts found by some other officer or agency. In re Markham’s, Inc., 79 Idaho 307, 316 P.2d 553 (1957).

        Claimant could not appeal referee’s denial of his request to reopen his workers’ compensation case because the industrial commission did not approve and confirm the denial; order was not appealable because it was not an order of the commission, but only of the referee. Section 72-718 provides a procedure by which a party may seek a ruling by the commission on a matter decided by a referee that was not confirmed or approved by the commission in its approval, confirmation, and adoption of the referee’s findings and conclusions.

        Although the industrial commission has the power to adopt a rule which would permit a class action proceeding before it, it has not chosen to adopt such a rule and this inaction does not constitute a denial of due process; accordingly, commission’s order stating that it did not have authority to entertain class action was affirmed.

        As a creature of legislative invention, the commission may only act pursuant to an enumerated power, whether it be directly statutory or based upon rules and regulations properly issued by the commission under this section. Curr v. Curr, 124 Idaho 686, 864 P.2d 132 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In acting beyond the bounds of its statutory authority by sua sponte modifying appellants’ uncontested attorney fee agreements the commission has acted arbitrarily and capriciously and has manifestly abused its discretion. These abuses have bred discomfort and uncertainty in appellants and other attorneys. Without clear guidelines nestled in appropriately promulgated regulations, attorneys’ actions are plagued by doubt, which may have a chilling effect on the underlying purpose of the workers’ compensation act that the commission is constrained to promote under this section. Curr v. Curr, 124 Idaho 686, 864 P.2d 132 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In sua sponte reducing appellants’ uncontested attorney fee agreements without suitable advance notice to all of the parties directly involved, accomplished through properly enacted regulations, and without a meaningful hearing, the commission has acted in disregard of important constitutional mandates. The net result of the commission’s sua sponte conduct is a deprivation of appellants’ property rights under the fee agreement without due process of law. Curr v. Curr, 124 Idaho 686, 864 P.2d 132 (1993).

        Subdivision (2) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-706" target="_self">§ 72-706 </a></cite>allows a claimant to apply for a hearing against an employer within five years from the date of the accident causing the injury or the date of first manifestation of an occupational disease. A dismissal with prejudice prior to the expiration of the five-year period when a claimant sought a dismissal without prejudice would be inconsistent with the claimant’s right to apply for a hearing within five years; this would violate the authority given to the commission in this section to adopt judicial rules “not inconsistent with law.” Burton v.

        The industrial commission correctly found that employer’s failure to file the<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c06s72-602" target="_self">§ 72-602 </a></cite>report was not willful, where the claimant’s doctor’s note contained no specific language indicating that claimant’s underlying condition was caused by her work environment, and the employer’s failure to draw an inference to the contrary from the note was a simple misunderstanding of the doctor’s intent in issuing the note. Thus, even if this section were applicable to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-448" target="_self">§ 72-448</a></cite>, the time limitations would not be tolled, as this section only tolls limitations for willful failure to report.

        The final sentence of this section was intended to apply only in situations where the employer acknowledges liability for the injury at issue and voluntarily pays benefits for that injury. This provision, however, was not intended to address the abrupt discontinuation of benefits such as in the instant case, where the employer or surety ceases payments of benefits to contest liability.

        The commission’s finding that claimant failed to give timely notice of his accident to the employer was correct, where the record indicated that the employer did not learn that claimant was claiming a work-related accident until some time after June 7, approximately four months after the date of the accident, and where prior to that time claimant had not filed an accident report with his employer, even though his position as warehouse foreman required him to participate in and become familiar with the plant’s safety program, including its policy of reporting every accident regardless of how minor it might be. Dick v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 100 Idaho 742, 605 P.2d 506 (1979).
    Injured worker, despite having given oral notice to his employer of his injury at the time it occurred, may not recover worker’s compensation benefits if he did not file a Notice of Injury and Claim for Benefits with the industrial commission within the time limit prescribed by statute.

       </p>
       <p>
        Injury was not compensable where the industrial commission determined that the claimant, a flagger on highway construction sites, did not report the accident to her employer within the 60 day period required by law, that the alleged accident did not occur, and that claimant’s concededly debilitated condition was not sufficiently causally related to any incident that occurred during the course of her employment for it to be compensable.

        Worker’s compensation claimant’s vague statement to her supervisor “I was having problems with my back” was ambiguous and insufficient to give the required notice of an accident and injury under this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-702" target="_self">§ 72-702</a></cite>, particularly in view of her prior history of back problems.

        Plaintiff admitted that she did not give written notice of her injuries until 73 to 80 days after the second accident, therefore written notice was not timely under this section. Taylor v. Soran Restaurant, Inc., 131 Idaho 525, 960 P.2d 1254 (1998).

        Employee’s worker’s compensation claim was properly denied because the employee failed to notify his employer of his fall at work within 60 days of the fall. Arel v. T & L Enters., 146 Idaho 29, 189 P.3d 1149 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the employee denied suffering any physical injury for much of the litigation, and the claim that she had suffered injuries to her brain was first raised much later, the industrial commission could reasonably conclude that the employer did not have knowledge that the employee suffered a physical injury as a result of police interviews; substantial and competent evidence supported the finding that the employer did not have the knowledge required to excuse the employee’s failure to give proper notice of her claim for worker’s compensation benefits.

        “As Soon as Practicable.”
       </h5>
       <p>
        “As soon as practicable” had to be reasonable taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the particular case, and there was nothing in the law to justify a delay of 39 days in giving notice. That the employer was ignorant of the law, even under a liberal construction, was not a good excuse. Frost v. Idaho Gold Dredging Co., 54 Idaho 312, 31 P.2d 270 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        “As soon as practicable” should have been given a liberal construction so as not to defeat, without just cause, the compensation to which a meritorious claimant was entitled. Injury developed gradually and its seriousness and nature were unknown for some weeks. Notice was given 51 days after accident. Woodbury v. Frank B. Arata Fruit Co., 64 Idaho 227, 130 P.2d 870 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employee asserted that he had received a personal injury caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment and sought compensation for the injury, he should have given notice of the accident to his employer as soon as practicable within not later than sixty days after the happening thereof. Ansbaugh v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 80 Idaho 515, 334 P.2d 442 (1959).

        Claim, Filing of.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Compensation claimant, who had never served notice of deceased employee’s injury, nor claim for compensation, could not recover from employer, irrespective of whether the statute prescribing the time limit for filing claim was mandatory, or whether it could be waived by failure to plead it. Smith v. McHan Hdwe. Co., 56 Idaho 43, 48 P.2d 1102 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compensation could not be recovered where the claim was not filed within the time required by law. In re Pahlke, 56 Idaho 338, 53 P.2d 1177 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of compensation made voluntarily by the employer, the making and filing claim therefor was not required, and the burden in these circumstances rested upon the state to prove the deceased employee left no dependents. State ex rel. Wright v. Smith, 60 Idaho 316, 91 P.2d 389 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] made an award based upon the recommendation of the medical adviser to the manager of the state insurance fund, and compensation was paid thereunder without dissent or complaint, the board under these circumstances had jurisdiction to make an order, and where the employee knew of the nature of the order under which he received compensation, such order was not subject to an assailment on any ground of irregularity after a lapse of 20 years. McGarrigle v. Grangeville Elec. Light & Power Co., 60 Idaho 690, 97 P.2d 402 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compensation for the loss of a leg or other member may have been recovered after his death, even though no award was made prior to the death, since the award did not fix the right to, only determine, the amount of compensation for the injury; the right to compensation was fixed by the statute, the amount was merely an administrative detail. Thacker v. Jerome Co-op. Creamery, 61 Idaho 726, 106 P.2d 863 (1940).
    Settlement with estate of deceased of claim filed by deceased which stated that it was not concerned with liability for death was not an admission that death claim had been filed where none in fact had been filed. Judd v. Rinelli, 75 Idaho 121, 268 P.2d 671 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial accident board [now industrial commission] had jurisdiction of workmen’s compensation proceeding brought by employer and its surety for award to injured minor workman where employee had filed no claim and, though not formally shown in the records, there was an action pending in the United States district court involving same parties and same state of facts. Lockard v. St. Maries Lumber Co., 75 Idaho 497, 274 P.2d 995 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state insurance fund was an independent agency and was not an arm of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] and had the status of a private insurance company. Therefore the filing of a claim with the state insurance fund was not the equivalent of and did not meet the requirement of the filing of a claim with the industrial accident board [now industrial commission]. Atwood v. State, Dep’t of Agric., 80 Idaho 349, 330 P.2d 325 (1958).

        Statutes relating notice of injury and claim for compensation and death benefits were construed together. State ex rel. Wright v. Smith, 60 Idaho 316, 91 P.2d 389 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision for notice to be given to the employer by and on behalf of an injured employee should be broadly and liberally construed to effectuate the main purpose of all of such acts. Long v. Brown, 64 Idaho 39, 128 P.2d 754 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute relating notice of injury and claim for compensation was merely a statute of limitation and may be waived. Rivera v. Johnston, 71 Idaho 70, 225 P.2d 858 (1950).

        Date of Accident.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The statute prescribed the time within which claims for compensation had to be made and served, and this time commenced to run from the date of the accident instead of the first manifestation of a compensable injury. Moody v. State Hwy. Dep’t, 56 Idaho 21, 48 P.2d 1108 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        The accident sustained by lode mining employee who contracted silicosis was completed when the disease became so bad the employee was forced to cease working, and the one-year period within which claim for compensation had to be filed began to run from such date. Brown v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 49, 87 P.2d 1000 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it appeared from the evidence that the date of the accumulation accident from silicosis could reasonably be considered to have definitely and ultimately occurred at the time the deceased employee ceased to work, it was sufficient as the fixing of the date of the accident. Nixon v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 64, 87 P.2d 1007 (1938).

        Death.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A claim filed within one year after the death of an employee was timely, even though it was more than a year after the accident. Nixon v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 64, 87 P.2d 1007 (1938).
    A dependent of a deceased employee had one year after the employee’s death in which to file a claim, even though the employee had filed no claim within his lifetime. Nixon v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 60 Idaho 64, 87 P.2d 1007 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case no claim for compensation was made by a dependent of a deceased employee and filed with the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] within a year after the death, or in case a claim was made and filed within such year and no dependency was proven, it was then proper to make an order requiring the employer to pay $1000 into the state treasury. State ex rel. Wright v. Smith, 60 Idaho 316, 91 P.2d 389 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a dependent father and the employer, after they had been informed that the workmen’s compensation insurance policy had been canceled by the state insurance fund, and with full knowledge of the facts bearing on the question of dependency, agreed on the amount which was to be paid for funeral expenses and compensation by the employer to the dependent father, and it appearing that they acted in good faith, and that the amount agreed upon was thereafter paid, the failure to file a claim with such board did not render the employer liable to pay $1000 into the state treasury. State ex rel. Wright v. Smith, 60 Idaho 316, 91 P.2d 389 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        If dependents failed to file death claim within one year following death, the death claim was barred even though claim filed by deceased was pending on the date of his death. Judd v. Rinelli, 75 Idaho 121, 268 P.2d 671 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellants had the duty of filing their claim for compensation as dependents with industrial accident board [now industrial commission] within one year after the death of the employee and the correspondence relied upon to show either a filing of a claim with the state insurance fund or a waiver of the one-year limitation was not sufficient. Atwood v. State, Dep’t of Agric., 80 Idaho 349, 330 P.2d 325 (1958).

        In a case of hernia, the knowledge of employer had to be within 30 days. Page v. State Ins. Fund, 53 Idaho 177, 22 P.2d 681 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        An application for hearing, if it be the notice required herein, filed more than 60 days after accident, was too late. Eldridge v. Idaho State Penitentiary, 54 Idaho 213, 30 P.2d 781 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a claimant for compensation for a hernia informed her employer’s manager immediately upon receiving injuries that she had hurt her side and gave him all of her available information with respect to injuries, the hernia was reported within 30 days so as to authorize an award of compensation. Hancock v. Troy-Parisian Co., 60 Idaho 576, 94 P.2d 674 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that notice of an accident be given to the employer was to give him timely opportunity to make an investigation of the accident and surrounding circumstances to avoid payment of an unjust claim. Long v. Brown, 64 Idaho 39, 128 P.2d 754 (1942).
    A notice given by way of respondent’s claim for health benefits under group insurance wherein he claimed occupational disability “due to extra work” without actually reporting any accident specifically avoiding any theory of accident further by crossing that word from the group insurance form and stating the words “extra work” was not sufficient to apprise appellant employer of any accident arising out of and in the course of employment causing personal injury. Ansbaugh v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 80 Idaho 515, 334 P.2d 442 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defense of the statutory employer that claimant failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, particularly claiming employer did not have timely notice in that notice was not given for 85 days of the accident and that the employer was not afforded the opportunity to provide claimant with reasonable medical and kindred services was substantiated by the evidence establishing resultant prejudice to employer. Findley v. Flanigan, 84 Idaho 473, 373 P.2d 551 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Christensen v. Calico Constr. & Dev. Co., 97 Idaho 327, 543 P.2d 1167 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        If employer wished to contest the timeliness of the notice, he had to bear the burden of showing that it was not given “as soon as practicable.” Garren v. J. R. Simplot Co., 93 Idaho 458, 463 P.2d 558 (1969).

       <p>
        Since injury and accident are not to be construed as synonymous and the statute required claim to be filed within one year after accident, a claim filed within one year after compensable injury manifested itself but not within a year after the accident was too late. Moody v. State Hwy. Dep’t, 56 Idaho 21, 48 P.2d 1108 (1935); Smith v. McHan Hdwe. Co., 56 Idaho 43, 48 P.2d 1102 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        The running of the statute of limitations did not deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction; it merely barred relief. Rivera v. Johnston, 71 Idaho 70, 225 P.2d 858 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of limitations relative to giving of notice and making claims did not apply to proceeding to recover compensation from second injury fund, since payments were not made from second injury fund until after employer had completed payment of compensation. Anderson v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 77 Idaho 263, 291 P.2d 859 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Correspondence consisting of five letters, communications between the state insurance fund and the attorney for the appellants could not be considered as equivalent to the filing of the claim for benefits inasmuch as such correspondence did not show any facts upon which could be predicated a claim of waiver of the requirement that the dependency claim had to be filed with the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] within one year after the death of the employee; nor any facts sufficient to bar respondents by way of estoppel from asserting the statute of limitations. Atwood v. State, Dep’t of Agric., 80 Idaho 349, 330 P.2d 325 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflicting evidence as to the date the disabling accident occurred, with the earlier date in evidence being more than a year prior to the filing of the claim, was sufficient to sustain the board’s finding that the claim was barred. Gregg v. Orr, 92 Idaho 30, 436 P.2d 245 (1967).

        In workmen’s compensation proceedings, state insurance fund’s withdrawal of its answer and denials, and its admission of claimant’s allegations, that death arose out of and in the course of the employment, amounted to a waiver of the requirement of the statute relating to notice of injury and claim for compensation.

        The worker’s compensation statutes contain no provision, such as this section which preserves claims despite untimely notice of the accident to the employer in certain circumstances, that excuses the late filing of a claim.

       <p>
        Where claimant sought to justify 266 days between the date of the alleged accident and the filing of notice of injury by claiming that there would have been no change in either the surety’s investigation or in the medical treatment claimant received had timely notice been given, claimant failed to discharge his obligation of proving that employer and surety either had knowledge of the accident or were not prejudiced by the failure to give prompt notice.

       <p>
        Where employee filed worker’s compensation claim seven months after the accident and injury, the employer did not have an opportunity to investigate the alleged accident and injury or to have the employee examined; consequently, the employer was prejudiced by the delay of notice and claimant failed to satisfy her burden of proof to show employer was not prejudiced.

        The policy reason behind this section is to notify the employer of potential claims but at the same time preserve claims despite lack of notice where the employer had actual knowledge or is not prejudiced by lack of notice. That policy is inapplicable to the requirement that a claim be filed with the industrial commission within a certain time after the accident. Petry v.

        In an action for worker’s compensation, the burden of proof is on a claimant who has not given notice of the accident to show that no prejudice resulted to the employer on account of such want of giving notice.

        If an employer is not given the required written notice of an alleged accident, and there is no knowledge of the alleged injury, a workers’ compensation benefits claimant has the burden of setting forth affirmative proof that employer was not prejudiced by the delay in giving notice.

        The commission’s finding that claimant failed to give timely notice of his accident to the employer was correct, where the record indicated that the employer did not learn that claimant was claiming a work-related accident until some time after June 7, approximately four months after the date of the accident, and where prior to that time claimant had not filed an accident report with his employer, even though his position as warehouse foreman required him to participate in and become familiar with the plant’s safety program, including its policy of reporting every accident regardless of how minor it might be. Dick v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 100 Idaho 742, 605 P.2d 506 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the employee denied suffering any physical injury for much of the litigation, and the claim that she had suffered injuries to her brain was first raised much later, the industrial commission could reasonably conclude that the employer did not have knowledge that the employee suffered a physical injury as a result of police interviews; substantial and competent evidence supported the finding that the employer did not have the knowledge required to excuse the employee’s failure to give proper notice of her claim for worker’s compensation benefits.

       <p>
        Claimant not giving notice had burden of showing that employer, agent, or representative had knowledge of accident, or that no prejudice resulted to employer on account of delay in giving notice. Bodah v. Coeur d’Alene Mill Co., 44 Idaho 680, 258 P. 1079 (1927); Wilson v. Standard Oil Co., 47 Idaho 208, 273 P. 758 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of showing lack of prejudice because no notice was given was on the employee; and if the notice required by the statute was given as soon as practicable and within 60 days, no excuse was necessary. If not as soon as practicable, though within 60 days, the employee had to show lack of prejudice. Frost v. Idaho Gold Dredging Co., 54 Idaho 312, 31 P.2d 270 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence was conflicting as to whether the disability, lasting beyond a conceded period of three weeks, was the result of an accident or due to “Dupuytren’s Contracture,” which one doctor testified the employee was suffering from, being a progressive chronic development in men of his age, the board was justified in holding that the employee had not met the burden of proof with respect to nonprejudice, placed on him by the statute, and he was not entitled to compensation beyond the three week period. Frost v. Idaho Gold Dredging Co., 54 Idaho 312, 31 P.2d 270 (1934).

        Want or delay of written notice was not a bar to compensation, if employer had knowledge of accident or was not prejudiced. Bodah v. Coeur d’Alene Mill Co., 44 Idaho 680, 258 P. 1079 (1927); Crowley v. Idaho Indus. Training Sch., 53 Idaho 606, 26 P.2d 180 (1933).

        Knowledge of employer had to be within 60 days. Cooper v. Independent Transf. & Storage Co., 52 Idaho 747, 19 P.2d 1057 (1933). Not mentioned but in effect overruled in Frost v. Idaho Gold Dredging Co., 54 Idaho 312, 31 P.2d 270 (1934).

        Lack of statutory notice was no bar on finding of actual notice. Cooper v. Independent Transf. & Storage Co., 52 Idaho 747, 19 P.2d 1057 (1933).

       <p>
        Knowledge, on the part of the employer’s agent, of injury to a housemaid within the time that same be reported, and within the time that she was required to give notice, was sufficient notice to employer. Page v. State Ins. Fund, 53 Idaho 177, 22 P.2d 681 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employer possessed the same knowledge as an employee, the fact that an employee did not report a hernia by designation, when in truth and in fact, it was such, would not warrant a refusal of compensation on that ground. Page v. State Ins. Fund, 53 Idaho 177, 22 P.2d 681 (1933).
    Where a woman in a hospital was a matron, more or less of a general housekeeper and took care of the nurses and acted as general adviser and mother; had general supervision of the nurses’ quarters; hired and discharged the help, subject to the approval of the superintendent; kept the time and had charge of the other maids in the hospital, and had supervision of the housekeeping, a housemaid informing her of an injury, was sufficient notice to the employer. Page v. State Ins. Fund, 53 Idaho 177, 22 P.2d 681 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the employer had knowledge through his or its superintendent, the delay in giving the written notice required by law was no bar to the right of compensation. Crowley v. Idaho Indus. Training Sch., 53 Idaho 606, 26 P.2d 180 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The employer had notice, where the employee discussed his injury with the employer’s superintendent, as notice to the superintendent was notice to the employer. Feuling v. Farmers’ Co-op. Ditch Co., 54 Idaho 326, 31 P.2d 683 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it was conclusively shown that the foreman, under and with whom claimant worked, had knowledge of the conditions under which he was employed, the fact that he was breathing rock dust, that he coughed as a result of breathing it, that his cough became worse, that he had a hemorrhage of the lungs, that he gradually grew physically weaker, that he lost weight, did not sleep, had no appetite and that one foreman assisted in making out his claim, this was sufficient to bring the employee within the rule as to the sufficiency of notice. Beaver v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 55 Idaho 275, 41 P.2d 605 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Knowledge on the part of the employer within the time provided for giving notice rendered notice unnecessary. Stoddard v. Mason’s Blue Link Stores, 55 Idaho 609, 45 P.2d 597 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it sufficiently appeared that the employer knew the conditions under which the employee was working and had the same knowledge of the accident that the employee had, that was sufficient to dispense with notice. Smith v. McHan Hdwe. Co., 56 Idaho 43, 48 P.2d 1102 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the employer had actual knowledge that was equal to notice, a failure of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] to make a finding that the injury was reported within 30 days after the accident was immaterial. Smith v. Mercy Hosp., 60 Idaho 674, 95 P.2d 580 (1939).

       <p>
        Where a representative of the employer was in the cab of a locomotive used in logging operations at the time of injury, another discussed the accident with respondent and later gave him a ticket to the hospital to obtain better treatment than was available at headquarters, employer had timely knowledge of said accident.

       <p>
        Where the employer’s shop foreman was with claimant at the time of the accident and reported such accident directly to the employer and another employee prepared the notice and claim for compensation about six weeks later, claimant gave sufficient and proper notice to his employer of his accident and injury. Facer v. E.R. Steed Equip. Co., 95 Idaho 608, 514 P.2d 841 (1973). Prejudice of Employer’s Rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim was barred only to the extent the employer was prejudiced by lack of notice. Frost v. Idaho Gold Dredging Co., 54 Idaho 312, 31 P.2d 270 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though employer was in fact prejudiced by reason of lack of knowledge of employee’s injury, he was not prejudiced as a matter of law if he had knowledge of the accident, though no injury was apparent at the time. Feuling v. Farmers’ Co-op. Ditch Co., 54 Idaho 326, 31 P.2d 683 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a physician employed by the employer examined an injured workman, but declined to treat him or examine him further upon the ground that the injury was the result of a previous disease rather than an accident, the employer was not prejudiced, in these circumstances by the failure of the employee to give further notice of the accident, and the employer may not have complained thereof, it affirmatively appearing that the employer was not injured by the delay of notice of the accident, even though it was conceded the notice to the physician was not notice to the employer under the statute, although there was authority to the contrary. Arneson v. Robinson, 59 Idaho 223, 82 P.2d 249 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no formal notice was given within the statutory time, and the employer had no knowledge of the accident, but there has been no prejudice by the delay, there was an award for compensation. Clayton v. Hercules Mining Co., 64 Idaho 34, 127 P.2d 762 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employer with sufficient warning and opportunity to investigate was not prejudiced. Clayton v. Hercules Mining Co., 64 Idaho 34, 127 P.2d 762 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word “prejudice” in the provision of the act that delay in giving notice of accident to the employer would not bar a compensation proceeding in the absence of prejudice to the employer meant that the employer, by failure to receive notice, had been made less able to resist the claim. Long v. Brown, 64 Idaho 39, 128 P.2d 754 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence warranted award of compensation as a matter of law on the ground that the failure to give timely notice of injury did not “prejudice” the employer, in that he was not made less able to resist the claim by failure to receive notice, inasmuch as he would have made no investigation if such notice had been given but would have merely reported the accident to the insurance company, who did have timely notice of the accident and ample opportunity to make a full investigation. Long v. Brown, 64 Idaho 39, 128 P.2d 754 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employer was not notified of injury until more than 60 days after accident, the failure to so notify employer did not prejudice employer’s rights since it was shown that it would have been impossible to render medical or surgical aid to relieve the situation. Moser v. Utah Oil Ref. Co., 66 Idaho 710, 168 P.2d 591 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence sustained finding delay in giving notice of injury to employer was prejudicial to employer’s interests and deprived employer of opportunity to make timely investigation and furnish hospitalization, precluding recovery. Lescinski v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 67 Idaho 98, 170 P.2d 605 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proof was on a claimant who had not given, or who had delayed giving notice of the accident, to show that no prejudice resulted to the employer on account of such want of, or delay in, giving notice and that claimant’s failure to discharge such burden of proof as showing employer was not prejudiced by the failure to give notice or that they had knowledge of the accident would be a complete bar to an award of compensation. Ansbaugh v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 80 Idaho 515, 334 P.2d 442 (1959).
    The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] found, after finding that claimant failed to give any written notice to respondent company until 85 days after the accident and that the company had no knowledge of the industrial accident involving the claimant, that the respondent was prejudiced by such delay, claimant having undergone surgery in such time, and such delay served as a complete bar. Findley v. Flanigan, 84 Idaho 473, 373 P.2d 551 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Christensen v. Calico Constr. & Dev. Co., 97 Idaho 327, 543 P.2d 1167 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employer was not prejudiced by delay in receiving notice of a second injury to the claimant in a different employment where the board’s apportionment of compensation and medical expense liability to such employer was confined to the period subsequent to such notice. Dawson v. Hartwick, 91 Idaho 561, 428 P.2d 480 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes relating to sufficiency of notice applied to the provision regarding hernia and it was error to dismiss a claimant’s claim without granting the claimant’s request that the board hear evidence that the employer was not prejudiced by a two-day lateness in reporting claimant’s hernia to the employer. Christensen v. West, 92 Idaho 87, 437 P.2d 359 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if employer assumed the burden of proof that notice was not given “as soon as practicable,” the claimant may still have recovered, provided he showed by a preponderance of the evidence that employer had not been prejudiced by such delay or had actual knowledge. Garren v. J. R. Simplot Co., 93 Idaho 458, 463 P.2d 558 (1969).

        The defense of the statutory employer that claimant failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, particularly claiming employer did not have timely notice in that notice was not given for 85 days of the accident and that the employer was not afforded the opportunity to provide claimant with reasonable medical and kindred services was substantiated by the evidence establishing resultant prejudice to employer. Findley v. Flanigan, 84 Idaho 473, 373 P.2d 551 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Christensen v. Calico Constr. & Dev. Co., 97 Idaho 327, 543 P.2d 1167 (1975).

Findley v. Flanigan, 84 Idaho 473, 373 P.2d 551 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Christensen v. Calico Constr. & Dev. Co., 97 Idaho 327, 543 P.2d 1167 (1975).

        This section’s statute of limitations does not apply to the time for filing claims for disability, but rather applies to the time for filing applications for hearings before the industrial commission. Bainbridge v. Boise Cascade Plywood Mill, 111 Idaho 79, 721 P.2d 179 (1986).

        Employee’s written claim for benefits was a “claim” for the purposes of subsection (1); while the claim was filed prior to the employee’s visits to a new physician, the surety became aware of the new physician’s involvement through correspondence prior to the hearing, and this knowledge, combined with the claim, gave the employer and surety time to pay for the treatment, and thus the employee effectively petitioned the Idaho industrial commission for a change of physician pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-432" target="_self">§ 72-432</a></cite>(4).

       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial competent evidence to support the industrial commission’s finding that prior to the expiration of the five-year time period for filing an application for a workers’ compensation hearing, the claimant and the employer, as well as the claimant and the employer’s heirs, became engaged in consultations and negotiations concerning a claim, that these negotiations may have possibly lead claimant to believe that no decision had been made by employer and that it was not necessary to file an application for hearing, and that claimant’s claim was not time barred. Swenson v. Estate of Craner, 117 Idaho 57, 785 P.2d 621 (1990).
    Where a claimant’s attorney sent a letter to the employer’s insurance carrier referencing the claimant’s accident and claim, this constituted proper notice of the claim to the employer, so a complaint filed within one year of the notice was timely filed under this section. Tonahill v. Legrand Johnson Constr. Co., 131 Idaho 737, 963 P.2d 1174 (1998).

        When claimant was injured during the course of his employment with respondent employer on October 13, 2000, claimant gave notice of the accident and received income benefits beginning on August 15, 2001. The payment ending on June 5, 2006, was marked “final.” Because claimant filed his claim with the Idaho industrial commission within one year from the date of the last payment, the claim was timely filed, and the extension of the statute of limitations, provided by subsection (3) of this section, applied.

       <p>
        “Compensation” is a word of art under the Workmen’s Compensation Act and refers to income and medical benefits made under the provisions of the Act. Bainbridge v. Boise Cascade Plywood Mill, 111 Idaho 79, 721 P.2d 179 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The medical and insurance benefits paid under group policies provided by the employer were not “payments of compensation” within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section; therefore, the statute of limitations was not extended. Bainbridge v. Boise Cascade Plywood Mill, 111 Idaho 79, 721 P.2d 179 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        As referred to in subsection (2), “compensation” has been defined as either income or medical benefits. Fowler v. City of Rexburg, 116 Idaho 609, 773 P.2d 269 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because medical benefits are included in the definition of compensation under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102</a></cite>, the payment of medical benefits under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-432" target="_self">§ 72-432 </a></cite>must be taken into account under subsection (2) of this section to determine whether compensation was being paid when the limitation period provided in subsection (2) of this section expired.

       </p>
       <p>
        A compensation agreement between a workmen’s compensation claimant and the state insurance fund which clearly provided for an award of disability, and which was approved by the industrial commission, became an “award” which, under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-711" target="_self">§§ 72-711 </a></cite>and 72-718 was final and conclusive as to claimant’s disability and this section had no application to it.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although industrial accident occurred in 1975, the industrial commission correctly applied the revised version of subsection (2) of this section, because the 1978 statute was enacted before the claimant’s five year period under the old statute had run. Kindred v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 114 Idaho 284, 756 P.2d 401 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (2) of this section allows a claimant to apply for hearing against an employer within five years from the date of the accident causing the injury or the date of first manifestation of an occupational disease. A dismissal with prejudice prior to the expiration of the five-year period when a claimant sought a dismissal without prejudice would be inconsistent with the claimant’s right to apply for a hearing within five years; this would violate the authority given to the commission in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c05s72-508" target="_self">§ 72-508 </a></cite>to adopt judicial rules “not inconsistent with law.” Burton v.

       <p>
        Employer’s and surety’s failure to issue a Notice of Claim Status with a worker’s final benefit payment was “willful.” As the failure was not accidental, the one-year statute of limitations for seeking additional benefits was tolled.

        Temporary payment of compensation by the out-of-state surety of claimant’s previous employer, under the mistaken belief that claimant was still working for the previous employer, did not toll the time limitation on claimant’s application for a hearing, where neither the subsequent employer nor his surety received notice of claimant’s accident or injury within the statutory time.

        Income benefits are time barred by subsection (2) of this section unless the industrial commission has retained jurisdiction of the claim; thus, where the commission closed the file on the claimant’s case but noted that the closure was subject to determination of the permanent disability, if any, the commission clearly indicated its intent to retain jurisdiction of the claim and the claimant’s claim for an award of permanent disability was not barred even though it was not filed within five years of the date of the accident.

       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission did not err in denying an employee’s claim for more benefits as the point of the statute was to allow hurt workers to have time to file for income compensation once some sense of their medical condition was known as well as to allow employers freedom from further liability; if workers could claim that benefits received after the fourth anniversary, yet not related to a specific benefits payout spanning the fourth anniversary, reset the one-year window, employers could potentially never be absolved of their responsibilities.

        When payment of compensation is discontinued more than five years after the date of the injury, the claimant has one year following the date of the last payment in which to file an application for further compensation and award; accordingly, where the employer discontinued paying total temporary disability benefits five years and six months after the date of the claimant’s injury, the claimant had one year from the date of the last payment to apply for further compensation.

        The language of subsection (2) of this section, that allows the filing of an application for a hearing within one year of the last payment of compensation “if compensation is discontinued more than five (5) years from the date of the accident causing the injury,” necessarily implies that compensation was being paid on the fifth anniversary of the accident and was thereafter discontinued. Consequently, the statute’s one-year extension for filing hearing applications does not apply if no compensation was being paid on the fifth anniversary of a claimant’s injury causing accident.

        Where employer asserted that the accident occurred earlier than the limitation period so that employee’s action was barred by the statute of limitations, but evidence introduced without objection corroborated by employee’s testimony showed the accident to have occurred at a later date so that the petition would not be barred, such evidence was sufficient to sustain the industrial accident board’s [now industrial commission] finding that the accident occurred at such later date.

        The statutory limitations for filing of claim and filing of petition for a hearing were not extended by provision regarding assessment of a penalty for failure of employer to make accident reports to the board. Arnold v. Claude Lacey & Son, 73 Idaho 1, 245 P.2d 398 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        The four-year [now five-year] limitation was held to have been waived where it was shown that though there was no attempt to mislead claimant, claimant had no advice of counsel until the period was about to expire and the fund continued to ask for medical examinations and reports, the expenses of which it authorized and paid, and the furnishing of back supports during this period of time, all of which very well could have led claimant to believe that the employer and the fund had not reached a final decision either as to the end of the healing period or the evaluation of permanent partial disability. Lindskog v. Rosebud Mines, Inc., 84 Idaho 160, 369 P.2d 580 (1962).

        It was the claimant’s obligation to prove that the statute had been tolled by the payment of compensation. Shell v. Standard Oil Co., 93 Idaho 370, 461 P.2d 265 (1969).

        It was possible under certain conditions to waive the statute of limitations on the filing of request for a hearing on a claim by payment of wages and medical bills of a claimant. Bottoms v. Pioneer Irrigation Dist., 95 Idaho 487, 511 P.2d 304 (1973).

        Medical Expenses as Compensation.

       <p>
        As claimant received a payment for medical expenses during the period of time between the date of accident and filing a claim for compensation and as payment of hospital and medical expenses was included within the term “compensation,” the payment of compensation to claimant tolled the one year statute of limitations and made the four year statute of limitations applicable.

        Period for Filing.

       <p>
        Since the language of former law providing the time and manner in which claims for compensation were to be made was unambiguous in stating that the four year period during which a claim for compensation could be filed should run from the date of the “accident” and not from the date of the “injury” argument of claimant that time for filing claim should not begin to run until first manifestation of compensable injuries was without merit.

        The Idaho industrial commission has exclusive jurisdiction of all questions arising under worker’s compensation law; however, chiropractor’s claim against worker’s compensation surety to recover for intentional interference with prospective economic relationship with worker did not arise under, nor require interpretation or application of worker’s compensation law; thus, the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission was not implicated and magistrate court had jurisdiction.

        Idaho industrial commission lacked jurisdiction over the issue of whether an insurance policy obtained by claimant lessor for a lessee (a truck driver), which contained a forged signature, was valid because it involved a separate tort for which Idaho’s workers’ compensation law provided no remedy; regardless, it was not necessary to address the issue of validity because the lessee would not have been covered under the policy even it were valid because he had not elected coverage.

        An employee’s action against the industrial commission and the insurance fund and several of their respective employees alleging that she was injured in an industrial accident and received an inadequate award for those injuries was properly dismissed as district courts are expressly forbidden to exercise any jurisdiction in any cause seeking to in any way interfere with the actions or jurisdiction of the industrial commission.

        Class Actions.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The workmen’s compensation law does not specifically mandate that the industrial commission entertain class action proceedings. Monroe v. Chapman, 105 Idaho 269, 668 P.2d 1000 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the industrial commission has the power to adopt a rule which would permit a class action proceeding before it, it has not chosen to adopt such a rule and this inaction does not constitute a denial of due process; accordingly, commission’s order stating that it did not have authority to entertain class action was affirmed. Monroe v. Chapman, 105 Idaho 269, 668 P.2d 1000 (1983).

       <h5 id="t72c07s72-708-CASENOTES-evidence">
        Evidence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Once the industrial commission places new evidence into the record, all parties should have a right to dispute that evidence by challenging its validity or by introducing additional or conflicting evidence; thus, it was error for the commission not to allow the industrial special indemnity fund to dispute the physician’s rating of 12% impairment with respect to the claimant’s arm. Mapusaga v. Red Lion Riverside Inn, 113 Idaho 842, 748 P.2d 1372 (1987), overruled on other grounds, Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, 117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial commission erred when it refused to consider the medical treatise offered without proper foundation by pro se claimant; although these errors were most unfortunate they were, in this particular case, harmless. Hagler v. Micron Technology, Inc., 118 Idaho 596, 798 P.2d 55 (1990).
    Strict adherence to the rules of evidence is not required in industrial commission proceedings and admission of evidence in such proceedings is more relaxed. Hagler v. Micron Technology, Inc., 118 Idaho 596, 798 P.2d 55 (1990).
       </p>
      </div>

       <h5 id="t72c07s72-708-CASENOTES-procedure">
        Procedure.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The supreme court vacated the industrial commission’s order and remanded for reconsideration because worker should not have been prejudiced by employer’s filing of a premature appeal and it was immaterial that the motion to amend was made after the testimony on liability was heard. There is no time limit on such motions in the industrial commission’s Rules of Judicial Practice and Procedure. Mortimer v. Riviera Apts., 122 Idaho 839, 840 P.2d 383 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the Idaho state insurance fund (SIF) appealed from final decisions and orders of the industrial commission to pay for approved medical services performed on two claimants’ work-related injuries, contending that the commission’s dispute resolution system for the approval of medical charges violated constitutional, statutory, and equitable concerns, the supreme court of Idaho found that although the SIF did not have a full, formal hearing, it had submitted briefs before the commission and filed an appeal from the commission’s decision with the court, thus the dispute resolution system enacted by the commission for the approval of disputed medical charges did provide parties with the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Boise Orthopedic Clinic v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, 128 Idaho 161, 911 P.2d 754 (1996).

        Purpose.
       </h5>
       <p>
        To hold that a claimant’s application for hearing cannot also be considered a claim for compensation would contravene the purpose of the act which is designed to avoid cumbersome procedures and technicalities of pleading so that, to the greatest extent possible, claims for compensation can be decided on their merits. Hattenburg v. Blanks, 98 Idaho 485, 567 P.2d 829 (1977).

        Purpose of Proceedings.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the inception of Idaho’s workers’ compensation act, industrial commission proceedings have been informal and designed for simplicity; the primary purpose of these proceedings being the attainment of justice in each individual case. Hagler v. Micron Technology, Inc., 118 Idaho 596, 798 P.2d 55 (1990).

       <p>
        In case of direct attack upon an award, no presumptions in favor of jurisdiction or due process could be indulged. Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho 264, 220 P. 1088 (1923), overruled on other grounds, University of Utah Hosp. ex rel. Harris v. Pence, 104 Idaho 172, 657 P.2d 469 (1982).
    Hearings before industrial accident board [now industrial commission], which had no interest in the controversy, though its employees had made investigations and orders, were not a denial of due process. The board was not in a true sense an adversary. Idaho Mut. Benefit Ass’n v. Robison, 65 Idaho 793, 154 P.2d 156 (1944).

       <p>
        Rules governing procedure before board should have been flexible and informal so that objects of act might be accomplished in summary manner, while preserving rights of parties and doing justice between them. In re Bones, 48 Idaho 85, 280 P. 223 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was a fact-finding, administrative body, and strict rules of procedure were not required to be followed, and it was the duty of that board to conduct its proceedings so as to promote justice and not to pervert the same. Feuling v. Farmers’ Co-op. Ditch Co., 54 Idaho 326, 31 P.2d 683 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        By the enactment of the workmen’s compensation act, the legislature intended to give the injured workman a speedy, summary and simple remedy for the recovery of compensation in all cases coming within its provisions, that strict rules of procedure are not required, and that in every case where compensation is not settled by agreement, the board, or a member thereof to whom the matter has been assigned, should make such inquiries and investigations as should be deemed proper. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The act manifested intent to give injured workman a speedy, summary and simple remedy for recovery of compensation, without strict rules of procedure. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Informal procedure, partly ex parte, characterized as irregular and summary, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, was upheld. McGarrigle v. Grangeville Elec. Light & Power Co., 60 Idaho 690, 97 P.2d 402 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute providing that when an instrument was pleaded in an answer the same was deemed admitted, unless plaintiff filed with the clerk within ten days after receiving a copy of the answer, an affidavit denying the same, and served a copy thereof on the defendant, did not apply to proceedings before the industrial accident board [now industrial commission]. O’Niel v. Madison Lumber & Mill Co., 61 Idaho 546, 105 P.2d 194 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule of liberal construction applied to board’s procedure. Stroscheim v. Shay, 63 Idaho 360, 120 P.2d 267 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearings before the board, though its employees had made investigations and orders, were not a denial of due process. The board was not in the true sense an adversary. Idaho Mut. Benefit Ass’n v. Robison, 65 Idaho 793, 154 P.2d 156 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding that proceedings under the workmen’s compensation law were not governed so strictly by evidentiary and procedural rules as applied in courts of law, the procedure before the board had to be as far as possible in accordance with the rules of equity and making an award to a claimant during a continuance ordered at the close of claimant’s evidence, without offering the defendants an opportunity to be heard in defense, was reversible error. Duggan v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 92 Idaho 262, 441 P.2d 172 (1968).

        The legislature, by adding the phrase “as to all matters adjudicated” when they enacted<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-718" target="_self">§ 72-718 </a></cite>in 1971, intended that decisions of the commission be final and conclusive only as to those matters actually adjudicated; this is a departure from the concept of pure res judicata, applied prior to 1971, which accorded decisions by the commission finality and conclusiveness as to all matters which were, or could have been, adjudicated. Therefore, a compensation agreement approved by the commission was only final and conclusive as to those matters actually considered by the commission. Woodvine v.

        Before the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] could approve an agreement for compensation, such agreement had to embrace the provisions of the law, or such provisions would be read into the same. Hanson v. Independent Sch. Dist. 11-J, 57 Idaho 297, 65 P.2d 733 (1937).

        The ambit of power of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was circumscribed by the statutes respecting the award of compensation, and the board was without authority to award lesser or different compensation than that prescribed by law, and the situation was not changed by virtue of the fact that the employee was suffering at the time he received the injury of a preexisting and progressive disease.

        While the board was authorized to approve an agreement of settlement, such agreement had to incorporate; otherwise there would be read into the agreement, the provisions of the workmen’s compensation act, and it was not within the power of the board to award a lesser or different compensation to claimant than that provided by the workmen’s compensation act.

        Appeal from the decision of the Idaho industrial commission was dismissed and remanded; the decision was not a final appealable order where the commission could not establish from the record the extent of the industrial special indemnity fund’s liability and retained jurisdiction over the issue to enable the parties to resolve the matter or present additional evidence for consideration.

        Where there was medical evidence from two doctors, one of whom thought the claimant’s elbow problem was causally related to his accident and the other doctor, who examined him right after the accident, who thought it was not related, there was substantial competent evidence to support the industrial commission’s conclusion that claimant’s elbow problems were the result of an independent, intervening cause and not causally related to his earlier on-the-job accidents.

        If the accident was one whose happening could not be fixed as of a specific date, it was sufficient to establish such time with reasonable probability. Roe v.

       <p>

       <p>
        Burden was upon employer to prove defense that employee was intoxicated. Potter v. Realty Trust Co., 60 Idaho 281, 90 P.2d 699 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proof was upon the dependent claimant to prove, in accordance with his condition, that transverse myelitis from which the decedent died was a result of the injury sustained by the deceased within the meaning of the workmen’s compensation law. Rand v. Lafferty Transp. Co., 60 Idaho 507, 92 P.2d 786 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The claimant had to prove an industrial injury caused by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, and in the event of death that death resulted from injury sustained. Swan v. Williamson, 74 Idaho 32, 257 P.2d 552 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        In contested workmen’s compensation cases, claimant had the burden of proof that an accident occurred which resulted in injury or death within the terms of the act, i.e., claimant had to show by a preponderance of the evidence an unexpected, undesigned and unlooked for mishap or untoward event which happened suddenly and was connected with the industry in which it occurred. Darvell v. Wardner Indus. Union, 78 Idaho 309, 302 P.2d 950 (1956).

        Latitude was permitted by the board in the admission of evidence, but its findings could not be based on incompetent evidence. Wilson v. Standard Oil Co., 47 Idaho 208, 273 P. 758 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the workmen’s compensation law it was not necessary to exclude the possibility or even some probability that another cause or reason may have been the true cause or reason for the damage rather than the one alleged by claimant. Roe v. Boise Grocery Co., 53 Idaho 82, 21 P.2d 910 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a civil case, which was applicable to workmen’s compensation proceedings, facts need not have been established beyond a reasonable doubt. It was sufficient if the evidence on the whole supported the hypothesis which it was produced to prove. Riley v. Boise City, 54 Idaho 335, 31 P.2d 968 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the evidence was in equipoise, a claimant may not recover compensation because the burden was on him to show compensable disability, and there had to be a probable and not merely a possible connection between the cause and effect. Carlson v. F. H. DeAtley & Co., 55 Idaho 713, 46 P.2d 1089 (1935); Stroscheim v. Shay, 63 Idaho 360, 120 P.2d 267 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at the time of the hearing before the board the employee was insane and his testimony, for that reason, was not available, this situation made applicable the rule often applied that where the lips of a witness had been sealed by death, the presumption was indulged in the absence of proof to the contrary, that one who was killed while engaged in his duties, was exercising reasonable care and precaution for the protection and preservation of his person and life, and that he was possessed of the ordinary instincts of self-preservation. Webb v. Gem State Oil Co., 56 Idaho 465, 55 P.2d 1302 (1936).
    Where the known facts were not equally significant where there was ground for comparing and balancing their respective values, and where the more probable conclusion was that for which the applicant for compensation contended an inference in his favor was justified. Soran v. McKelvey, 57 Idaho 483, 67 P.2d 906 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that a claimant asked another employee to tell the manager of the employer that he, the claimant, had been injured in an accident, did not constitute such employee an agent of the claimant, and any conversation had between such employee and the manager in pursuance of such request, in the absence of the claimant, constituted pure hearsay and was, therefore, incompetent, and such evidence was insufficient to create a conflict, making the board’s finding conclusive. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary that a claimant for compensation prove the exact manner in which he was injured. The law did not require such certainty of proof, and to so hold would defeat the very purpose of the workmen’s compensation law. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937); Golay v. Stoddard, 60 Idaho 168, 89 P.2d 1002 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The relation of employer and employee shown and well-nigh conceded to have existed immediately prior to the day of the accident would be presumed to continue to exist until the contrary was shown and the relationship changed. This presumption was rebuttable and slight or strong according to the attendant and surrounding circumstances, but it was legitimate for the board, and was for the supreme court, to consider in weighing the evidence as to deceased’s status. In re Black, 58 Idaho 803, 80 P.2d 24 (1938), overruled on other grounds, Hite v. Kulhenak Bldg. Contractors, 96 Idaho 70, 524 P.2d 531 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a witness gave some evidence, by deposition or otherwise, before he was sworn will not work a reversal of an award where the objecting party was given a full opportunity to make a searching cross-examination. Taylor v. Federal Mining & Smelting Co., 59 Idaho 183, 81 P.2d 728 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee in a proceeding for workmen’s compensation was bound by the evidence of the witness which he produced. Brooke v. Nolan, 59 Idaho 759, 87 P.2d 470 (1939). See also Van Meter v. Zumwalt, 35 Idaho 235, 206 P. 507 (1922); Groome v. Fisher, 48 Idaho 771, 284 P. 1030 (1930); Long v. Brown, 64 Idaho 39, 128 P.2d 754 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possibility or probability of another cause of damage than that alleged by compensation claimant did not defeat recovery where he presented sufficient facts to justify a reasonable conclusion that the thing charged was the prime and moving cause. Stilwell v. Aberdeen-Springfield Canal Co., 61 Idaho 357, 102 P.2d 296 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unsworn testimony or statements received without objection, on the trial of a case, may be considered the same as any other evidence in the case, and could not be subsequently urged to invalidate the judgment or order. Hamlin v. University of Idaho, 61 Idaho 570, 104 P.2d 625 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        The testimony describing the deceased’s physical condition was competent, relevant and admissible but conversations not in the presence of the employer were hearsay. Nistad v. Winton Lumber Co., 61 Idaho 1, 99 P.2d 52 (1940).

        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission], by reason of its experience, had to be presumed to be able to judge the causation factors in a particular case on both medical and nonmedical evidence. Walker v. Hogue, 67 Idaho 484, 185 P.2d 708 (1947). — Examination of Witnesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the liberal practice that should guide the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], the employer and insurance carrier should have been permitted to cross-examine claimant and his physician testifying with regard to claimant’s previous condition, although such was beyond the scope of the direct examination. This restriction was harmless, when the witnesses were subsequently called and examined at length. Patrick v. Smith Baking Co., 64 Idaho 190, 129 P.2d 651 (1942).

       <p>
        The testimony of an expert as to his opinion was not evidence of a fact in dispute, but was advisory, only, to assist the triers of fact, to understand and apply the testimony of other witnesses. Evans v. Cavanagh, 58 Idaho 324, 73 P.2d 83 (1937); Nistad v. Winton Lumber Co., 61 Idaho 1, 99 P.2d 52 (1939); Watkins v. Cavanagh, 61 Idaho 720, 107 P.2d 155 (1940).

        Evidence of attending physicians was sufficient to sustain a finding that the employee’s injury was the result of an accident, occurring during work, rather than of prior osteomyelitis, and this was true in spite of contravening expert testimony.

        The weight to be given expert testimony depended, among other things, on the expert’s knowledge, his competency, the extent of his experience or study, whether the witness was biased, the facts upon which his opinion was based, and the integrity of the witness himself. So, in a proceeding under this act, the weight to be given to the testimony of a physician, who observed and treated the claimant over a period of several months regarding permanency of the claimant’s disability, was a question for the industrial accident board [now industrial commission]. Stroscheim v. Shay, 63 Idaho 360, 120 P.2d 267 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The weight to be afforded the testimony of a physician as an expert was for the board to determine, and there was no distinction between expert testimony and evidence of other character in this respect. Stroscheim v. Shay, 63 Idaho 360, 120 P.2d 267 (1941); Walker v. Hogue, 67 Idaho 484, 185 P.2d 708 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        More weight had to be given to the testimony of the expert who testified from first hand knowledge gained on autopsy examination than to the testimony of one whose knowledge was based only upon hypothetical facts. In re Cain, 64 Idaho 389, 133 P.2d 723 (1943); Cameron v. Bradley Mining Co., 66 Idaho 409, 160 P.2d 461 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where compensation for permanent partial disability was awarded as a result of the opinions of two physicians to that effect, and the report of a third physician who refused to estimate the extent of the disability, the claimant on application filed 24 days after the conclusion of the hearing before the entire industrial accident board [now industrial commission] may be granted a rehearing to introduce testimony of three additional physicians who examined him after the first hearing that he was permanently and totally disabled. Lay v. Idaho State Sch. and Colony, 64 Idaho 455, 133 P.2d 923 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        On medical question, opinion of experts was substantive evidence and basis of award had to be supported by substantive evidence. Zipse v. Schmidt Bros., 66 Idaho 30, 154 P.2d 171 (1944).
    A doctor’s testimony of first hand information of claimant’s condition causing his death based on a daily attendance at the hospital, study of x-rays, sputum tests, blood cultures, serological tests and stethoscopic examinations was entitled to greater weight than that of doctors based on hypothetical state of facts or x-rays. Stralovich v. Sunshine Mining Co., 68 Idaho 524, 201 P.2d 106 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant did not call nonresident physicians to testify, board did not err in failing to call physicians, since claimant had the right to call them, and board furthermore could not require attendance of nonresident physicians. Koegler v. C.F. Davidson Co., 69 Idaho 416, 209 P.2d 728 (1949).

        Cause of death may be shown by direct or circumstantial evidence but it was not sufficient for claimant to establish a state of facts which was as consistent with as against right to compensation.

        In the final analysis it was for the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] to decide the value and credit to be given to evidence.

       </p>
       <p>
        The question for the board to determine in compensation cases was not whether there was corroborating evidence of the claimant, but whether there was sufficient competent evidence to establish the claim for compensation. Fields v. Buffalo-Idaho Mining Co., 55 Idaho 212, 40 P.2d 114 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Medical evidence that the conditions for which compensation was claimed could have been caused under such conditions as would require the payment of compensation, and not that it was probably so caused, was insufficient to sustain an award. Brooke v. Nolan, 59 Idaho 759, 87 P.2d 470 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no evidence in the record that a claimant for compensation suffered with spinal or any trouble before the accident, but that after the accident her spine was badly contracted and she walked bent over on one side, this was sufficient to establish the greater possibility that claimant’s spinal trouble was caused by the accident. Golay v. Stoddard, 60 Idaho 168, 89 P.2d 1002 (1939).
    The evidence in the cited case was not insufficient as failing to show whether the injury was sustained during working hours or not. Golay v. Stoddard, 60 Idaho 168, 89 P.2d 1002 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no evidence whatever that the deceased was conscious of any mishap, hazard or fortuitous occurrence, or misadventure from, or by reason of, which he sustained an injury, and there being no evidence of an accident resulting in an injury to the deceased, the evidence was insufficient to award compensation for typhoid fever, allegedly contracted by a laborer while cleaning an irrigation ditch containing waste matter. Hoffman v. Consumers Water Co., 61 Idaho 226, 99 P.2d 919 (1940).
       </p>

        The evidence established that deceased met with an industrial accident which precipitated injury in such magnitude as to cause his death, namely a coronary attack while driving a road roller. Laird v. State Hwy. Dep’t, 80 Idaho 12, 323 P.2d 1079 (1958).

        The record was barren of any evidence tending to establish that claimant’s disability, encephalitis, resulted from an “accident” within the meaning of the workmen’s compensation law. Davenport v. Big Tom Breeder Farms, Inc., 85 Idaho 604, 382 P.2d 762 (1963).

        Where the parties stipulated that hearing before the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] should be held in another state, on appeal, the evidence of witness examined in such other state was treated as a stipulation by the parties that if the witnesses were called and legally sworn to testify, they would make the same statements as they did when purporting to testify in such foreign state.

        Where the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] had acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter and parties, the effect of the stipulation of parties respecting the taking of evidence without the state by the board amounted to a waiver of official or binding oath, and the taking of statements from witnesses on the cross-examination did not affect the board’s jurisdiction.

        Where the parties failed to produce satisfactory evidence upon any question material and necessary to a decision, it became the duty of the board to make full and exhaustive inquiry and it might examine any witness at the conclusion of his direct or cross-examination and it might also subpoena and examine other competent witnesses.

    The board was an administrative and fact-finding body, exercising special judicial functions, and as such, it is its duty to ascertain and produce, or cause to be produced, all available, competent and material evidence concerning any and all claims presented to it for consideration and allowance.

        Board had the power to investigate, to examine witnesses, and to call a matter for hearing, however, statute relating to board’s power to call hearing was not mandatory and stated that the board “may” call for a hearing, so that the filing of a claim with board and filing of petition for hearing were duties of employee.

        Where three doctors testified positively that there was no connection between the accident and a cancer producing an employee’s death, which evidence was opposed by the testimony of one doctor, and the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] found in accordance with the evidence of the three doctors, such finding would not be disturbed on appeal. Smith v. White Pine Lumber Co., 53 Idaho 808, 27 P.2d 965 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a claimant had failed or overlooked submitting evidence to establish the amount of compensation to which he was entitled, and there was no question but that he was entitled to compensation, then it was the duty of the board to call attention to such failure and see to it that whatever evidence was available to establish such fact was presented, and then make the necessary findings of fact. Feuling v. Farmers’ Co-op. Ditch Co., 54 Idaho 326, 31 P.2d 683 (1934); Watkins v. Cavanagh, 61 Idaho 720, 107 P.2d 155 (1940).

        Where the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] found that an employee met his death by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, this constituted but an ultimate conclusion of both law and fact and was insufficient upon which to base an award, unless sufficient specific facts were found. In re MacKenzie, 54 Idaho 481, 33 P.2d 113 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fragmentary and negative items of testimony were not sufficient to defeat the recovery of compensation, neither was such evidence sufficient to constitute a substantial conflict in the testimony making board’s findings conclusive.

Nistad v. Winton Lumber Co., 59 Idaho 533, 85 P.2d 236 (1938).
    Where the board failed to make a finding, in order to properly enter an order awarding compensation, or denying it, the case would be remanded to the board to make specific findings to supply those lacking. Smith v. Mercy Hosp., 60 Idaho 674, 95 P.2d 580 (1939).

        The industrial accident board’s [now industrial commission] finding that the compensation claimant on a certain date commenced working for a named company and “had worked there ever since,” earning specified daily wages, although ambiguous, would not be disturbed by the supreme court nor the cause remanded with directions to the board to find specifically in conformity with the fact that the claimant, after injury, had not returned to his usual occupation and work, and that he only worked about one-half of the time.

       <p>
        A finding by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] that an employee’s death was the result of an accidental fall in the course of his employment, and that his work simply augmented the injury, was supported by competent evidence and was sufficient to support an award of compensation for his death.

       </p>
       <p>
        The decision of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was final, from which an appeal lay to the supreme court (formerly district court) and which had to be taken within 30 days after a copy thereof had been sent to the parties, and there was no provision of the law requiring a petition for review where the matter was heard before the whole board and not a member thereof. Fields v. Buffalo-Idaho Mining Co., 55 Idaho 212, 40 P.2d 114 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Board had jurisdiction from commencement of proceeding until an appeal was taken or time for appeal had expired, during which time the board might and on proper showing should rehear the case and take additional testimony. Dehlin v. Shuck, 63 Idaho 620, 124 P.2d 244 (1942).

        Members of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] were the triers of the facts — the final judges of the weight and credibility to be given the opinion of experts hypothetically stated. Stralovich v. Sunshine Mining Co., 68 Idaho 524, 201 P.2d 106 (1948).

        Because a claimant stated, in his report to the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], that a splinter entered his eye while he was prying the fender brace of an automobile in place, and at the hearing he testified he did not know just how the accident happened, whether the splinter flew up into his face, or whether he fell against the fender stick, was insufficient to authorize the board in denying him compensation on the ground that the two statements were diametrically opposed. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance between claim for workmen’s compensation and proof did not warrant denial of an award. Nistad v. Winton Lumber Co., 61 Idaho 1, 99 P.2d 52 (1939).
    The theory upon which a claimant proceeds was immaterial; if the evidentiary facts entitled him to relief, such relief would be granted. Goaslind v. Pocatello, 61 Idaho 435, 102 P.2d 650 (1940); Zapantis v. Central Idaho Mining & Milling Co., 64 Idaho 498, 136 P.2d 154 (1943); Herman v. Sunset Mercantile Co., 66 Idaho 47, 154 P.2d 487 (1944).

        Once the industrial commission determined that its order had been disobeyed, the commission was required to certify the facts to the district court for contempt proceedings, and the district court then has the discretion to determine whether a contempt sanction is warranted under the facts as certified by the commission.

        Idaho industrial commission did not err in refusing to certify a witness’s refusal to the district court for contempt proceedings, where the witness was not living in the state and was apparently too sick to attend the deposition, offered to supply a telephonic deposition, and the record did not indicate that the witness was ever contacted by the employee for a telephonic deposition or to reschedule.

       <p>
        A lump sum settlement agreement constitutes a final decision of the industrial commission which is subject to a motion for reconsideration or rehearing under the provisions of this section. Davidson v. H.H. Keim Co., 110 Idaho 758, 718 P.2d 1196 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A lump sum worker’s compensation agreement was not set aside where it was signed by the claimant, approved by the commission, no rehearing or reconsideration was requested within twenty days, and there was no showing of fraud. Sadiku v. Aatronics Inc., 142 Idaho 410, 128 P.3d 947 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a lump sum compensation agreement is approved by the commission, that agreement becomes an award and is final and may not be reopened or set aside absent allegations and proof of fraud. Morris v. Hap Taylor & Sons, Inc., 154 Idaho 633, 301 P.3d 639 (2013).

        Matters Actually Adjudicated.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature, by adding the phrase “as to all matters adjudicated” when they enacted this section in 1971, intended that decisions of the commission be final and conclusive only as to those matters actually adjudicated; this is a departure from the concept of pure res judicata, applied prior to 1971, which accorded decisions by the commission finality and conclusiveness as to all matters which were, or could have been, adjudicated. Therefore, a compensation agreement approved by the commission was only final and conclusive as to those matters actually considered by the commission. Woodvine v. Triangle Dairy, Inc., 106 Idaho 716, 682 P.2d 1263 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A compensation agreement is res judicata only with respect to matters already decided by that agreement; since the compensation agreement between the claimant and the employer did not determine the retraining benefits, it could not be considered res judicata with respect to any new awards. Kindred v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 114 Idaho 284, 756 P.2d 401 (1988).

       <p>
        Where agreement between claimant and the industrial special indemnity fund stated that claimant would be paid monthly benefits at the statutory rate and recited claimant’s hourly wage at $5.06 per hour, and furthermore, the agreement explicitly stated that “no portion is a mere recital,” the industrial commission correctly determined that the hourly wage recited in the agreement was the base rate to be used in computing claimant’s average weekly wage; if claimant believed that his hourly wage was something other than the $5.06 amount, the time to have raised this issue was during the settlement process or by way of a motion for rehearing or reconsideration. Drake v. State, Indus. Special Indemnity Fund, 128 Idaho 880, 920 P.2d 397 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any party could move for reconsideration or rehearing of a decision, but it did not obligate the Idaho industrial commission to grant such requests, and although the claimant presented a very detailed brief in support of her motion for reconsideration or rehearing, she did not produce new law or evidence to necessitate a rehearing or reconsideration. Curtis v. M. H. King Co., 142 Idaho 383, 128 P.3d 920 (2005).
    In a workers’ compensation case, the Idaho industrial commission erred when it failed to hear a motion to reconsider due to alleged untimeliness because the motion was timely filed; the 20th day after the decision was July 4th, which was a holiday. Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., 145 Idaho 302, 179 P.3d 265 (2008).

        The terms “file” and “make” as used in this section have different meanings; therefore, motions to set aside the award and to reconsider must be made, not filed, within 20 days in order to be valid. Wright v. Willer, 111 Idaho 474, 725 P.2d 179 (1986).

        Where the industrial commission approved an agreement between the claimant and the employer’s surety, to which the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) was not a party, only the employee and the employer and his surety could rely upon the finality of that award under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-711" target="_self">§ 72-711 </a></cite>and this section; thus, the ISIF could not claim that approval of the compensation agreement foreclosed proceedings against it.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the claimant expressed his desire for a lump sum settlement and even after the settlement was initially rejected by the industrial commission, claimant still maintained that he wanted the agreement approved, the industrial commission correctly held that claimant’s allegations of manifest injustice were insufficient, even if proven, to permit the commission to set aside the lump sum compensation agreement.

       <p>
        A compensation agreement between a workmen’s compensation claimant and the state insurance fund which clearly provided for an award of disability, and which was approved by the industrial commission, became an “award” which, under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-711" target="_self">§ 72-711 </a></cite>and this section was final and conclusive as to claimant’s disability and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-706" target="_self">§ 72-706 </a></cite>had no application to it; modifications to the agreement were governed by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-719" target="_self">§ 72-719 </a></cite>and the agreement could not be modified because claimant’s application for modification was not filed within 5 years of the date of the injury, even though the application was filed within one year of payment of medical benefits.

       <p>
        Whenever the industrial commission explicitly retains jurisdiction over a matter, that act by its very nature infers that there is neither a final determination of the case nor a final permanent award to the employee. Reynolds v. Browning Ferris Indus., 113 Idaho 965, 751 P.2d 113 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a situation where the claimant’s impairment is progressive and, therefore, cannot adequately be determined for purposes of establishing a permanent disability rating, it is entirely appropriate for the industrial commission to retain jurisdiction until such time as the claimant’s condition is nonprogressive. Or, under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-425" target="_self">§ 72-425</a></cite>, the commission may instead estimate a claimant’s probable future disability and reduce it to present value for the purpose of making a final award which takes into account probable future changes in impairment. Either option is dependent upon a factual finding that the claimant’s impairment is progressive. Davidson v. Riverland Excavating, Inc., 147 Idaho 339, 209 P.3d 636 (2009).

        The decision of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was final, from which an appeal lay to the supreme court and which had to be taken within 30 days after a copy thereof had been sent to the parties, and there was no provision of the law requiring a petition for review where the matter was heard before the whole board and not a member thereof.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where parties entered into a compensation agreement, which settlement was approved by the board, making of agreement constituted an admission by the employer and surety, as equivalent to finding of fact by the board that claimant was engaged in covered employment, and since no appeal was taken from order of the board affirming the settlement, such award was res adjudicata on question as to whether claimant was engaged in covered employment at time of the accident.

        When a claimant applies for modification of an award due to a change in condition, the claimant bears the burden of showing a change in condition. The claimant is required to make a showing before the commission that he had an increased level of impairment, and he must establish with reasonable medical probability the existence of a causal relationship between the change in condition and the initial accident and injury.

        Substantial evidence supported a change of condition relative to worker’s shoulder injury resulting in an increase in her permanent physical impairment rating from 15% to 30% where doctor’s file memoranda established that worker’s worsened shoulder condition was directly related to her industrial injury and where commission chose to rely on another doctor’s 30% impairment rating.

        Where the commission did not make specific findings to support its conclusion that manifest injustice was not shown, but instead based its decision on the referee’s recommendation, the supreme court was unable to review the issue adequately and therefore, the cause would be remanded to the commission to review their decision and to make specific findings in order that the supreme court could properly review the issue.

        Whenever the industrial commission explicitly retains jurisdiction over a matter, that act by its very nature infers that there is neither a final determination of the case nor a final permanent award to the employee. Reynolds v. Browning Ferris Indus., 113 Idaho 965, 751 P.2d 113 (1988).

       <p>
        Subsection (3) of this section does not give the industrial commission the authority to rescind a prior order that has become final and conclusive for all purposes once the time for appeal has expired under the employment security law. Although subsection (3) of this section, part of Idaho’s comprehensive worker’s compensation law, provides for correction due to manifest injustice, there is no corresponding statute under Idaho’s employment security law.

        Where the industrial commission in its findings of fact and conclusions dealt only with the issue of whether the industrial accident aggravated the claimant’s preexisting condition, the commission should have also made the first determination, i.e., did the claimant’s total and permanent disability arise by reason of the combined effects of both the preexisting impairment (multiple sclerosis) and the subsequent injury sustained in the industrial accident, since if that determination had been made, it may very well have also followed that the initial award was a manifest injustice. Sines v. Appel, 103 Idaho 9, 644 P.2d 331 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the claimant received workman’s compensation of 17 1/2% of the whole man for an accident sustained while hauling timber, but the industrial commission failed to consider the extent to which the claimant’s preexisting illness, multiple sclerosis, affected the commission’s determination, the proceedings had to be remanded so that the commission could determine the liability, if any, of the Idaho special indemnity fund. Sines v. Appel, 103 Idaho 9, 644 P.2d 331 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant cannot prove permanent disability by changing his residence. Thus, the commission must consider the job market at the new residence and at the claimant’s residence at the time of the injury. Magee v. Thompson Creek Mining Co., 152 Idaho 196, 268 P.3d 464 (2012).

        Grounds for Modification Awards.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Prior to 1971 the only basis for a modification of an award was on the ground of a change in condition, however, now modification of awards may be made on the following grounds: (a) change in the nature of extent of the employee’s injury or disablement; or (b) fraud, and the commission, on its own motion may review a case in order to correct a manifest injustice. Frank v. Bunker Hill Co., 117 Idaho 790, 792 P.2d 815 (1988).
    As the industrial commission correctly opined, the fact that claimant settled for a disability award based on twenty percent of the whole man, which is equal to his permanent impairment rating, did not indicate that he has been treated unfairly; whether a claimant has suffered a permanent disability greater than permanent physical impairment is determined by assessing whether the physical impairment, taken in conjunction with non-medical factors [in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-430" target="_self">§ 72-430</a></cite>], has reduced the claimant’s capacity for gainful activity; the commission noted that at the time of the hearing in December 1988, claimant was employed at a higher hourly wage than he received in the same position prior to the 1985 accidental injury, and therefore did not have a reduced capacity to engage in gainful activity. Matthews v. Department of Cors., 121 Idaho 680, 827 P.2d 693 (1992).

       <p>
        Res judicata prevents only the relitigation of matters finally decided in an earlier decision of the commission; thus where commission approved agreement stating that claimant was 15 percent disabled and at hearing to reopen agreement on ground of change in condition, uncontradicted evidence established that she was 100 percent disabled whereupon commission ruled that claimant had not established fraud or change of condition but did not specifically rule on the applicability of the issue of manifest injustice stating that the agreement was res judicata, the court reversed and remanded the case so that commission could consider whether the agreement should be changed to correct a manifest injustice. Banzhaf v. Carnation Co., 104 Idaho 700, 662 P.2d 1144 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (3) of this section becomes operative on the commission’s own motion, but that fact does not preclude the commission from exercising its powers when notice of a purported manifest injustice is brought to its attention either by a party or a third party. Banzhaf v. Carnation Co., 104 Idaho 700, 662 P.2d 1144 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers’ compensation case, the Idaho industrial commission should have corrected a manifest injustice where a doctor subsequently stated that a benefits claimant had not achieved medical stability as of a certain date. It was later discovered that the doctor had not examined the claimant on the date in question; she failed to show up for her appointment, but later obtained more medical treatment. Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., 145 Idaho 302, 179 P.3d 265 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers’ compensation claimant was not entitled to reopen the hearing on the ground of manifest injustice under this section, because the Idaho industrial commission, in reaching its decision that his claim was untimely, did not rely upon any finding that related to the statements that the claimant now alleges to have been misunderstood.

       <p>
        In a situation where the claimant’s impairment is progressive and, therefore, cannot adequately be determined for purposes of establishing a permanent disability rating, it is entirely appropriate for the industrial commission to retain jurisdiction until such time as the claimant’s condition is nonprogressive. Reynolds v. Browning Ferris Indus., 113 Idaho 965, 751 P.2d 113 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the industrial commission’s order contained a detailed analysis of all factors necessary for a determination of entitlement to temporary total disability benefits, but did not expressly grant claimant’s request for those income benefits, the order was not considered to be equivalent to an order denying benefits as such a construction would be contrary to both the spirit and intent of the workers’ compensation act and would be inconsistent with the commission’s clear and unambiguous order reserving or retaining jurisdiction on the issue of future changes in claimant’s condition.

       </h5>
       <p>
        An agreement entered into between the parties and approved by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] [now industrial commission] was res judicata, and in the absence of a change in conditions, the board might not, on an application thereafter, hear the matter de novo, neither might it vacate or otherwise modify an award in the absence of a change in conditions. Zapantis v. Central Idaho Mining & Milling Co., 61 Idaho 660, 106 P.2d 113 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        The compromise settlement of a claim did not preclude the claimant from seeking modification of such settlement upon the happening of a second accident to the disability from which the first accident was claimed to have contributed. Dawson v. Hartwick, 91 Idaho 561, 428 P.2d 480 (1967).

        Burden of Proof.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the state insurance fund or other insurance carrier recognized a hernia as compensable and paid therefor until it was evidently considered that the employee had recovered from the operation, this was not such an acknowledgment of liability for, or recognition of, the subsequent condition of the employee as having arisen from or having been caused by the operation for the hernia, as to cast upon the insurance carrier the burden of proving that it was entitled to cease payments. Carlson v. F. H. DeAtley & Co., 55 Idaho 713, 46 P.2d 1089 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an application was made for a modification of an award, the burden was on the moving party to show a change in condition. Boshers v. Payne, 58 Idaho 109, 70 P.2d 391 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proof rested on the party who sought an order by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] declaring a change in conditions arising from an injury sustained by the claimant, and where there was no change in condition, the board could not rehear a case on its merits and determine under the evidence that the claimant was totally disabled, and had been since his injury, and make an award increasing his weekly compensation. Fackenthall v. Eggers Pole & Supply Co., 62 Idaho 46, 108 P.2d 300 (1940).
    The burden was on a party claiming a change of conditions to prove the change and that such change was due to a prior compensable accident, so where a claimant had been awarded total temporary disability compensation for electrical burns, to entitle the claimant to additional compensation on the ground of a subsequent change in condition, the burden was upon the claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the shock caused his alleged changed condition. Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 65 Idaho 339, 144 P.2d 210 (1943).

        Change in Condition.
       </h5>
       <p>
        On petition of defendants, cessation of payments was approved upon showing that claimant’s total disability for work had changed to partial with use of corrective glasses, but claimant was held entitled to specific indemnity for physical impairment determined without use of corrective glasses. Kelley v. Prouty, 54 Idaho 225, 30 P.2d 769 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Question whether an injury in a second accident was a recurrence of a prior compensated injury was one of proximate cause. If condition on second injury was proximately caused by first accident, first employer is liable, but claimant should proceed under the statute. Patrick v. Smith Baking Co., 64 Idaho 190, 129 P.2d 651 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test of a “change of condition” was a disability variably continuing, progressively healing or eventually ceasing, not being a fixed definite loss subject to specific indemnity. Mahoney v. Payette, 64 Idaho 443, 133 P.2d 927 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] refrained from determining the amount of claimant’s permanent physical impairment until his condition should become fixed, definite and determinable even when said board found disability had increased since making the compensation agreement, such claimant was entitled to an award based upon his changed physical impairment. McCall v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 67 Idaho 415, 182 P.2d 156 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where appellant after injury was unable to perform the duties of a logger but for two years past had driven a gravel truck, he was not totally disabled. McCall v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 67 Idaho 415, 182 P.2d 156 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where board at original hearing found claimant had suffered disability equivalent to 50 per cent of loss of arm at the shoulder, and on rehearing there was evidence that permanent partial disability was no greater, this was not conclusive on question as to whether claimant had a recurrence which would entitle him to further relief under the act. Koegler v. C.F. Davidson Co., 69 Idaho 416, 209 P.2d 728 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Board erred in dismissing claimant’s petition for further medical treatment, where evidence showed that change in applicant’s condition required further medical treatment. Koegler v. C.F. Davidson Co., 69 Idaho 416, 209 P.2d 728 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant filed a petition on January 5, 1948 for modification of award on ground that disability was increasing, board did not err in setting petition for hearing on February 3, 1950, since board could not indefinitely postpone hearing. Egus v. Triumph Mining Co., 71 Idaho 354, 232 P.2d 136 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employer entered into an agreement for payment of total temporary disability for loss of time and for payment of permanent partial disability for loss of leg such agreement was equivalent to factual finding of the board and was final and conclusive, but it did not bar the board in subsequent modification proceeding from finding total permanent disability or finding a greater degree of permanent partial disability based on changed conditions. Nitkey v. Bunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Co., 73 Idaho 294, 251 P.2d 216 (1952).
    Board properly denied further compensation to petitioner against employer and its carrier where there was no change in condition of petitioner, and no attempt to set aside prior compensation agreement or to claim compensation from employer. Anderson v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 77 Idaho 263, 291 P.2d 859 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] properly ruled that the limitation period for the making of an application for an award on the ground of change of conditions was not applicable because in this case no agreement or award had been made or entered. Lindskog v. Rosebud Mines, Inc., 84 Idaho 160, 369 P.2d 580 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the change as to the disability of the injured employee which authorized the modification of an award or agreement. The attendance was required to be furnished “immediately after an injury, and for a reasonable time thereafter.” Clevenger v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 85 Idaho 193, 377 P.2d 794 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was proper for board to treat petitions for rehearing after award by whole board as a petition for modification based on a change in condition, despite denial by claimant of such a change, where claimant’s petitions alleged a change in condition and did not allege that board failed to make its finding based on all the evidence available at the time, and where later petition was filed more than six months after the original award. Scott v. Aslett Constr. Co., 92 Idaho 834, 452 P.2d 61 (1969), overruled on other grounds, Christensen v. Calico Constr. & Dev. Co., 97 Idaho 327, 543 P.2d 1167 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Modification of an award may have been made on the basis of a change in condition although the claimant was not gainfully employed at the time he underwent the change in condition. Johnson v. Boise Cascade Corp., 93 Idaho 107, 456 P.2d 751 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of industrial accident board [now industrial commission] that claimant’s back injury of December 4, 1968, while employed by last employer, was an aggravation of a previous back injury of February 14, 1968, while working for previous employer, was upheld where the compensation agreement between previous employer and claimant was by its terms subject to the statute and where there was substantial, though conflicting, evidence to support the board’s findings. Earl v. Swift & Co., 93 Idaho 546, 467 P.2d 589 (1970).

        A mistake entering into an agreement between the parties for compensation, which was approved by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], may not have been modified or corrected thereafter, since the statute only authorized the modification on the showing of a change in condition. Reagan v. Baxter Foundry & Mach. Works, 53 Idaho 722, 27 P.2d 62 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        On application for an increased award, the board was restricted to a consideration of conditions arising after the former award. Mell v. Larson, 54 Idaho 754, 36 P.2d 250 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        From a careful survey of the authorities, it was apparent that a hearing on changed conditions was limited to a modification of the award solely on that ground, and no other errors might be corrected in the instance of either party. Barry v. Peterson Motor Co., 55 Idaho 702, 46 P.2d 77 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application might not serve the purpose of an appeal, by presenting errors in original determination, but only presented question of modification by reason of a change in condition. Boshers v. Payne, 58 Idaho 109, 70 P.2d 391 (1937).

       <p>
        Whether letter of claimant with amendment by his attorney was sufficient to constitute an application for further compensation was not passed upon on appeal, if no appeal was taken from affirmative ruling of the board. Koegler v. C.F. Davidson Co., 69 Idaho 416, 209 P.2d 728 (1949). Constitutionality.
       </p>
       <p>
        The contention that the section relating modification of awards and agreements was unconstitutional in that it was a special law, prohibited by Idaho Const., Art. III, § 19 was incorrect as the section was general in terms, all persons subject to it were treated alike as to privileges, protection, and in every other respect. Wanke v. Ziebarth Constr. Co., 69 Idaho 64, 202 P.2d 384 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions limiting the making of an application to four years, but not oftener than once in six months did not limit the remedy so given to any single person or group of persons, therefore it was not unconstitutional as making any classification whatsoever. Wanke v. Ziebarth Constr. Co., 69 Idaho 64, 202 P.2d 384 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any defects or imperfections in the statute as originally enacted in 1917, if any there were, in allowing an injured employee to recover compensation and recoupment for medical expenses after four years, would be cured by the reenactment thereof in 1931 and would be sufficient to negative any contentions that such section was invalid. Wanke v. Ziebarth Constr. Co., 69 Idaho 64, 202 P.2d 384 (1948).

        While the furnishing to the injured employee of medical, surgical, or hospital services and other attendance or treatment might be treated as payment of compensation, such was not the subject of an agreement or an award which was contemplated by the statute, as being subject to modification on the ground of a change in conditions.

        A “change of condition” was not a sufficient ground for setting aside a lump sum settlement since the effect of the statute providing for lump sum payments was to make a lump sum settlement final and not subject to review. Fountain v. T.Y. & Jim Hom, 92 Idaho 928, 453 P.2d 577 (1969). Place of Hearing.

        Where a claimant was compensated for an injury to his elbow, but subsequently reinjured the elbow and contracted degenerative arthritis requiring corrective surgery, this section did not bar compensation for medical and surgical expenses despite a lapse of four years and 10 months between the first injury and notice to the employer of the second compensation claim.

       <p>
        Where the sole question for determination was whether or not there was sufficient evidence in the record on appeal to sustain the board’s findings and conclusions, that an employee’s present disability did not result from a hernia or operation therefor, the appellate court might look only to the testimony of the second hearing where the employer or insurance carrier offered the testimony taken at the first hearing but which was excluded by the board upon the employee’s objection.

        Where final payment of award was received about August 8 and claimant on October 19 filed petition to reopen award on ground that he was then suffering from a traumatic psychosis, commission had not lost jurisdiction, and right to apply for readjustment had not then expired.

        The statute limiting the time for filing an application to within four years of the date of the accident causing the injury complained of was not retroactive. Wanke v. Ziebarth Constr. Co., 69 Idaho 64, 202 P.2d 384 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the board might have erred in making an award of permanent partial disability instead of permanent total disability, claimant should have appealed, and a subsequent application more than four years after the accident for modification of the award was too late. Wanke v. Ziebarth Constr. Co., 69 Idaho 64, 202 P.2d 384 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant filed petition for modification of award within four-year period, board did not err in setting hearing on petition for hearing filed by employer more than four years after accident, since petition for hearing was not an original petition to review award. Egus v. Triumph Mining Co., 71 Idaho 354, 232 P.2d 136 (1951).

       <p>
        Claim against second injury fund was timely where letter mailed to board seeking additional compensation was received within four years of date of accident though amended petition was not filed within four-year period, since petition reverted back to date of filing of original letter. Anderson v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 77 Idaho 263, 291 P.2d 859 (1955).

       <p>
        While statutes providing for time and manner for relief on claims and modifications of awards and agreements by reference in the section relating to filing of claims made a part of the firemen’s retirement act, the board did not rule that either section of such statutes would bar widow’s claim that should not come into existence until death of employee and she had perfected her pending appeal within the time limit specified. Branson v. Firemen’s Retirement Fund, 79 Idaho 167, 312 P.2d 1037 (1957); Zimmerman v. Harris Lumber Co., 82 Idaho 187, 350 P.2d 746 (1960).

        If the findings of fact of the industrial commission are supported by substantial competent evidence, they will not be disturbed by the court on appeal. Levesque v. Hi-Boy Meats, Inc., 95 Idaho 808, 520 P.2d 549 (1974); Bills v. Rich Motor Co., 96 Idaho 259, 526 P.2d 1095 (1974); Gradwohl v. J.R. Simplot Co., 96 Idaho 655, 534 P.2d 775 (1975); Dean v.

        Whether the findings of the commission are based on substantial competent evidence is a determination to be made by the court on appeal. Gradwohl v. J.R. Simplot Co., 96 Idaho 655, 534 P.2d 775 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the commission’s finding that a claimant had left his employment voluntarily without good cause was supported by substantial competent evidence, its conclusion that the claimant was ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits would not be reversed on claimant’s contention that the decision was based upon improperly admitted evidence. Nenoff v. Culligan Soft Water, 97 Idaho 243, 542 P.2d 837 (1975).
    The supreme court will not substitute its views of the facts for the findings of fact made by the industrial commission if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. Troutner v. Traffic Control Co., 97 Idaho 525, 547 P.2d 1130 (1976).

        Referee’s order denying motion to compel discovery was not a final decision of the commission; therefore, there was no right to appeal from the referee’s order. Peterson v. Farmore Pump & Irrigation, 119 Idaho 969, 812 P.2d 276 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant could not appeal referee’s denial of his request to reopen his workers’ compensation case because the industrial commission did not approve and confirm the denial; order was not appealable because it was not an order of the commission, but only of the referee. Section 72-718 provides a procedure by which a party may seek a ruling by the commission on a matter decided by a referee that was not confirmed or approved by the commission in its approval, confirmation, and adoption of the referee’s findings and conclusions.

        The commission did not adopt, approve, or confirm the referee’s ruling on the admissibility of the testimony of the witness. The Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Proposed Order contained no reference to the referee’s decision regarding the testimony of the witness, nor did the record indicate that the plaintiff sought, at any time, to bring the ruling to the commission’s attention, either by filing a motion to reconsider or by arguing the issue in a post-hearing briefing. In this case, the commission did not specifically approve or adopt the referee’s ruling, and it was not a final appealable order pursuant to Idaho App. R. 11(d). Dehlbom v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 129 Idaho 579, 930 P.2d 1021 (1997). Findings of Board.

        In hearings on claimant’s application for full income benefits as surviving widow of employee who was killed when his semi-truck overturned, the commission did not err in its conclusion that there was a lack of substantial evidence in the record that employee’s death was caused by intoxication, even though test results revealed that decedent had .117 percent blood alcohol level, where truck stop proprietors testified that employee’s behavior was normal and that he did not appear to be intoxicated.

        Idaho App. R. 17(e)(1)(A) might be construed to allow the supreme court to consider a referee’s order denying a motion to compel discovery; to do so, however, would expand the statutory right of appeal specified by the legislature in this section to include orders that were not orders of the commission, and is beyond the court’s authority to do so.

        Where the claimant’s deceased husband controlled a substantial portion of the method and manner of the harvest and the testimony which indicates the farmer with whom he had contracted only envisioned exercising limited control, if necessary, to ensure satisfactory results, there is no substantial, competent evidence in the record to support the industrial commission’s finding that the farmer had the right to control all activities of the deceased.

        Where an orthopedic surgeon gave expert medical testimony that based on his examination of the claimant and the results of an arthoscopy exam of the claimant’s knee, it was his opinion that the claimant had a permanent physical impairment equivalent to ten percent as compared to the loss of the leg at the hip, but that the disability should not prevent the claimant from returning to his former vocation as a diesel mechanic, such testimony constituted substantial competent evidence supporting the commission’s finding of fact that the claimant suffered a permanent partial disability of ten percent loss of the leg at the hip.

       <p>
        The commission’s finding that claimant failed to give timely notice of his accident to the employer was correct, where the record indicated that the employer did not learn that claimant was claiming a work-related accident until some time after June 7, approximately four months after the date of the accident, and where prior to that time claimant had not filed an accident report with his employer, even though his position as warehouse foreman required him to participate in and become familiar with the plant’s safety program, including its policy of reporting every accident regardless of how minor it might be.

       <p>
        Under the constitutional amendment and cognate legislation, in respect to the same such matter, appeals from an order of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] lie directly to the supreme court, instead of to the district court as theretofore. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937).

        Appeal or Review.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The decision of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was final, from which an appeal lay to the supreme court (formerly district court) and which had to be taken within 30 days after a copy thereof had been sent to the parties, and there was no provision of the law requiring a petition for review where the matter was heard before the whole board and not a member thereof. Fields v. Buffalo-Idaho Mining Co., 55 Idaho 212, 40 P.2d 114 (1935).
    Though evidence before the board was such that reasonable minds might differ upon the issue presented, if there was evidence of a substantial nature which supported decision of the board, the decision would not be reversed on appeal. Johansen v. Ferry-Morse Seed Co., 69 Idaho 275, 206 P.2d 545 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employer entered into an agreement for payment of total temporary disability for loss of time and for payment of permanent partial disability for loss of leg such agreement was equivalent to factual finding of the board and was final and conclusive, but it did not bar the board in subsequent modification proceeding from finding total permanent disability or finding a greater degree of permanent partial disability based on changed conditions. Nitkey v. Bunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Co., 73 Idaho 294, 251 P.2d 216 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court in reviewing action of industrial accident board [now industrial commission] would only determine whether findings of board were supported by competent and substantial evidence. Smith v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 74 Idaho 470, 264 P.2d 684 (1953); Yanzick v. Sunset Minerals, Inc., 75 Idaho 384, 272 P.2d 696 (1954).

       </p>
       <p>
        A compensation agreement and lump settlement thereon approved by the board became final and conclusive when no appeal from award was made within 30 days and employee could not thereafter attack the award on the ground of fraud. Limprecht v. Bybee, 76 Idaho 293, 281 P.2d 1047 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was the arbiter of conflicting evidence present in a claim under the workmen’s compensation law, and if the board’s determination was supported by substantial competent evidence, it would not be disturbed on appeal.

        The finding of the board that claimant failed to prove more than a possibility that the injury to her husband contributed to or hastened death was conclusive, the claim being based upon the asserted ground that the injury sustained in the fall aggravated preexisting infirmities and thus contributed to and hastened death which was directly due to nephritis.

       </p>
       <p>
        An employer and surety, who relied upon the statute relating to preexisting infirmities to defeat a recovery of compensation for the aggravation of preexisting disease, were not prejudiced by the fact that the constitutionality of the statute was not raised before the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] and the question of constitutionality could be raised by the claimant for the first time on appeal. Cole v. Fruitland Canning Ass’n, 64 Idaho 505, 134 P.2d 603 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of constitutionality was a judicial problem that only the courts had power to decide, therefore since it was not a proper question for determination by an administrative board, it might be raised for the first time on appeal, when no prejudice would be suffered by an adverse party. Wanke v. Ziebarth Constr. Co., 69 Idaho 64, 202 P.2d 384 (1948).

       </p>
       <p>
        Unless an appeal was timely filed, decision of the board was final, except for modification. Eldridge v. Idaho State Penitentiary, 54 Idaho 213, 30 P.2d 781 (1934); Fields v. Buffalo-Idaho Mining Co., 55 Idaho 212, 40 P.2d 114 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        An injured employee’s claim for additional compensation after a cessation of payments under an alleged summary award was barred by statute of limitations in the absence of an appeal therefrom within 30 days. Eldridge v. Idaho State Penitentiary, 54 Idaho 213, 30 P.2d 781 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an award has become final by failure to appeal a hearing because of changed conditions was limited to a modification of the award solely on that ground and no errors might be corrected by either party. Barry v. Peterson Motor Co., 55 Idaho 702, 46 P.2d 77 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] made an award based upon the recommendation of the medical adviser to the manager of the state insurance fund, and compensation was paid thereunder without dissent or complaint, the board under these circumstances had jurisdiction to make an order, and where the employee knew of the nature of the order under which he received compensation, such order was not subject to an assailment on any ground of irregularity after a lapse of 20 years. McGarrigle v. Grangeville Elec. Light & Power Co., 60 Idaho 690, 97 P.2d 402 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        An appeal lay from an award predicated upon an agreement between the claimant, the employer and his insurance carrier, and which was approved by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission]; it had all of the incidents of an award made on a contested hearing in the absence of fraud; it might be reviewed or it might be modified on the ground of a change in conditions. Zapantis v. Central Idaho Mining & Milling Co., 61 Idaho 660, 106 P.2d 113 (1940).
    The workmen’s compensation act provision making the judgment of the district court respecting the enforcement of a workmen’s compensation award final, and prohibiting appeal therefrom, could not be evaded by the indirect method of appealing from an order denying a motion to set aside the nonappealable judgment entered pursuant to the terms of the workmen’s compensation act and prohibiting appeal therefrom. Haines v. State Ins. Fund, 65 Idaho 450, 145 P.2d 833 (1944).

        Insofar as the findings of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] reversed the determination of the examiners that claimant, a federal employee, resigned they were in error but the findings did support the conclusion that claimant resigned for good cause therefor since the final judgment or order of the lower tribunal was correct but entered upon an erroneous theory, the judgment or order would be confirmed by the appellate court upon the correct theory.

       <p>
        While the findings of a federal employing agency that claimant resigned might be final and conclusive as to reasons for the termination of service of claimant, it was necessary to determine whether claimant was entitled to unemployment compensation benefits under Idaho law, notwithstanding the fact that he resigned his position with the agency. Saulls v. Employment Sec. Agency, 85 Idaho 212, 377 P.2d 789 (1963).

        The findings of the federal agency as to an employee’s reason for termination of service had been held final and conclusive in state proceedings to determine entitlement of federal employees to unemployment compensation benefits; however, the findings of the federal employing agency were final and conclusive only with respect to matters enumerated in the statutes.

        In the presence of conflicting evidence in worker’s compensation proceedings, the supreme court has consistently recognized the industrial commission as the arbiter of those conflicting facts and has acknowledged that the weight to be accorded evidence is within the commission’s particular province.

        Where claimant had been paid in advance by the school district, where the local coach had the right to reject the claimant as an official through the rating system, and where the claimant had no control over the scheduling of the time and place for performance of his officiating duties, claimant therefore qualified as an “employee” of the school district for purposes of the workmen’s compensation statutes. Ford v. Bonner County Sch. Dist., 101 Idaho 320, 612 P.2d 557 (1980).

       <p>
        Whether a claimant is an employee or an independent contractor is a factual determination, and the supreme court will not overturn factual findings made by the industrial commission when those findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence, even if conflicting evidence exists. Kiele v. Steve Henderson Logging, 127 Idaho 681, 905 P.2d 82 (1995). Evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant appealed commission finding that there was no causal connection between the original industrial accident and claimant’s hypertension, competency of the evidence on which the commission had based its findings of fact was not affected by the fact that medical testimony before the commission was in the form of depositions. Gradwohl v. J.R. Simplot Co., 96 Idaho 655, 534 P.2d 775 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the commission’s finding that a claimant had left his employment voluntarily without good cause was supported by substantial competent evidence, its conclusion that the claimant was ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits would not be reversed on claimant’s contention that the decision was based upon improperly admitted evidence. Nenoff v. Culligan Soft Water, 97 Idaho 243, 542 P.2d 837 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court will not substitute its views of the facts for the findings of facts made by the industrial commission if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. Troutner v. Traffic Control Co., 97 Idaho 525, 547 P.2d 1130 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant was examined by five doctors following accident and none could state with probability that the pain was directly caused by the accident, and where claimant had previously been treated for upper back pain twice prior to the accident, the decision of the industrial commission denying claim for partial permanent disability was supported by substantial competent evidence under this section and supportable as a matter of law under<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. V, § 9.</cite> George v. American Smelting &amp; Ref. Co., 101 Idaho 781, 621 P.2d 397 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a greater number of witnesses supported a view different from the conclusion reached by the commission is of no moment in determining the preponderance of the evidence supporting the commission’s decision. Rather, the determination must be based on an assessment of the reliability, trustworthiness, and probative value of the evidence. Houser v. Southern Idaho Pipe & Steel, Inc., 103 Idaho 441, 649 P.2d 1197 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an orthopedic surgeon gave expert medical testimony that based on his examination of the claimant and the results of an arthoscopy exam of the claimant’s knee, it was his opinion that the claimant had a permanent physical impairment equivalent to ten percent as compared to the loss of the leg at the hip but that the disability should not prevent the claimant from returning to his former vocation as a diesel mechanic, such testimony constituted substantial competent evidence supporting the commission’s finding of fact that the claimant suffered a permanent partial disability of ten percent loss of the leg at the hip. Houser v. Southern Idaho Pipe & Steel, Inc., 103 Idaho 441, 649 P.2d 1197 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the industrial commission found that the claimant, who was living with the decedent at the time of his death but was not married to him, did not hold herself out as married, which finding was supported by substantial, competent evidence and supported the ultimate finding that there was no common-law marriage, appellate court would not disturb the commission’s order denying workmen’s compensation benefits to the claimant. Graham v. Larry Donohoe Logging, 103 Idaho 824, 654 P.2d 1377 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compensation is recoverable where an employee’s work causes an injury to the employee which results in violence to the physical structure of the body or causes an accident which aggravates or accelerates a previous disease condition of the employee, and an employee must establish his employment caused or contributed to his injury. Horner v. Ponderosa Pine Logging, 107 Idaho 1111, 695 P.2d 1250 (1985).
    Where the industrial commission found that while claimant’s pain may have been caused by his strenuous work, claimant’s heart attack, which occurred four days after claimant ceased working, was not caused by claimant’s work but was due to an accelerating coronary disease; since pain alone is not compensable (because it does not cause violence to the physical structure of the body) claimant was not entitled to worker’s compensation benefits. Horner v. Ponderosa Pine Logging, 107 Idaho 1111, 695 P.2d 1250 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court affirmed denial of unemployment benefits where the industrial commission’s final decision was that the statements which were made by the employer during a heated argument were not statements which would reasonably be interpreted as discharging the claimant. Porter v. Gem State Plumbing, 119 Idaho 54, 803 P.2d 555 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Continuing the policy of deferring to the credibility determination of the industrial commission, the supreme court of Idaho affirmed the commission’s finding that claimant’s fall did not cause or accelerate the claimant’s need for a hip replacement. Ross v. Tupperware Mfg. Company/Premark, 122 Idaho 641, 837 P.2d 316 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial commission determined that Boise orthopedic surgeon’s opinion that claimant’s fall did not cause the need for hip replacement was more persuasive than Utah orthopedic surgeon’s opinion that the injury was the cause. Ross v. Tupperware Mfg. Company/Premark, 122 Idaho 641, 837 P.2d 316 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Doctor’s testimony that worker’s compensation claimant’s symptoms were from a later non-work related injury and not from an earlier work related accident constituted substantial competent evidence to support denial of benefits. Monroe v. Chuck & Del’s, Inc., 123 Idaho 627, 851 P.2d 341 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commission’s finding of no permanent impairment was supported by substantial and competent evidence where commission considered numerous medical records from nearly a dozen physicians, found that claimant’s testimony lacked credibility, found that even doctor who assigned whole body impairment rating of 17%, based his rating in part on claimant’s subjective complaints of back pain and where commission gave particular weight to the records and opinions of doctor, who wrote as follows: “In my opinion this gentleman sustained a contusion-sprain to his back. He has been treated adequately, completely. His symptoms are overdetermined, there is not objective evidence of physical impairment from this alleged injury nor is there indication that he could not, on an objective basis, return to activity including that of his regular job.” Soto v. J.R. Simplot, 126 Idaho 536, 887 P.2d 1043 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        There must be medical testimony with a reasonable degree of medical probability to support a worker’s compensation claim. In this regard, “Probable” is defined as “having more evidence for than against.” Where hearsay evidence is admitted without objection in proceedings before the commission, it properly may be considered in determining the facts. Soto v. J.R. Simplot, 126 Idaho 536, 887 P.2d 1043 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record revealed two doctors’ work restrictions on December 28, 1989 and March 17, 1990, respectively, and nothing showing claimant’s condition improved in the interim, the referee’s conclusion that claimant was “mistakenly” restricted from work was not supported by the evidence, and thus, the denial of TTD benefits before March 17, 1990 was not supported by the evidence. Soto v. J.R. Simplot, 126 Idaho 536, 887 P.2d 1043 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial and competent evidence to support the industrial commission’s finding that claimant did not prove that he could not do the work that was attempted for while it was clear he could no longer lift packages, psychologist, physical therapist and physician determined that claimant could perform sedentary work under certain conditions. Wheaton v. Industrial Special Indem. Fund, 129 Idaho 538, 928 P.2d 42 (1996).
    The appellate court in review of commission decisions is limited to a determination of whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial and competent evidence; substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of proof, but less than a preponderance; it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion.

        Workers’ compensation claimant bears the burden of proving that an injury-causing accident occurred by proving that an unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap or untoward event took place, and where claimant’s injury was an aggravation of an existing knee injury sustained in 1987, claimant did not meet this burden and commission’s finding that he failed to prove the occurrence of a compensable accident within the meaning of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c01s72-102" target="_self">§ 72-102 </a></cite>was based on substantial and competent evidence and was not clearly erroneous.

        Where worker made a claim for occupational disease, the claimant had the burden of proving, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, a causal connection between the condition for which compensation was claimed and occupational exposure to the substance or conditions which caused the alleged condition, and although physician’s records indicated that claimant’s work environment may have irritated his asthma condition, none stated that his condition was related, to a reasonable degree of probability, to his work environment, thus the industrial commission’s conclusion denying compensation was supported by substantial and competent evidence and would not be disturbed on appeal.

        Worker’s compensation claimant carries the burden of proof that to a reasonable degree of medical probability the injury for which benefits are claimed is causally related to an accident occurring in the course of employment. Proof of a possible causal link is insufficient to satisfy the burden and the issue of causation must be proved by expert medical testimony. Trimble v. Engelking, 130 Idaho 300, 939 P.2d 1379 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission of the state of Idaho’s factual findings were upheld where the claimant had not met his burden of showing that his current complaints were related to the industrial accident, and that more than likely they were related to such things as degenerative arthritic conditions unrelated to the accident.

        The commission’s finding that claimant failed to give timely notice of his accident to the employer was correct, where the record indicated that the employer did not learn that claimant was claiming a work-related accident until some time after June 7, approximately four months after the date of the accident, and where prior to that time claimant had not filed an accident report with his employer, even though his position as warehouse foreman required him to participate in and become familiar with the plant’s safety program, including its policy of reporting every accident regardless of how minor it might be. Dick v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 100 Idaho 742, 605 P.2d 506 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of whether or not the claimant falls within the “odd-lot” classification is a factual one; such a determination of fact by the commission can be set aside only if not based on substantial competent evidence. Reifsteck v. Lantern Motel & Cafe, 101 Idaho 699, 619 P.2d 1152 (1980).
    Findings of fact made by the industrial commission are subject to limited appellate review, and the supreme court’s function is to determine whether the findings are supported by substantial, competent evidence. Hayes v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 104 Idaho 279, 658 P.2d 950 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the presence of conflicting evidence in workmen’s compensation proceedings, the supreme court continues to recognize the industrial commission as the arbiter, and acknowledge that the weight to be accorded evidence is within their particular province. Hayes v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 104 Idaho 279, 658 P.2d 950 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where uncontroverted evidence showed that claimant’s symptoms were caused by a ruptured disc which appeared prior to first surgery to remove fibrous tissue on spine, commission’s finding to the contrary must be reversed. Wynn v. J.R. Simplot Co., 105 Idaho 102, 666 P.2d 629 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The factual findings of the industrial commission will not be overturned on appeal unless they are unsupported by substantial and competent evidence; further, the industrial commission will be the arbiter of conflicting evidence. Nelson v. Pumnea, 106 Idaho 48, 675 P.2d 27 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record was devoid of any evidence upon which supreme court might sustain the commission’s finding as to the reason for the surety’s inaction on claimant’s application for hearing, the holding of the commission was unsupported as a matter of law and was reversed. Nelson v. Pumnea, 106 Idaho 48, 675 P.2d 27 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the commission found that the claimant was 55 years of age, had an eighth grade education, was considerably restricted in his movements and ambulation, was unable to use any of the skills he had acquired due to the injuries to his hip and back, and that he had sought employment unsuccessfully, there was substantial, competent evidence to support the commission’s determination, that claimant made a prima facie showing that he was an “odd-lot” worker. Neilson v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 106 Idaho 878, 684 P.2d 280 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where contested findings of the industrial commission are supported by substantial, competent evidence, those findings will not be disturbed on appeal; thus, although the evidence was conflicting as to whether claimant was an odd-lot worker, the commission’s findings in this matter were supported by substantial and competent evidence and would not be disturbed on appeal. Bell v. Clear Springs Trout Co., 107 Idaho 568, 691 P.2d 1183 (1984).

        Findings of fact made by the industrial commission are subject to limited appellate review; the court’s function is to determine whether the findings are supported by substantial, competent evidence. Lopez v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 107 Idaho 590, 691 P.2d 1205 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial commission did not err in its factual determination that claimant’s partial permanent disability was thirty-five percent of the whole man, even though the testifying physician assigned a sixty percent impairment, where the physician’s testimony was impeached by his own prior letters and records. Goicoechea v. Blincoe’s Magic Valley Packing Co., 108 Idaho 403, 700 P.2d 25 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court will not disturb findings of fact by the industrial commission when they are supported by competent, although conflicting, evidence; the supreme court may set aside the commission’s findings of fact only if the record is devoid of substantial competent evidence to support them. Thus, where the testimony demonstrated that the record was devoid of any substantial competent evidence to support the disability award of 50 percent of the whole man, reversal and remand were proper. Johnson v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 108 Idaho 765, 702 P.2d 803 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial commission’s determination that the death of claimant’s husband did not arise out of and in the course of his employment was proper where the commission’s findings that there was no employer tradition of an annual Christmas party, that the death occurred after decedent left a Christmas party arranged by a few employees and that the death occurred off of the employer’s premises were supported by substantial evidence. Snyder v. Burl C. Lange, Inc., 109 Idaho 167, 706 P.2d 56 (1985).
    The industrial commission’s findings of fact will not be disturbed if supported by competent, although conflicting, evidence. Snyder v. Burl C. Lange, Inc., 109 Idaho 167, 706 P.2d 56 (1985).

       </p>
       <p>
        The finding of the industrial commission that the claimant was not required to work 80-120 hours a week during the absence of the assistant manager was supported by substantial competent, although conflicting evidence, and hence would not be disturbed, where the claimant did not keep a time card, there was no unusual surge of business activity requiring extraordinary hours, there was available personnel and man hours per shift to do the work, when claimant was absent from the restaurant for a week during May the assistant manager adequately managed the restaurant, putting in approximately 70 hours per week, and claimant did not work at all times when she was in the restaurant but spent hours there which were not required. Cox v. Denny’s Restaurants, 112 Idaho 321, 732 P.2d 290 (1987).

       </p>
       <p>
        Court imposed sanctions on the attorney for claimant, personally and individually, in a sum equal to reasonable attorney fees incurred by respondent on appeal, where attorney admitted during oral argument before court, that substantial and competent evidence in the record supported the commission’s finding that the preponderance of the medical evidence established that the September 1991 incident did not cause an injury nor did it cause or aggravate the condition for which claimant sought worker’s compensation. Talbot v. Ames Constr., 127 Idaho 648, 904 P.2d 560 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In review of an appeal from the industrial commission, the commission’s conclusions of law are freely reviewed by the supreme court, and its findings of fact will be upheld if they are supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record, evidence which a reasonable mind might accept such evidence as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion. Smith v. J.B. Parson Co., 127 Idaho 937, 908 P.2d 1244 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of whether an injury arose from the course of employment is a question of fact. If there is conflicting evidence, the supreme court will not overturn factual findings supported by substantial competent evidence. Hart v. Kaman Bearing & Supply, 130 Idaho 296, 939 P.2d 1375 (1997).
    Workers’ compensation claimant did not meet her burden of proving entitlement to permanent partial impairment or disability benefits where on appeal, her brief did not offer guidance as to what specific aspects of the industrial commission’s decision were under review or what relief was being sought, and she did not present a legally supported argument in her appeal since she failed to demonstrate any error by the commission. Stewart v. Sun Valley Co., 140 Idaho 381, 94 P.3d 686 (2004).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Appellate review of findings of fact made by the industrial commission is limited in scope and does not entail a de novo determination of fact. The supreme court is not concerned with whether such court would have reached the same conclusion, but rather, with whether the findings by the commission are supported by substantial, competent evidence. Graham v. Larry Donohoe Logging, 103 Idaho 824, 654 P.2d 1377 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing industrial commission decisions the supreme court must determine whether the industrial commission’s findings of fact are supported by substantial competent evidence. Snyder v. Burl C. Lange, Inc., 109 Idaho 167, 706 P.2d 56 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court’s standard of review is limited to determining whether the industrial commission’s findings and conclusions are supported by substantial and competent evidence, even though the evidence before the commission was presented by written record rather than through personal appearances at a hearing. Blayney v. City of Boise, 110 Idaho 302, 715 P.2d 972 (1986).
    The supreme court is not bound by the conclusions of law which are drawn by the industrial commission; in other words, the supreme court must set aside the order of the commission where it failed to make a proper application of law to the evidence. Bortz v. Payless Drug Store, 110 Idaho 942, 719 P.2d 1202 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court is not bound by conclusions of law drawn by the industrial commission; an order of the commission must be set aside where the law is misapplied to the evidence. On questions of law the court exercises free review. Combs v. Kelly Logging, 115 Idaho 695, 769 P.2d 572 (1989).
       </p>

        Supreme court of Idaho’s review on appeal from a commission decision is limited to questions of law, and an ascertainment as to whether the industrial commission’s factual findings are based on substantial competent evidence. Loya v. J.R. Simplot Co., 120 Idaho 62, 813 P.2d 873 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of the supreme court’s review in compensation cases is limited to questions of law and determinations of whether the industrial commission’s findings of fact are supported by substantial, competent evidence. Determinations of permanent impairment and temporary disability are question of fact for the industrial commission. If conflicting evidence exists, the supreme court will not overturn factual findings, supported by substantial and competent evidence; it does not scrutinize the weight and credibility of the evidence relied on by the commission and will disturb the commission’s findings regarding weight and credibility only if they are clearly erroneous. Soto v. J.R. Simplot, 126 Idaho 536, 887 P.2d 1043 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court’s review of decisions of the industrial commission is limited to questions of law; accordingly, factual determinations made by the commission will not be overturned when supported by substantial and competent, though conflicting, evidence; the substantial and competent evidence standard is consistent with the clearly erroneous standard of Idaho R. Civ. P. 52(a). Hart v. Deary High Sch., 126 Idaho 550, 887 P.2d 1057 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Idaho supreme court’s review of unemployment compensation cases involving factual disputes is restricted to determining whether the findings of fact by the industrial commission are supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record. Taylor v. Burley Care Ctr., 121 Idaho 792, 828 P.2d 821 (1991).
       </p>

        A clearly erroneous standard is utilized by the supreme court under this section, on review of a determination by the industrial commission in regard to worker claimant’s eligibility for workers’ compensation benefits. Langley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 126 Idaho 781, 890 P.2d 732 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        On supreme court review of industrial commission decisions on appeal, the supreme court reviews questions of fact only to determine if there was substantial and competent evidence to support the findings of the commission, but exercises free review over questions of law under Const., Art. V, § 9 and this section. Langley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 126 Idaho 781, 890 P.2d 732 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court review of industrial commission decisions is limited to a determination whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial and competent evidence; which substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of proof, but less than a preponderance; it is relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. Boise Orthopedic Clinic v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, 128 Idaho 161, 911 P.2d 754 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court limits the scope of its review to questions of law and determinations of whether the commission’s findings of fact are supported by substantial competent evidence; construes the record most favorably to the party prevailing below and does not try the matter anew. Hart v. Kaman Bearing & Supply, 130 Idaho 296, 939 P.2d 1375 (1997).
    In reviewing a decision of the commission the appellate court will not disturb the commission’s conclusions on the weight and credibility of the evidence unless they are clearly erroneous. Boley v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, 130 Idaho 278, 939 P.2d 854 (1997); Gomez v. Dura Mark, Inc., 152 Idaho 597, 272 P.3d 569 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission’s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal, where they are supported by substantial and competent evidence and where conflicting evidence is presented that is supported by substantial, competent evidence; the findings reached by the commission must be sustained regardless of whether the appellate court may have reached a different conclusion. Harris v. Elec. Wholesale, 141 Idaho 1, 105 P.3d 267 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the supreme court reviews a decision of the industrial commission, it exercises free review over questions of law, but reviews questions of fact only to determine whether substantial and competent evidence supports the commission’s findings. Substantial and competent evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. Because the commission is the fact finder, its conclusions on the credibility and weight of the evidence will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. The supreme court does not weigh the evidence or consider whether it would have reached a different conclusion from the evidence presented. Whether a claimant has an impairment and the degree of permanent disability resulting from an industrial injury are questions of fact. Funes v. Aardema Dairy, 150 Idaho 7, 244 P.3d 151 (2010).

        Idaho industrial commission’s finding that the claimant failed to show that his herniated disc was caused by a compensable accident was not supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record. The court held that the claimant’s testimony was credible because, although his descriptions as to the cause of his injury were more vague prior to the oral hearing, he consistently maintained that his injury arose from the jostling and vibrations of his forklift; the claimant’s testimony was not the only evidence linking his herniated disc to March 9, 2004, as two physicians stated that the acute onset of pain that the claimant experienced on that date was consistent with a finding that his disc herniated at that time.

       <p>
        Decision by the Idaho industrial commission to deny workers’ compensation benefits for an employee’s claim of non-acute lumbar spine occupational disease was based on substantial competent evidence because the independent medical examine report was based on the fact that it was impossible to establish a causal connection between the employee’s job and his back condition as back pain was so common and no accident had occurred.

        Assignment of Error.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In compensation cases, assignments of error not discussed, orally or in brief and on which no authorities were cited would not be considered by the supreme court. Crowley v. Idaho Indus. Training Sch., 53 Idaho 606, 26 P.2d 180 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no statutory or other binding requirement of assignment of errors on appeal to the district court from the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], it was error for the court to dismiss the appeal for failure to assign errors. Long v. State Ins. Fund, 60 Idaho 257, 90 P.2d 973 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the appellant made five specifications of error and recited that “The Industrial Accident Board erred” “in entering its Findings of Fact” “V” and “VI,” “in entering its Rulings of law I” and “II” and “in entering its award in favor of the State of Idaho and disallowing the applicant’s claim of dependency,” sufficiently met the requirements of the rules of the supreme court to warrant a review by the tribunal where the specifications were thoroughly discussed in briefs and supported by relevant authority. Mauldin v. Sunshine Mining Co., 61 Idaho 9, 97 P.2d 608 (1939).
    Error was never presumed on appeal, but appellants had the burden of showing error affirmatively. Patrick v. Smith Baking Co., 64 Idaho 190, 129 P.2d 651 (1942).

        Evidence.

       <p>
        The supreme court would review the evidence produced before the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], upon which they made findings, to determine its competency and relevancy to support the findings made by such board, and would be governed by rules applicable to a trial before the court. In re Black, 58 Idaho 803, 80 P.2d 24 (1938), overruled on other grounds, Hite v. Kulhenak Bldg. Contractors, 96 Idaho 70, 524 P.2d 531 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction into evidence by the commission of the AMA Guide to Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (1971), was permissible and represented “substantial competent” evidence. Hite v. Kulhenak Bldg. Contractor, 96 Idaho 70, 524 P.2d 531 (1974).

        Findings of Board.
       </h5>
       <p>
        While findings of fact are conclusive on appeal, there must be some evidence in support thereof, and where such findings are absolutely unsupported they may be reviewed as matter of law. Ybaibarriaga v. Farmer, 39 Idaho 361, 228 P. 227 (1924); Kaylor v. Callahan Zinc-Lead Co., 43 Idaho 477, 253 P. 132 (1927); In re Hillhouse’s Estate, 46 Idaho 730, 271 P. 459 (1928); In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929); Jenkins v. Boise Payette Lumber Co., 49 Idaho 24, 287 P. 202 (1930); Beaver v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 55 Idaho 275, 41 P.2d 605 (1934); Fields v. Buffalo-Idaho Mining Co., 55 Idaho 212, 40 P.2d 114 (1935); Stoddard v. Mason’s Blue Link Stores, 55 Idaho 609, 45 P.2d 597 (1935); Bybee v. Idaho Equity Exch., 57 Idaho 396, 65 P.2d 730 (1937); In re Black, 58 Idaho 803, 80 P.2d 24 (1938); Chambers v. State ex rel. Parsons, 59 Idaho 200, 81 P.2d 748 (1938); Paull v. Preston Theatres Corp., 63 Idaho 594, 124 P.2d 562 (1942); Benson v. Jarvis, 64 Idaho 107, 127 P.2d 784 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless the board or a majority thereof heard and saw the witness testify, its findings were not considered conclusive by a court on appeal. Phipps v. Boise St. Car Co., 61 Idaho 740, 107 P.2d 148 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the issue as to notice was raised, the failure of the board to find thereon was reversible error and required remanding of the proceedings for further findings of facts. Clayton v. Hercules Mining Co., 63 Idaho 301, 119 P.2d 890 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the facts disclosed in a settlement agreement between an injured employee and the employer were adopted by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] as its findings of fact, they were conclusive as between the parties in the absence of fraud. Zapantis v. Central Idaho Mining & Milling Co., 64 Idaho 498, 136 P.2d 154 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The extent of a logger’s disability preventing performance of such logging duties as he had been able to do prior to injury, raised no more than a question of fact, and the board’s finding thereon was not subject to review by the supreme court. McCall v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 67 Idaho 415, 182 P.2d 156 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] based on substantial though conflicting evidence on factual issues was binding on appeal. Limprecht v. Bybee, 76 Idaho 293, 281 P.2d 1047 (1955).
    It was only in cases where the evidence was not conflicting and not in dispute that the application of law to the undisputed facts raised a question of law granting the supreme court jurisdiction on appeals from the industrial accident board [now industrial commission]. Miller v. Bingham County, 79 Idaho 87, 310 P.2d 1089 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The finding of the board that claimant failed to prove more than a possibility that the injury to her husband contributed to or hastened death was conclusive, the claim being based upon the asserted ground that the injury sustained in the fall aggravated pre-existing infirmities and thus contributed to and hastened death which was directly due to nephritis. Peterson v. Jerome Coop. Creamery Ass’n, 79 Idaho 406, 319 P.2d 187 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to factual findings of the board, the supreme court was restricted to a determination of whether the findings were supported by substantial and competent evidence. Madron v. Green Giant Co., 94 Idaho 747, 497 P.2d 1048 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings supported by substantial evidence must stand. Lynskey v. Lind, 94 Idaho 788, 498 P.2d 1261 (1972).

        — Conflicting Evidence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The weight and credence to be given evidence was for the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] to determine. The board’s findings when supported by substantial competent evidence, had to be sustained, even though there may have been other conflicting evidence. In re Sutton, 83 Idaho 265, 361 P.2d 793 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the facts were in conflict as to the actual relationship existing, it became the duty of the trier of facts to determine the ultimate fact whether the relation was that of employer and employee or principal and independent contractor. Beutler v. MacGregor Triangle Co., 85 Idaho 415, 380 P.2d 1 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the death of a man suffering from acute myocardial infarction who died from a coronary thrombosis or occlusion while attempting to loosen gravel around a manhole cover with a pick was due to overexertion or strain was a question of fact for the board and, where the evidence was conflicting, the board’s finding will not be set aside on appeal. Bradshaw v. Bench Sewer Dist., 90 Idaho 557, 414 P.2d 661 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was the arbiter of conflicting evidence presented in a claim under the workmen’s compensation law, and if the board’s determination was supported by substantial, competent evidence, it would not be disturbed on appeal. Hamby v. J.R. Simplot Co., 94 Idaho 794, 498 P.2d 1267 (1972) (decision prior to 1995 amendment).

        Fraud.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The failure of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] to award compensation for the loss of a kidney equivalent to that allowed for the loss of an arm at the shoulder, did not, in and of itself, constitute “fraud in law” so as to entitle the claimant, after time for appeal therefrom had expired, to reopen the matter on an application for a review of the award, since whether the claimant would be entitled to the compensation equivalent to that allowed for the loss of an arm at the shoulder necessarily depended upon the evidence in the case. Bower v. Smith, 63 Idaho 128, 118 P.2d 737 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mistake in the ascertainment of the amount of compensation payable to an injured employee did not constitute “fraud,” either active or constructive. Zapantis v. Central Idaho Mining & Milling Co., 64 Idaho 498, 136 P.2d 154 (1943).
    Absent fraud an award by the board was final and conclusive, unless modification was sought or an appeal taken. Nitkey v. Bunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Co., 73 Idaho 294, 251 P.2d 216 (1952).

        The validity of an award had to be affirmatively shown in case of direct attack and no presumptions in favor of jurisdiction or due process could be indulged. Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho 264, 220 P. 1088 (1923), overruled on other grounds, University of Utah Hosp. ex rel. Harris v. Pence, 104 Idaho 172, 657 P.2d 469 (1982).

        Question whether policy of insurance had been legally canceled was question of law which was subject to review by court. Hauter v. Coeur d’Alene Antimony Mining Co., 39 Idaho 621, 228 P. 259 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order or determination denying lump sum settlement was appealable to court. Kaylor v. Callahan Zinc-Lead Co., 43 Idaho 477, 253 P. 132 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court was limited to questions of law though facts were stipulated. Walker v. Hyde, 43 Idaho 625, 253 P. 1104 (1927); E. T. Chapin Co. v. Scott, 44 Idaho 566, 260 P. 172 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it was stipulated by the parties that the claimant’s claim was not filed within a year after the accident, the court had to conclude that the claimant could not recover compensation. Moody v. State Hwy. Dep’t, 56 Idaho 21, 48 P.2d 1108 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an appellant did not, by specification of error, challenge the board’s conclusion of law that a claimant was entitled to an award of compensation because actually dependent wholly or partially on decedent, there was no question of law presented as to what effect, if any, the resumption of the marital relationship between claimant and her husband had on her claim for compensation based on such dependency on deceased son. Rand v. Lafferty Transp. Co., 60 Idaho 507, 92 P.2d 786 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether findings of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] were supported by substantial, competent evidence so as to be conclusive on appeal was a “question of law” to be determined by the court. Paull v. Preston Theatres Corp., 63 Idaho 594, 124 P.2d 562 (1942); Benson v. Jarvis, 64 Idaho 107, 127 P.2d 784 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court was able to pass on question of law only in compensation appeals. Benson v. Jarvis, 64 Idaho 107, 127 P.2d 784 (1942); Cameron v. Bradley Mining Co., 66 Idaho 409, 160 P.2d 461 (1945); Wells v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 67 Idaho 420, 183 P.2d 202 (1947); Miller v. State, 69 Idaho 122, 203 P.2d 1007 (1949); Ramsey v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the facts were undisputed and the only question decided was whether or not the claimant’s employment was casual, it was a question of law, the determination of which by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was within the province of the supreme court to review. Wachtler v. Calnon, 90 Idaho 468, 413 P.2d 449 (1966).
    In an appeal from an industrial accident board [now industrial commission] ruling, the supreme court was limited to questions of law. Madron v. Green Giant Co., 94 Idaho 747, 497 P.2d 1048 (1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        The court remanded this case to permit proof that payments erroneously made to nonqualified foreign guardian were used for benefit of wards, dependents of deceased workman. In re Bones, 48 Idaho 85, 280 P. 223 (1929).

        Case was remanded for the employee to establish his status by taking of additional evidence. Fields v. Buffalo-Idaho Mining Co., 55 Idaho 212, 40 P.2d 114 (1935); Dehlin v. Shuck, 63 Idaho 620, 124 P.2d 244 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the claimant was a stockholder, director and manager of his employer corporation, and it appeared that the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] had decided the case without considering all the available evidence, the order denying compensation would be reversed and the matter remitted to the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] with instructions to take additional evidence, which appeared to be available, in order to establish whether or not the claimant was employed as a laborer at the time the injury was sustained so as to come within the purview of the workmen’s compensation law. Fields v. Buffalo-Idaho Mining Co., 55 Idaho 212, 40 P.2d 114 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no award was made by the board and the evidence was insufficient to sustain the findings of the board adverse to the claimant, but the evidence to sustain findings and an award in favor of the claimant was sufficient to entitle him to recover compensation, the supreme court (and formerly the district court) may have remanded the case to the board with instructions to enter up an award in favor of claimant.

       <p>
        The supreme court may have sent the case back to the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] for additional findings of fact where the award was affirmed but was upon different grounds to those assigned by board, as where the board decided there was an accident and the supreme court concluded there was no accident, but that the claim would be sustained on the theory that the deceased died from an occupational disease.

        Where doctor’s testimony was that claimant had a low back disability, a disability of 15 to 18% of the loss of a leg at the hip and a like percentage of the loss of the arm at the shoulder, but there was ambiguity in the record as to whether these two estimates related to an industrial accident or an automobile accident which was not compensable, the board should have taken additional testimony or made an award upon the record.

        Where there had been an appeal from the award of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] to the supreme court, which was reversed for the lack of sufficient findings, and the board was directed by the appellate court to make findings without directing what findings to make, or what conclusions to reach, the new award stood to all intents and purposes the same as if entered upon a new trial, and as if the second appeal was the first and only appeal taken therefrom, although no new evidence was heard by the board before the second findings and award were made and a motion would not lie to dismiss the appeal. In re MacKenzie, 55 Idaho 663, 46 P.2d 73 (1935). See also In re MacKenzie, 54 Idaho 481, 33 P.2d 113 (1934).

        In reviewing hearings before industrial accident board [now industrial commission] upon question whether evidence sustained finding, court would consider competency, relevancy, and materiality of evidence according to rules applicable to trials in court. McNeil v. Panhandle Lumber Co., 34 Idaho 773, 203 P. 1068 (1921); Ybaibarriaga v. Farmer, 39 Idaho 361, 228 P. 227 (1924); In re Larson, 48 Idaho 136, 279 P. 1087 (1929).
    In cases where evidence was not conflicting and not in dispute, application of law to such undisputed evidence raised question of law and not of fact. Johnston v. A.C.

        Receipt of incompetent evidence did not require reversal if there was competent evidence to sustain findings. Butler v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., 46 Idaho 326, 268 P. 6 (1928); Arneson v. Robinson, 59 Idaho 223, 82 P.2d 249 (1938).

       <p>
        Where there was no dispute in the evidence and it was not susceptible of more than one inference, then a question of law was presented, but if reasonable men could draw different inferences, then the findings of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] were conclusive. Vaughn v. Robertson & Thomas, 54 Idaho 138, 29 P.2d 756 (1934); Walker v. Hogue, 67 Idaho 484, 185 P.2d 708 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it appeared that the average weekly wage had not been proven, but notwithstanding this fact compensation was arbitrarily fixed and allowed, the order would be reversed and the case remanded to the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] with directions to permit the employee to submit evidence supplying the deficiency, and that the board then make findings of fact and conclusions of law in conformity with the evidence. Feuling v. Farmers’ Co-op. Ditch Co., 54 Idaho 326, 31 P.2d 683 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding of the board that the inhalation of copper carbonate fumes and dust by the claimant caused him to cough and sneeze a great deal, and that his infected appendix was disturbed and aggravated, and it became necessary to remove the same. Liberg v. Genesee Union Whse. Co., 55 Idaho 123, 38 P.2d 999 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Positive medical evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that the claimant’s disability was due to his inhalation of sulphur dust while engaged in sulphuring peas for his employer. Bybee v. Idaho Equity Exch., 57 Idaho 396, 65 P.2d 730 (1937).
    Where the evidence tended to prove that the employee was going “down town” to his employer’s office, where he kept on deposit the lodge funds of which he was treasurer, for the purpose of depositing funds he had collected for his employer, and to proceed on to the post office, which was also “down town,” and that when the accident occurred, he was on the way which he could and would have used in going to discharge either one of the duties; this evidence was sufficient to sustain an award of compensation as arising out of, and in the course of, his employment. Potter v. Realty Trust Co., 60 Idaho 281, 90 P.2d 699 (1939). See however Baldwin v. Singer Sewing Mach. Co., 49 Idaho 231, 287 P. 944 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was a substantial conflict in the medical testimony as to whether the disease from which the employee died was transverse myelitis or acute poliomyelitis, the finding of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] would not be disturbed. Rand v. Lafferty Transp. Co., 60 Idaho 507, 92 P.2d 786 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there was sufficient competent evidence to sustain the findings of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] insofar as they were findings of fact, that there was no causal connection between the injury received by an employee from the accidental overturning of a truck, which concededly arose in the course of, and out of, his employment, and a gunshot wound which caused his death, then the supreme court was bound by such findings and had to affirm the order of the board. Brink v. H. Earl Clack Co., 60 Idaho 730, 96 P.2d 500 (1939). (The supreme court held there was a causal connection and reversed the order of the industrial board).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where industrial accident board [now industrial commission] did not itself hear and determine claim for unemployment compensation but heard and determined claim on a transcript of evidence and proceedings had before the examiner, the supreme court was not bound by decision of board that discharged employee was guilty of such misconduct as to justify delay in payment of his unemployment compensation, but supreme court would examine the record to determine whether evidence showed such misconduct. Phipps v. Boise St. Car Co., 61 Idaho 740, 107 P.2d 148 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court would not disturb a finding by the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] where the witnesses had personally appeared and testified before the board, and the evidence was of such nature as might lead different minds to different conclusions. Fackenthall v. Eggers Pole & Supply Co., 62 Idaho 46, 108 P.2d 300 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding that claimant’s condition was substantially the same as it had been more than a year earlier on the date of the entry of an award of compensation for the loss of a kidney, which had been removed as a result of the injury, was supported by claimant’s own testimony with respect to his physical condition, as well as the testimony of physicians, and hence would not be disturbed by the supreme court on appeal from the board’s order denying additional compensation. Bower v. Smith, 63 Idaho 128, 118 P.2d 737 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony of a physician who observed and treated the claimant over a period of several months regarding the permanency of claimant’s disability, and the physician’s opinion that the claimant was able to work at the time of the hearing, constituted “competent and substantial evidence,” sustaining the industrial accident board’s [now industrial commission] award allowing compensation for total temporary disability but denying compensation for permanent disability. Stroscheim v. Shay, 63 Idaho 360, 120 P.2d 267 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court would not disturb an order of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] dismissing an application for modification of a compensation agreement where the order was supported by substantial competent evidence. Pruett v. Cranston Chevrolet Co., 63 Idaho 478, 121 P.2d 559 (1941).
    On appeal, the supreme court could neither weigh the evidence nor make findings of fact. Dyre v. Kloepfer & Cahoon, 64 Idaho 612, 134 P.2d 610 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where witnesses testified by deposition and did not appear before the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] to testify and thus give the board an opportunity to hear and see them, the supreme court had to examine the evidence and determine its value. Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 65 Idaho 339, 144 P.2d 210 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence was conflicting as to whether the employee’s death was due from poisoning from food eaten at employer’s boarding house or from diabetes, the court would not disturb the order of the board denying compensation. Cameron v. Bradley Mining Co., 66 Idaho 409, 160 P.2d 461 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the record failed to disclose that respondent’s blindness was superinduced other than through an accidental injury and there was no evidence that it was caused by Harada’s disease, there was no alternative other than to affirm the award. Wells v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 67 Idaho 415, 183 P.2d 202 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court was not a fact-finding body in compensation cases; its only function was to determine whether there was sufficient substantial evidence before board to sustain its conclusions of fact. Walker v. Hogue, 67 Idaho 484, 185 P.2d 708 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        The credit and weight to be given to the testimony in industrial accident proceedings were for the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] and the board’s findings were conclusive upon appeal if supported by competent evidence. Miller v. State, 69 Idaho 122, 203 P.2d 1007 (1949); Dawson v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 82 Idaho 406, 353 P.2d 765 (1960); In re Sutton, 83 Idaho 265, 361 P.2d 793 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was substantial evidence to support finding of board, though evidence was conflicting, finding by board that condition of claimant’s leg resulting in amputation, was not due to an accident in the employment, but was the result of disease of diabetes, will be sustained by the court on appeal. Johansen v. Ferry-Morse Seed Co., 69 Idaho 275, 206 P.2d 545 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court in reviewing action of industrial accident board [now industrial commission] would only determine whether findings of board were supported by competent and substantial evidence. Smith v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 74 Idaho 470, 264 P.2d 684 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        The findings and conclusions made by the board that deceased died from natural causes, not from an accidental personal injury, were based on substantial evidence, sufficient to support such findings and conclusions and hence could not be disturbed on appeal. Darvell v. Wardner Indus. Union, 78 Idaho 309, 302 P.2d 950 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was a substantial conflict in the evidence as to whether deceased received an injury and occupational disease caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment and that death did result therefrom, the findings of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] would not be disturbed. Moeller v. Volco Bldrs.’ Supply, Inc., 81 Idaho 349, 341 P.2d 447 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] would not be disturbed on appeal where secondary evidence supporting such finding became primary when it was admitted without objection. Clevenger v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 82 Idaho 406, 353 P.2d 396 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial accident board [now industrial commission] properly concluded from the evidence that claimant did not sustain the burden of proving by preponderance of the evidence that death of employee who was suffering from carcinoma of the esophagus and a heart condition was precipitated or contributed to by accidental injury suffered during employment. Dawson v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 82 Idaho 406, 353 P.2d 765 (1960).
    If the order of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] was clearly unsupported as a matter of law, it was within the province of the supreme court to set it aside. Duncan v. Jacobsen Constr. Co., 83 Idaho 254, 360 P.2d 987 (1961); Beutler v. MacGregor Triangle Co., 85 Idaho 415, 380 P.2d 1 (1963); Comish v. J. R. Simplot Fertilizer Co., 86 Idaho 79, 383 P.2d 333 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that doubtful workmen’s compensation cases should be resolved in favor of the awarding of compensation did not apply to a review of industrial accident board’s [now industrial commission] findings of fact which were supported by substantial, competent evidence. Bennett v. Bunker Hill Co., 88 Idaho 300, 399 P.2d 270 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that positive testimony was entitled to more weight than negative testimony did not apply to the appellate court’s examination of the record of proceedings in a workmen’s compensation case. The weight to be given the testimony, the credibility of the witnesses and the reasonable conclusions and inferences to be derived from the record were peculiarly within the province of the board, and not of this court. Bennett v. Bunker Hill Co., 88 Idaho 300, 399 P.2d 270 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the claimant received a disabling back injury in 1960 while working for one employer and another in 1963 while working for another employer and had received several nondisabling back injuries prior to 1960 and surgeons who treated him for the 1963 injury testified that the injuries prior to 1960 had not contributed to his disability, an award of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] apportioning compensation between the 1960 and 1963 injuries would not have been reversed because of its finding that there was no competent evidence to justify a finding that the pre-1960 injuries contributed to his disability. Cook v. Roland T. Romrell Co., 90 Idaho 155, 409 P.2d 104 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where medical experts disagreed as to whether physical exertion of a man suffering from acute myocardial infarction caused a coronary thrombosis or occlusion from which he died, the finding of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] that his death was not from an accident arising out of his employment would not be set aside on appeal. Bradshaw v. Bench Sewer Dist., 90 Idaho 557, 414 P.2d 661 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision of the board denying compensation for the death of an employee from the bursting of an aneurysm on an artery in his brain, which bursting occurred while the decedent was on the job, was sufficiently supported where the record contained no evidence as to what the decedent was doing at the time of the bursting and medical evidence disagreed as to the probable cause of the rupture, but there was some medical testimony that the rupture would have happened eventually and might have happened at any time regardless of the decedent’s activity. Tipton v. Jansson, 91 Idaho 904, 435 P.2d 244 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        With conflicting evidence as to the date the disabling accident occurred, as to which accident was the cause of the claimant’s disability, and as to when the claimant became mentally incompetent, findings of the board that the claim was barred by failure to file within one year, that the statute of limitations was not tolled by the claimant’s mental incompetency, and that his disability was not caused by the accident upon which his claim was based could not be reviewed on appeal to the supreme court. Gregg v. Orr, 92 Idaho 30, 436 P.2d 245 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that claimant, when injured, was engaged in excavating at a mining site for the operation of which a mining corporation was later incorporated, with equipment belonging to a construction company, under direction of officers of the construction company who also became officers of the mining company, that he was paid by officers of the construction company who were later reimbursed by the company, and that his report of injury was signed by the president of the construction company as such president was sufficient to sustain the industrial accident board’s [now industrial commission] finding that the claimant was an employee of the construction company at the time of his injury. Atkins v. C. B. Eaton & Sons, Inc., 92 Idaho 172, 438 P.2d 917 (1968).
    Although the findings of fact of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], if they were supported by substantial, competent evidence, were binding on the court, it was within the province of the court to set aside an award not supported as a matter of law. Spanbauer v. Peter Kiewit Sons’ Co., 93 Idaho 509, 465 P.2d 633 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of industrial accident board [now industrial commission] would not be set aside where appellants failed to establish from the facts any material conflict between the record and the findings of the board and the findings were supported by substantial, competent evidence. Clark v. Sage, 95 Idaho 79, 502 P.2d 323 (1972).

        Where a judgment for claimant was entered in the district court upon a certified copy of an award of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], after the award had been affirmed by the supreme court, no appeal lay from such a judgment.

        If the question of the district court’s jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing a workmen’s compensation award was involved, an application may have been made for a writ of review. Haines v. State Ins. Fund, 65 Idaho 450, 145 P.2d 833 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The workmen’s compensation act provision making the judgment of the district court respecting the enforcement of a workmen’s compensation award final, and prohibiting appeal therefrom, could not be evaded by the indirect method of appealing from an order denying a motion to set aside the nonappealable judgment entered pursuant to the terms of the workmen’s compensation act and prohibiting appeal therefrom. Haines v. State Ins. Fund, 65 Idaho 450, 145 P.2d 833 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        An appeal did not lie from the district court order denying a motion of the state insurance fund, as surety, to set aside a judgment of the district court to enforce a compensation award where no appeal was taken from the award and the statutory time therefor had expired; the remedy being by application to the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] for the correction of the award allegedly procured by fraud. Haines v. State Ins. Fund, 65 Idaho 450, 145 P.2d 833 (1944).
    Where the board, in awarding compensation for temporary total disability, reserved the determination of claimant’s request for attorney’s fees until the final disposition of the claim and had made no finding as to whether the employer contested the claimant’s claim on reasonable ground, the supreme court referred the matter of attorney’s fees to the board for determination as a factual issue.

        In view of the uniquely broad grant of original and exclusive jurisdiction over workers’ compensation matters given to the industrial commission, and the fact that this section confers upon the commission the jurisdiction to resolve claims for attorney fees, there exists a legislative intent that jurisdiction over claims by a client against his attorney arising out of their fee agreement in a workers’ compensation case is properly with the industrial commission, and not the district court.

        In acting beyond the bounds of its statutory authority by sua sponte modifying appellants’ uncontested attorney fee agreements the commission has acted arbitrarily and capriciously and has manifestly abused its discretion. These abuses have bred discomfort and uncertainty in appellants and other attorneys.

    Where injured worker received a lump sum settlement of workers’ compensation benefits, and worker owed child support and arrearages from two previous marriages and support obligations for the care of another child, the district court erred in holding that attorney fees deducted from the lump sum settlement agreement must be added back into the settlement amount before garnishment percentage under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.11.html#t11c02s11-207" target="_blank">§ 11-207 </a></cite>was taken, for pursuant to this section, claims for attorney fees were subject to approval by the industrial commission and since the commission had approved the lump sum agreement in its order and had also approved and awarded the attorney fees, the attorney fees were not part of the lump sum award and were not subject to the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.11.html#t11c02s11-207" target="_blank">§ 11-207</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and competent evidence existed to support the industrial commission’s order denying an attorney’s motion for reconsideration of the commission’s previous order partially denying the attorney’s request for attorney’s fees, as the attorney did not show that his efforts “primarily or substantially” secured the PPI award for his client in that it was the injured worker’s doctor who initiated the determination of the worker’s PPI rating.

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of attorney fees was proper where the testimony supported the conclusion that any work employee’s attorney did was directed at encouraging employer to accept full responsibility for the medical bills related to two surgeries, which they questioned but fully accepted immediately after consulting with outside counsel, and not as a result of anything employee’s attorney did.

        In effecting the attorney fee modifications under the claimed authority of this section where there is no fee dispute, the commission is acting in its quasi-legislative as opposed to its quasi-judicial capacity.

In sua sponte modifying the appellants’ uncontested attorney fees absent the guidelines of a properly enacted regulatory scheme, the commission infracted both perimeters. Curr v.

        The language of this section contemplates that the industrial commission will monitor the appropriateness of fees on behalf of claimants, and therefore a regulation restricting the amount of legal fees recoverable by an attorney representing injured workers, provides a reasonable interpretation of the power vested by this section.

      If the commission or any court before whom any proceedings are brought under this law determines that the employer or his surety contested a claim for compensation made by an injured employee or dependent of a deceased employee without reasonable ground, or that an employer or his surety neglected or refused within a reasonable time after receipt of a written claim for compensation to pay to the injured employee or his dependents the compensation provided by law, or without reasonable grounds discontinued payment of compensation as provided by law justly due and owing to the employee or his dependents, the employer shall pay reasonable attorney fees in addition to the compensation provided by this law. In all such cases the fees of attorneys employed by injured employees or their dependents shall be fixed by the commission.

       <p>
        Idaho industrial commission erred by denying an award of attorney’s fees to an employee, after it had determined that the employer’s denial of benefits was unreasonable, because it ignored the directive in this section and failed to consider the
    Hogaboom
    (
        Hogaboom v. Economy Mattress
        , 107 Idaho 13, 684 P.2d 990 (1984)) factors. Bradley v. Wash. Group Int’l, 141 Idaho 655, 115 P.3d 746 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a surety unreasonably denied medical care and temporary total disability (TTD) benefits and unreasonably delayed paying for a portion of a claimant’s medical care and all of the claimant’s TTD’s, the industrial commission properly awarded the claimant attorney’s fees pursuant to this section. However, because there was a reasonable basis for the surety to challenge the adequacy of the medical evidence supporting the finding that the claimant’s tremors were caused by an industrial accident, the claimant was not entitled to attorney’s fees on appeal pursuant to this section. Anderson v. Harper’s, Inc., 143 Idaho 193, 141 P.3d 1062 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employer merely asked an appellate court to reweigh the evidence in a temporary total disability case and make a different decision, costs and attorney’s fees were properly awarded to a claimant on review. Hutton v. Manpower, Inc., 143 Idaho 573, 149 P.3d 848 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho industrial commission’s finding that the claimant failed to show that his herniated disc was caused by a compensable accident was not supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record; the court held that the claimant’s testimony was credible because, although his descriptions as to the cause of his injury were more vague prior to the oral hearing, he consistently maintained that his injury arose from the jostling and vibrations of his forklift; the claimant’s testimony was not the only evidence linking his herniated disc to March 9, 2004, as two physicians stated that the acute onset of pain that the claimant experienced on that date was consistent with a finding that his disc herniated at that time. The court awarded the claimant attorney’s fees because the denial of his claim was unreasonable, as the record overwhelmingly indicated that he herniated his disc during his work shift on March 9, 2004. Stevens-McAtee v. Potlatch Corp., 145 Idaho 325, 179 P.3d 288 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial commission incorrectly awarded attorney fees to an injured worker on the basis that it was unreasonable for a surety to refuse full payment for the worker’s medical bills. It was not unreasonable for the surety to take the position that it was entitled to review bills for reasonableness. Neel v. W. Constr., Inc., 147 Idaho 146, 206 P.3d 852 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee was not the prevailing party on appeal and therefore was not entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs. Gibson v. Ada County Sheriff’s Office, 147 Idaho 491, 211 P.3d 100 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because counsel stipulated to an attorney fee award under this section, he could not also recover attorney fees under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c08s72-803" target="_self">§ 72-803 </a></cite>for work that had already been paid for by the employer under this section.

       <p>
        Though a decedent’s dependents sought to modify the industrial commission’s decision, they failed to file a necessary cross-appeal. As a result, the question whether the commission erred in failing to award attorney fees to the dependents was not properly before the supreme court. Hamilton v. Alpha Servs., LLC, 158 Idaho 683, 351 P.3d 611 (2015).

       <p>
        Where there was no serious contention that the claimant was 100 percent disabled, but the sole issue was what allocation of compensation should be made between the state industrial special indemnity fund and claimant’s employer and its surety, the claimant was awarded attorney’s fees on his appeal, since the fund and the surety could have made arrangements to compensate the claimant and litigate the allocation issue themselves without causing him to hire his own counsel for appeal. Curtis v. Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office, 102 Idaho 300, 629 P.2d 696 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it was not unreasonable for employer to raise on appeal the effect of an injured worker’s incarceration in the state penitentiary upon his award of permanent disability, claimant’s request for attorney’s fees was denied. Yardley v. Chuck’s Freezer Meats, 123 Idaho 221, 846 P.2d 223 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Injured worker’s claims that employer’s workers’ compensation surety had breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing and had breached their fiduciary duty by initially refusing to satisfy appellant’s workers’ compensation claims were held by the supreme court to be claims arising under this section as worker’s claims related to the premises for an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to this section. Van Tine v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, 126 Idaho 688, 889 P.2d 717 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the employer and surety were merely asking the court to reweigh the evidence presented to the commission, attorney’s fees and costs on appeal were appropriate. Wutherich v. Terteling Co., 135 Idaho 593, 21 P.3d 915 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees and costs are properly awarded when an appeal asks the supreme court to do nothing more than reweigh the evidence submitted to the Idaho industrial commission. Eacret v. Clearwater Forest Indus., 136 Idaho 733, 40 P.3d 91 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees and costs were properly awarded when employer’s appeal asked the supreme court to do nothing more than reweigh the evidence submitted to the commission. Spivey v. Novartis Seed Inc., 137 Idaho 29, 43 P.3d 788 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers’ compensation claimant was not entitled to attorney’s fees on appeal, where the claimant only prevailed in part in the appeal. Hoskins v. Circle A Constr., Inc., 138 Idaho 336, 63 P.3d 462 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the claim for workers’ compensation benefits had not been resolved, and a remand to the Idaho industrial commission was necessary, the determination of whether the employer had contested the claimant’s claim without reasonable ground was left to the discretion of the commission, and if the commission found in favor of the claimant and awarded benefits, the commission could then determine if attorney’s fees based on the appeal were warranted. Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., 141 Idaho 342, 109 P.3d 1084 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court rejected the employee’s request for attorney’s fees in the employer’s surety’s appeal of the industrial commission’s decision apportioning the employee’s disability between the employer and industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) because the issue of whether the

        , 107 Idaho 109, 866 P.2d 54 (1984)) apportionment formula should have been modified to expressly consider a pre-existing permanent partial disability (PPD) rating was an issue of first impression. Clark v. Idaho Truss, 142 Idaho 404, 128 P.3d 941 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers’ compensation case where there were two appeals, a benefits claimant was entitled to receive attorney fees for the first appeal since she prevailed on the issues of notice and whether there was an accident; however, no attorney fees were awarded as to the second appeal because the claimant did not prevail on all issues. Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., 145 Idaho 302, 179 P.3d 265 (2008).
    Where the employer and the Idaho state insurance fund had reasonable grounds to contest the claim because case law on the statute of limitations for filing claims was unclear, claimant was not entitled to attorney fees. Nelson v. City of Bonners Ferry, 149 Idaho 29, 232 P.3d 807 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employer advanced the same arguments on appeal as he did below and simply asked the supreme court to reweigh evidence already presented to the industrial commission, the decedent’s dependents were entitled to attorney fees and costs on appeal. Hamilton v. Alpha Servs., LLC, 158 Idaho 683, 351 P.3d 611 (2015).

        Supreme court declined to award the claimant attorney fees on appeal, where the employer provided a reasonable argument on appeal. Atkinson v. 2M Co., 164 Idaho 577, 434 P.3d 181 (2019).

        Where industrial commission had approved a claimant’s contingent fee agreement with his attorney which provided for 35 percent, or about $11,000, as a reasonable attorney fee, but awarded an attorney’s fee of $2,500 because the claim had been contested by the employer’s surety without reasonable grounds, the award was reversed and remanded to the commission since it was not clear on whether the award was made on a fixed fee or contingent basis and the commission had only considered the time and effort expended rather than all possible relevant factors. Clark v. Sage, 102 Idaho 261, 629 P.2d 657 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A decision that grounds exist for awarding a claimant attorney’s fees is a factual determination which rests with the industrial commission. Lopez v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 107 Idaho 590, 691 P.2d 1205 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since there were no reasonable grounds upon which employer’s application of hearing could have been brought, attorney’s fees should only be based upon a percentage of compensation paid from the time employer’s application for hearing was filed. Kirkpatrick v. Transtector Sys., 114 Idaho 559, 759 P.2d 65 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since hearing before commission was brought without reasonable ground, the appeal was also brought without reasonable ground, with the exception of the slight modification of the attorney fee award, accordingly, court awarded attorney’s fees on appeal pursuant to this section. Kirkpatrick v. Transtector Sys., 114 Idaho 559, 759 P.2d 65 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not make the award of attorney’s fees contingent on fulfillment of some procedures of the industrial commission. Dumaw v. J.L. Norton Logging, 118 Idaho 150, 795 P.2d 312 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The industrial commission concluded that Idaho case law relating to the “special errand” exception to the going-and-coming rule was not definitive and that the rule proposed by the claimant provided the appropriate test. That test required the industrial commission to weigh the evidence regarding each of five factors, not all of which were favorable to the claimant, in order to decide whether the claimant was within the course and scope of her employment. After that weighing and balancing, the commission concluded that the factual and legal issues raised were not unreasonable and therefore denied the claimant’s motion for attorney’s fees. Trapp v. Sagle Volunteer Fire Dep’t, 122 Idaho 655, 837 P.2d 781 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employer’s arguments as to the existence of the impairment and the extent of claimant’s disability were nothing but efforts to have the supreme court reweigh evidence on appeal and where employer’s contention that<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c04s72-403" target="_self">§ 72-403 </a></cite>barred recovery by claimant was utterly without merit, an award of attorney’s fees to claimant was appropriate. Baker v. Louisiana Pac. Corp., 123 Idaho 799, 853 P.2d 544 (1993).
    This section applies only where unreasonable conduct appears, and an award of attorney’s fees in a worker’s compensation case must be deemed compensation to the injured employee and not as a penalty against the employer or surety. Dennis v. School Dist. 91, 135 Idaho 94, 15 P.3d 329 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Key to this section, which governs the award of attorney’s fees in proceedings before the Idaho industrial commission, is that there is no reasonable grounds for the contesting or denial of the award. Hoskins v. Circle A Constr., Inc., 138 Idaho 336, 63 P.3d 462 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers’ compensation claimant could not recover attorney’s fees under this section, as he cited no legal authority for his argument that the employer engaged in a course of conduct designed to deceive him and the industrial commission. Frank v. Bunker Hill Co., 150 Idaho 76, 244 P.3d 220 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho industrial commission erred in awarding attorney’s fees to a claimant, based upon a referee’s finding that a surety discontinued medical benefits for a prolonged period of time without a reasonable ground, where the claimant failed to prove that she was entitled to payment of compensation to begin with. Salinas v. Bridgeview Estates, 162 Idaho 91, 394 P.3d 793 (2017).

        A fee arrangement, which provides that the attorney would receive 33 1/3% of any amount received through his efforts or attorney’s fees awarded by the court, does not limit the industrial commission to the terms of the contingency fee in its award of reasonable attorney’s fees; such a limitation would frustrate the representation element of this section by restricting the ability of injured claimants to retain competent counsel. Hogaboom v. Economy Mattress, 107 Idaho 13, 684 P.2d 990 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to this section, the industrial commission need not be constrained by the contingent fee agreement in effect between the claimant and his attorney in the presence of a clause providing for the alternative of awarded attorney’s fees. In such a case, as in the case of all awards of attorney’s fees, the commission must arrive at a reasonable award considering not only the factors cited in

        An employee’s right to attorney’s fees pursuant to a specific statutory provision is not to be controlled by a technical interpretation of the rules of the industrial commission, and where an employee claimed attorney’s fees in his first pleading, where his right to attorney’s fees was dependent on the commission’s determination with regard to whether the employer’s surety had discontinued the employee’s compensation for total temporary disability without reasonable grounds, and where the issue of the employee’s entitlement to more compensation for total temporary disability remained in the statement of issues throughout the proceedings, this was sufficient to entitle the employee to have his claim for attorney’s fees considered when he was awarded further compensation for his temporary disability even though he did not continue to expressly request attorney’s fees throughout the proceedings.

        The purpose of enacting the workmen’s compensation laws in Idaho was to provide sure relief for injured workers and their dependents. In providing for the payment of attorney’s fees in certain cases, the legislature sought to further this purpose in several ways: first, the legislature sought to encourage claimants to press claims which, but for such provision, would not be worth their time and effort once the costs of hiring of attorney had been deducted from the award; and second, the legislature meant to encourage attorneys to represent clients and take on claims which would otherwise not be in their best financial interests due to their relative financial insignificance.

        The industrial commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that surety did not act unreasonably in failing to pay workers’ compensation claimant’s medical bills because claimant did not specify the medical bills for which payment was requested and did not link those bill to claimant’s occupational disease. Hoye v. Daw Forest Prods., Inc., 125 Idaho 582, 873 P.2d 836 (1994).
    Idaho industrial commission did not err by failing to award attorney’s fees to a former client in a legal fee dispute with an attorney because the claim was one of first impression; moreover, there was no basis for awarding attorney’s fees on appeal under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121</a></cite>.

        In view of the uniquely broad grant of original and exclusive jurisdiction over workers’ compensation matters given to the industrial commission, and the fact that<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c08s72-803" target="_self">§ 72-803 </a></cite>confers upon the commission the jurisdiction to resolve claims for attorney’s fees, there exists a legislative intent that jurisdiction over claims by a client against his attorney arising out of their fee agreement in a workers’ compensation case is properly with the industrial commission, and not the district court.

        There is nothing in either this section or prior court decisions that prevents the industrial commission from concluding, in the exercise of its discretion, that a reasonable attorney fee in a particular case is a percentage of the benefits awarded. Therefore, the commission did not err in deciding to award attorney’s fees based upon a percentage of the benefits awarded rather than upon the time spent by the attorney in representing the claimant. Swett v. St. Alphonsus Reg’l Med. Ctr., 136 Idaho 74, 29 P.3d 385 (2001).

        Where the record supported a finding that the employer, where it initially thought that the claimant’s mother was not totally dependent on the decedent son, was unreasonable either in not then accepting liability for at least a claim based on partial dependency or in not investigating further in order to ascertain that only the decedent was employed and hence at the time the sole support of his mother, and nothing was presented by the employer to show claimant’s actual dependency upon anyone other than the decedent at the time of the decedent’s death, the commission possessed the authority to award reasonable attorney’s fees. Hayes v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 104 Idaho 279, 658 P.2d 950 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based upon the evidence, the employer’s act of stopping payment on the claimant’s workers’ compensation benefits was not unreasonable and did not did not entitle the claimant to an award him attorney’s fees under this section. Hernandez v. Phillips, 141 Idaho 779, 118 P.3d 111 (2005).

        Industrial commission’s decision declining to award attorney’s fees was based upon substantial, competent evidence; the record showed that temporary total disability benefits were paid within a reasonable time after receipt of a written claim for compensation, that the surety timely paid certain medical expenses owing to a community hospital within a reasonable time after receipt of a written claim, and that knowing the claimant had an impairment rating based upon her medical examination, the surety paid the benefits within a reasonable time after receipt of a written claim for compensation.

        Where worker asked the court to construe the industrial special indemnity fund (ISIF) to be employer’s surety under this statute, ISIF was not employer’s surety in the sense that this section uses the term; ISIF does not insure the liability of the employer but rather the disability of the employee due to certain pre-existing physical impairments.

        Where the surety had ample evidence available to it to show a direct cause and effect relationship between the accident in 1972 and the claimant’s injury, and could not reasonably have believed that the claimant was not totally and permanently disabled, being informed as early as 1977 of the nature and extent of claimant’s disability, and the surety’s only real contention was the extent to which industrial special indemnity fund would be liable, but the surety in its application for a hearing raised the issue of the extent of the claimant’s disability, which required the claimant to protect his interest by being represented by counsel, the commission did not abuse its discretion or err in awarding attorney’s fees to the claimant, and attorney’s fees would also be awarded for appeal. Royce v. Southwest Pipe, 103 Idaho 290, 647 P.2d 746 (1982).
    Injured employee was entitled to attorney fees on appeal because the employer’s appeal was without reasonable ground where he was simply requesting that the evidence be reweighed and a different conclusion reached. Chavez v. Stokes, 158 Idaho 793, 353 P.3d 414 (2015).

        A law was not retroactive because part of the factual situation to which it was applied occurred prior to its enactment, rather a law was retroactive only when it operated upon transactions which had been completed, or upon rights which had been acquired, or upon obligations which had existed prior to its passage.

     <p>
      A workman shall receive written notice within fifteen (15) days of any change of status or condition including, but not limited to, the denial, reduction or cessation of medical and/or monetary compensation benefits, which directly or indirectly affects the level of compensation benefits to which he might presently or ultimately be entitled. If any change in compensation benefits is based upon a medical report or medical reports from any physician or any other practitioner of the healing arts, a copy of such report shall be attached to the written notice which the workman shall receive. The industrial commission shall by rule and regulation, determine by whom the notice shall be given and the form for such notice. In the absence of a rule governing a particular situation, the employer’s insurer, or in the case of self-insurers, the employer, shall be responsible for giving the notice required herein.

        Worker’s final benefit check did not substantially comply with the requirement to provide the worker a Notice of Claim Status, because (1) the check did not explain that the check was the worker’s final payment, (2) the effective date on which payments were considered to have stopped was unclear, making it difficult to determine when the statute of limitations began to run, and (3) the industrial commission did not receive a required copy.

        Employer and surety had to send a worker a Notice of Claim Status within 15 days of a final benefit payment, because (1) only a change of status was required, and (2) the worker’s status changed when a lump-sum payment ended the benefit payments before the scheduled date and this affected the statute of limitations within which to seek additional benefits.

       <p>
        Despite its use of the term “mutual insurance company” in the state insurance fund statute, the legislature intended only to create a state managed insurance fund that operated, in many ways, like a private mutual insurance company.

        While department may sue and be sued in matters relating to state insurance fund, its liability does not extend beyond amount of such fund. Brady v. Place, 41 Idaho 747, 242 P. 314 (1925); Brady v. Place, 41 Idaho 753, 243 P. 654 (1926). Mutual Insurance Carriers.

        An injured employee of an uninsured contractor was not entitled to recover compensation from the insured materialman on the ground that the materialman and his surety constituted the “industry,” and that the compensation act creates an entity out of the industry and charges thereto all losses sustained by an injured workman, since the act does not contemplate payment to an injured workman by the state insurance fund unless his employer is insured therewith. Moon v. Ervin, 64 Idaho 464, 133 P.2d 933 (1943).

        The language of this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c09s72-927" target="_self">§ 72-927 </a></cite>is sufficient to constitute a continuing appropriation of money in the fund for the payment of all compensation, expenses or other obligations incurred in carrying out the purpose of the law. State ex rel. Williams v. Musgrave, 84 Idaho 77, 370 P.2d 778 (1962).

       <p>
        The money in the state insurance fund does not belong to the state and is not in the state treasury within the meaning of Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 13. It is deposited with the state treasurer as custodian and is held by him as such for the contributing employers and the beneficiaries of the compensation law and for the payment of the costs of the operation of the fund.

       </p>
       <p>
        The state insurance fund is an agency of the state created for the purpose of carrying on and effectuating a proprietary function as distinguished from governmental function. It serves a public purpose but not a governmental purpose. State ex rel. Williams v. Musgrave, 84 Idaho 77, 370 P.2d 778 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state insurance fund is not a corporation within the meaning of Idaho Const., Art. III, § 19, forbidding special laws creating any corporation nor within the meaning of Idaho Const., Art. XI, § 2 against the granting of a charter by special law. Although not a corporation, the fund has some of the characteristics of a private corporation and occupies a similar status. State ex rel.

       </p>
       <p>
        The organization of the state insurance fund indicates that it is a state entity, not a private insurance company. Selkirk Seed Co. v. Forney, 134 Idaho 98, 996 P.2d 798 (2000).

        The state insurance fund is an independent agency and is not an arm of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] and has the status of a private insurance company. Therefore the filing of a claim with the state insurance fund is not the equivalent of and does not meet the requirement of the filing of a claim with the board. Atwood v.

     <p>
      The endowment fund investment board shall at the direction of the manager invest any of the surplus or reserve funds belonging to the state insurance fund in real estate and the same securities and investments authorized for investments by insurance companies in Idaho as shall be approved by the manager. The endowment fund investment board shall be the custodian of all such securities or evidences of indebtedness, provided that the endowment fund investment board may employ a custodial bank to hold such securities. The state insurance fund is authorized to pay the actual expenses of the endowment fund investment board which the board incurs in investing surplus or reserve funds and which are approved by the manager of the state insurance fund. It shall collect the principal and interest thereof, when due, and pay the same into the state insurance fund. The state treasurer shall pay all warrants or vouchers drawn on the state insurance manager and by the state controller. The endowment fund investment board at the request of the manager may sell any of such securities, the proceeds thereof to be paid over to the state treasurer for said insurance fund. Where such funds of the state insurance fund have been or are hereafter invested, with real property as security, and the said real property has been or is hereafter acquired by the state of Idaho by reason of foreclosure proceedings, voluntary deed, or otherwise, such property shall be held in trust by the state of Idaho for the benefit of the state insurance fund and may be sold by the endowment fund investment board at the request of the manager of said fund, and said sale may be had at private sale or public auction, upon such terms and under such conditions as the endowment fund investment board deems for the best interest of the state, but no sale of real estate at private sale may be had for a less price than the amount, with accrued interest, costs and expenses, which has been invested by the state insurance fund in said real estate. Where such sale is to be made at public auction, it must take place in the county where the real estate is situated, and notice of time and place of sale must be posted in three (3) of the most public places in such county, and published in a newspaper, if there be one (1) printed in the said county, for at least once a week for not less than two (2) consecutive weeks, within thirty (30) days prior to the sale. Where such sale is to be made at private sale, it must take place in the county where the real estate is situated, and notice of time and place of sale must be posted in three (3) of the most public places in such county, and published in a newspaper, if there be one (1) printed in said county, for at least once a week for not less than two (2) consecutive weeks, within thirty (30) days prior to the sale. The notice must state a day on or after which the sale will be made, and a place where offers or bids will be received. The day last referred to must be at least fifteen (15) days from the first publication of notice, and the sale must not be made before that day, but must be made within six (6) months thereafter. The bids or offers must be in writing, sealed, and delivered to the investment manager of the endowment fund investment board. The real estate and tenements, or the part thereof or interest therein to be sold, must be described with common certainty in the notice. The deed or deeds to such real estate shall be executed in the name of the state of Idaho as required by section 16, chapter 4 of the constitution of the state of Idaho, and the proceeds from any such sale be paid over to the state treasurer for said insurance funds.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2009, ch. 294 provided: “Legislative Intent. (1) Historically, the State Insurance Fund has exercised its discretion, pursuant to Section 72-915, Idaho Code, to determine the annual amount of dividend, if any, a policy holder would receive.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) On March 5, 2009, the Idaho Supreme Court filed its opinion in
    Farber v. Idaho State Insurance Fund
    , S. Ct. 35144, [withdrawn and refiled on May 5, 2009] in which it interpreted Section 72-915, Idaho Code, and ruled that the State Insurance Fund cannot exercise its discretion in determining how much of a dividend to pay to each policyholder because the statute requires a pro rata distribution of dividends to all policyholders.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In its decision, the Supreme Court stated that, if it has become prudent to alter the statutory language related to the requirements for distribution of dividends, the Legislature is the appropriate venue for such change.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) It was the intent of the Legislature in passing House Bill No. 774, As Amended of the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-fourth Idaho Legislature, effective April 3, 1998, that the State Insurance Fund should operate like an efficient insurance company, subject to regulation under Title 41, Idaho Code, including the dividend provisions set forth in Chapter 28, Title 41, Idaho Code. The retroactive repeal of Section 72-915, Idaho Code, permits such retroactive repeal as long as it is ‘expressly so declared’ in legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) The retroactive repeal of Section 72-915, Idaho Code, will reconcile conflicts in the existing laws governing the State Insurance Fund and will allow the fund, like other insurance companies, to issue dividends pursuant to Chapter 28, Title 41, Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) It is the intent of the Legislature that the provisions of this act shall not apply to any action filed in state or federal court of law in the state of Idaho on or before December 31, 2008, and the provisions of this act shall not apply to the aforementioned case of
    Farber v. Idaho State Insurance Fund

        The retroactive repeal of this section by S.L. 2009, ch. 294 was unconstitutional. The repeal does have a prospective effect and become effective upon the signature of the governor on May 6, 2009. CDA Dairy Queen, Inc. v. State Ins. Fund, 154 Idaho 379, 299 P.3d 186 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        The retroactive repeal of this section by S.L. 2009, ch. 294 substantially impaired the policyholder’s contract rights, because the dividend paid out under that section was part of the consideration of the contract. Repealing the statute that provided for the possibility of a premium refund reduced the maximum value of the contract to the policyholder. CDA Dairy Queen, Inc. v. State Ins. Fund, 154 Idaho 379, 299 P.3d 186 (2013).

        This section is not ambiguous, and policyholders are entitled to have dividends from the fund distributed according to its plain language; the fund manager has discretion as to whether to pay a dividend, but no authority to alter the terms of the distribution. Farber v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, 147 Idaho 307, 208 P.3d 289 (2009), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

       <p>
        Idaho state insurance fund manager did not have discretion regarding how to distribute dividends amongst policyholders under this section, but had to divide the aggregate balance proportionately according to the policyholders’ prior paid premiums relative to all paid premiums; this section does not permit an imposition of an arbitrary $2,500 premium-payment threshold.

       All claims for compensation against the Idaho national guard accruing on or after March 5, 1949, under the provisions of title 72, Idaho Code, on account of members of the Idaho national guard while on duty shall be deemed secured by the state insurance fund, and payment thereof shall be made to claimants entitled thereto in accordance with the provisions of title 72, Idaho Code, in the same manner and amount as any other employment insured by the state insurance fund. The manager of the state insurance fund shall service all claims as though they were insured claims and not require payment of any premium as a condition of securing the liability of the Idaho national guard, but the state insurance fund, shall in lieu of any premium, be reimbursed, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, for moneys paid out on account of the liability of the Idaho national guard. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to amend or modify any substantive provision of this title. No charge shall be made by the fund for administration of the guard’s liability hereunder.

Such statement shall list the amount of payments made and to whom and on whose account such payments are made, and shall be forwarded to the adjutant general of the state, who shall indorse thereon his approval of the statement and forward the same to the board of examiners.

      § 72-1002. Legislative purpose and intent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature hereby finds, determines and declares that victims of violent crime are often reduced to bereft and destitute circumstances as a result of the criminal acts perpetrated against them, that the financial or economic resources of such victims and their dependents are in many instances distressed or depleted as a result of injuries inflicted upon them by violent criminals.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the general social and economic welfare of such victims and their dependents is and ought to be intimately affected with the public interest, that the deplorable plight of these unfortunate citizens should not go unnoticed by our institutions and agencies of government.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature hereby further finds, determines and declares that it is to the benefit of all that victims of violence and their dependents be assisted financially and socially whenever possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature of this state to provide a method of compensating and assisting those persons within the state who are innocent victims of criminal acts and who suffer injury or death. To this end, it is the legislature’s intention to provide compensation for injuries suffered as a direct result of the criminal acts of other persons.

In a civil action in a court of this state arising out of criminally injurious conduct, the judge, on timely motion, shall direct the jury to return a special verdict indicating separately the amounts of the various items of damages awarded.

     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to provide a full salary to employees in certain dangerous occupations who have been injured on the job. The legislature finds that the rights and protections provided to peace officers and detention officers under this chapter constitute matters of statewide concern. Since these officers are employed in dangerous conditions, it is necessary that this chapter be applicable to all such officers wherever situated within the state of Idaho. In addition to the provisions of this chapter, state and local law enforcement agencies may provide additional monetary protections for their employees.

The training tax rate shall be equal to three percent (3%) of the taxable wage rate then in effect for each eligible standard-rated and deficit-rated employer. The training tax shall be due and payable at the same time and in the same manner as contributions.
    (8) The provisions of chapter 13, title 72, Idaho Code, which apply to the payment and collection of contributions, also apply to the payment and collection of the training tax, including the same calculations, assessments, methods of payment, penalties, interest, costs, liens, injunctive relief, collection procedures and refund procedures. The director of the department of labor is granted all rights, authority and prerogatives necessary to administer the provisions of this subsection. Moneys collected from an employer delinquent in paying the training tax shall first be applied to any penalties and interest imposed pursuant to the provisions of chapter 13, title 72, Idaho Code, and then pro rata to the training fund established in subsection (1) of this section. Any penalties and interest collected pursuant to this subsection shall be paid into the state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund, section 72-1348, Idaho Code, and any penalties or interest refunded under this subsection shall be paid from that same fund. Training taxes paid pursuant to this section shall not be credited to the employer’s experience rating account and may not be deducted by any employer from the wages of individuals in its employ. All training taxes shall be deposited in the clearing account of the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, for clearance only and shall not become part of such fund. After clearance, the moneys shall be deposited in the training fund. The director of the department of labor may authorize refunds of training taxes erroneously collected and deposited in the training fund.

         The first Unemployment Compensation Law was enacted at the third extra session of the twenty-third session of the State Legislature, 1936, S.L. 1937, ch. 12, p. 20, and was amended by S.L. 1937, chs. 9, 183, 187 and 188; S.L. 1939, chs. 202, 203 and 239; S.L. 1941, chs. 65, 175 and 182; and S.L. 1943, chs. 29, 68 and 92: such law as amended was repealed by S.L. 1945, chs. 203, § 11, which ch. 203 of S.L. 1945 enacted a second Unemployment Compensation Law in its place. This law, in turn, was repealed by § 79 of S.L. 1947, ch. 269. The law enacted by S.L. 1947, ch 269 is designated as the Employment Security Law.

         No new or additional fund was brought into existence by the state board of examiners in allowing a requisition for cash advances of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] pursuant to the amount of appropriation made by the legislature. Suppiger v. Enking, 60 Idaho 292, 91 P.2d 362 (1939).
        </p>
        <p>
         The extension of credit by the state, inhibited under the constitution, was credit extended to private sources to promote private schemes. The inherent and official governmental nature of the service, for which the expenditure was made and for which an advance was allowed, determined its character as not giving or loaning credit to the state. Suppiger v. Enking, 60 Idaho 292, 91 P.2d 362 (1939).

         Money paid out had to be passed upon by the state board of examiners. State ex rel. Taylor v. Robinson, 59 Idaho 485, 83 P.2d 983 (1938).
        </p>

        <p>
         The public policy of this state is as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious threat to the well-being of our people. Unemployment is a subject of national and state concern. This chapter addresses this problem by encouraging employers to offer stable employment and by systematically accumulating funds during periods of employment to pay benefits for periods of unemployment. The legislature declares that the general welfare of our citizens requires the enactment of this measure and sets aside unemployment reserves to be used for workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own.

        </p>
        <p>
         Despite an employer’s contention that the imposition of the unemployment compensation tax upon him was arbitrary, since neither he nor his employees received any benefit therefrom, indirect benefits were received from increasing the stability of the employer-employee climate throughout the state, as well as a reduced strain on the welfare system. But even assuming his assertion to be correct, employers are rated as to the number of their employees who receive fewest unemployment benefits, and, therefore, there is an attempt at least to require employers who are most responsible for involuntary unemployment to bear a higher burden of the cost.

        </p>

         The purpose of this act should not be thwarted in the name of uniformity by extending the meaning of the phrase “services performed in the employ” of an exempt organization to include services performed for all its sources of income.

        <p>
         The employment security act is social legislation, designed to alleviate economic insecurity and to relieve hardships resulting from involuntary unemployment. It was intended to provide benefits for those unemployed under prescribed conditions who are willing and able to work but unable to secure a suitable employment on the labor market. Johns v. S. H. Kress & Co., 78 Idaho 544, 307 P.2d 217 (1957).

        </p>
        <p>
         By adopting the employment security law, the legislature has sought to encourage stability of employment, and one of the methods which the legislature has adopted in accomplishing that purpose is to discourage voluntary termination of employment without “good cause.” Pyeatt v. Idaho State Univ., 98 Idaho 424, 565 P.2d 1381 (1977).
        </p>

         The Idaho employment security act was enacted to help alleviate the economic and social hardships caused by unemployment which did not result from the fault of the employee. Smith v. Department of Emp., 100 Idaho 520, 602 P.2d 18 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         If the purpose of the Idaho employment security act is to promote economic security and to provide benefits during periods of economic unemployment, such purpose is frustrated by a finding that, because an employee voluntarily left his employment prior to an effective firing date, that such leaving prevents the claimant from ever becoming eligible for benefits as of the date he became involuntarily unemployed.

        <p>
         Appellant made no employment contract with the farmer whose crop he was spraying. Such factor may in some instances be proper to consider, but whether labor is done directly for the farmer or by the employee of one engaged in spraying or dusting crops commercially is immaterial and must be considered farm or agricultural labor if it is in fact such. Florek v. Sparks Flying Serv., Inc., 83 Idaho 160, 359 P.2d 511 (1961).
        </p>
        <p>
         Employer was not entitled to utilize the “agricultural labor” exemption under this section because employer’s business of assembly and repair of agricultural sprinkler systems did not constitute “cultivating soil” or “raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodities”. Branchflower v. State, 128 Idaho 593, 917 P.2d 750 (1996).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although services rendered by agricultural employer’s business fell within the definition of “agricultural labor” under this section with respect to work done on employer’s own farm, and thus qualified for an exemption, the work performed by employer’s employees, on other farms, did not meet the “agricultural labor” definition, and with respect to those services employer was a covered employer and employee was entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits. Branchflower v. State, 128 Idaho 593, 917 P.2d 750 (1996).

         The fact that appellant is highly skilled as a pilot does not preclude him from engaging in farm or agricultural labor. A person whose general business or trade is covered by the employment security law has the same right to engage in agricultural labor and while so engaged is subject to the same law as a person who makes agriculture his exclusive occupation or business. Florek v. Sparks Flying Serv., Inc., 83 Idaho 160, 359 P.2d 511 (1961).
    Spraying or dusting of agricultural crops by whatever means is agricultural labor as that term is defined in the employment security law. Florek v. Sparks Flying Serv., Inc., 83 Idaho 160, 359 P.2d 511 (1961).

    In determining whether one employed to assist in fattening livestock for the market was performing “agricultural labor” within the meaning of the provision of the unemployment compensation law that the term “covered employment” should not include agricultural labor, the nature of the service rendered was controlling, and not the means by which the employer acquired title to the livestock.

         The processing of farm products, consisting in washing, sorting, grading, and packing and crating them so as to make them marketable, but involving no physical or chemical change in substance or structure, constituted “agricultural labor” within the meaning of unemployment compensation law, and hence the employer was not liable for contributions under the law upon wages paid for such work, whether the products processed were purchased by the employer or received on consignment to be processed and sold, a charge for processing and a brokerage charge being deducted from the sale price before paying the balance to the producer.

         It was permissible for this section to exclude daytime but not nighttime students from eligibility for unemployment benefits, since the legislature could rationally conclude that daytime work is far more plentiful than nighttime work and that consequently daytime students restrict the range of jobs open to them; and the fact that the classification is imperfect because some daytime students actually find job opportunities more numerous at night does not invalidate the statute under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Idaho Dep’t of Emp. v. Smith, 434 U.S. 100, 98 S. Ct. 327, 54 L. Ed. 2d 324 (1977).

         A person who attends classes during the day will qualify for unemployment compensation under the employment security law by demonstrating that he is primarily a member of the work force because of the amount of time, and not the time of the day, spent at work. Kerr v. Department of Emp., 97 Idaho 385, 545 P.2d 473 (1976).
    This section did not preclude claimant from receipt of unemployment compensation benefits because of her attendance at early morning classes at Boise State University. Smith v. Department of Emp., 100 Idaho 520, 602 P.2d 18 (1979).

         The language of subsection (a) [now (1)] of this section permits receipt of benefits by an otherwise eligible claimant whose enrollment in school does not affect the claimant’s availability for suitable full-time employment. Smith v. Department of Emp., 100 Idaho 520, 602 P.2d 18 (1979).

         The general rule appears to be that student-claimants who are held eligible for unemployment benefits are those who place availability for work ahead of their schooling and demonstrate a willingness to change class schedules or drop out of school if a job conflict makes such necessary. The demonstrated inquiry is whether the claimant is genuinely attached to the labor market or principally interested in obtaining an education. Davenport v.

         Despite an employer’s contention that the imposition of the unemployment compensation tax upon him was arbitrary since neither he nor his employees received any benefit therefrom, indirect benefits were received from increasing the stability of the employer-employee climate throughout the state, as well as a reduced strain on the welfare system. But, even assuming his assertion to be correct, employers are rated as to the number of their employees who receive fewest unemployment benefits and, therefore, there is an attempt at least to require employers who are most responsible for involuntary unemployment to bear a higher burden of the cost.

        <p>
         The cleaning and processing of edible beans and peas is agricultural labor and is exempt from employment security payroll tax as “agricultural labor” even though the company purchases some of the peas and beans, where the company imposed a charge on the farmer for processing and cleaning whether beans and peas were held for redelivery or purchase. Chester B. Brown Co. v. Employment Sec. Agency, 78 Idaho 166, 299 P.2d 487 (1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         Appellant made no employment contract with the farmer whose crop he was spraying. Such factor may in some instances be proper to consider, but whether labor is done directly for the farmer or by the employee of one engaged in spraying or dusting crops commercially is immaterial, and must be considered farm or agricultural labor if it is in fact such. Florek v. Sparks Flying Serv., Inc., 83 Idaho 160, 359 P.2d 511 (1961).
        </p>
        <p>
         Spraying or dusting of agricultural crops by whatever means is agricultural labor as that term is defined in the employment security law. Florek v. Sparks Flying Serv., Inc., 83 Idaho 160, 359 P.2d 511 (1961).
    The fact that appellant is highly skilled as a pilot does not preclude him from engaging in farm or agricultural labor. A person whose general business or trade is covered by the employment security law has the same right to engage in agricultural labor and while so engaged is subject to the same law as a person who makes agriculture his exclusive occupation or business. Florek v. Sparks Flying Serv., Inc., 83 Idaho 160, 359 P.2d 511 (1961).

         Although a family-owned corporation engaged in the slaughter, processing, and packaging of chickens for market obtained most of its chickens from a hatching corporation owned by the same family, such corporation was not engaged in agriculture as defined by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c13s72-1304" target="_self">§ 72-1304</a></cite>. Lowe v. Bertie’s Poultry Farms, Inc., 91 Idaho 695, 429 P.2d 427 (1967).

        <p>
         Where it is evident that the primary purpose of employer’s poultry business is to produce, hatch, raise and sell poultry, and the various components of the corporation constitute a single integrated farming venture, and that the processing plant is incidental to the total farming enterprise, an employee of the processing plant cannot qualify under the employment security act.

Similarly, the company’s practice of dictating who paid for insurance was part of the relationship between the company and its workers, but shed no light on which party controlled how actual work was performed.

         The particular provisions of this section which single out those who contract with agents for the distribution of meat products, vegetable products, fruit products, bakery products, beverages or laundry or dry cleaning services, and denominates them as employers who are required to pay unemployment compensation tax are unconstitutional on their face and as applied, since equal protection of the laws is denied, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Idaho Const., Art. 1, § 2.

         Where franchisee, who owned franchise rights to operate income tax preparation offices, contracted with persons for the management and operation of such offices whereby franchisee retained power to promulgate policies and procedures for the conduct of the business and to control managers in the performance of their work, franchisee was an employer and the managers were not engaged in an independently established business.

         Industrial commission’s finding that the claimant was not engaged in an independent trade or business was supported by evidence that claimant did not have the right to hire assistants but instead, when she found it necessary to be away from work, sought employer’s approval, that claimant would then trade shifts with another worker or employer would find a substitute for her, that claimant did not own or furnish any of the major items of equipment, that neither employer or claimant was contractually liable to the other for a peremptory termination of the business relationship, that claimant did not advertise her services or collect any fees from the parents for the services she performed but was paid on a regular monthly basis, and that employer could terminate her employment at will. Hill v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 108 Idaho 583, 701 P.2d 203 (1985).

         As defined, “covered employment” sweeps within its purview employee and independent contractor alike; it is only through later provisions of this section that an independent contractor may “exempt out” of the purview of this term.

         The general test of whether the right to control is sufficient to give rise to the relationship of employer and employee is whether the control extends to the details of the work, the manner, method or mode of doing it, the means by which it is to be accomplished, or, specifically, the details, manner, means or method of doing the work, as contrasted with the result thereof. J.R. Simplot Co. v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 110 Idaho 762, 718 P.2d 1200 (1986).
    The term “covered employment” as used in the employment security act is an expansive term. King v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 110 Idaho 312, 715 P.2d 982 (1986).

        <p>
         For an employer to prove that a worker’s services are exempt from the broad definition of “covered employment,” the employer must show that the worker is not an employee, but is an independent contractor who has been and will continue to be free from control or direction in the performance of his work, both under his contract of service and in fact, and is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.

         Where the employer hired employees to assist him in a truck washing business, no worker was required to furnish any equipment for the job other than personal clothing, the employer showed the worker how to perform the washing work and how to complete paperwork, no liability existed between the workers and the employer for terminating the relationship without notice, the employer allowed the workers to set when they would quit working and allowed them to have others substitute for them, workers were paid for each truck washed regardless of the amount of time spent washing the vehicle, and received 30 percent of the gross amount billed to the truck driver, the services of the workers were “covered employment,” since they were subject to the employer’s direction and control and were not engaged in an independent business, their payment constituted wages for unemployment insurance purposes, and the employer was a covered employer.

         Several factors may be considered in determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists. Among such factors are (1) the way the corporation represented its relationship to the worker prior to the present litigation, including its representations of the IRS; (2) statements made to the department of employment; (3) method of payment, in particular whether federal, state and FICA taxes are withheld from paychecks; and (4) whether certain benefits (life or health insurance) are provided the worker at the corporation’s expense.

         Where “contract laborers” of the Idaho bicentennial commission who were hired to do specialty tasks in a restoration project were not closely supervised, worked their own hours and brought their own hand tools to work, they were independent contractors and therefore the commission was not liable for unemployment insurance contributions.

         Prior to the effective date of the 1974 amendment which added a specific exemption concerning real estate salesmen (dropped by 1977 amendment), the services provided by commissioned real estate salesmen for real estate brokers were exempted from the definition of “covered employment,” since under the state real estate law,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.54.html#t54c20s54-2021" target="_blank">§ 54-2021 </a></cite>et seq., real estate brokers and real estate salesmen are engaged in separate professions.

         Where real estate salesmen were free to make their own hours and develop their own techniques of salesmanship, were paid only by commission regardless of the amount of time they worked and no deductions were withheld from the commissions, where they were free to negotiate deals with other brokers and salesmen and where they frequently possessed substantial real estate, they were engaged in an “independently established trade, occupation, profession or business” under subsection (d)(1)(B) [now (4)(b)] of this section and their services were not “covered employment.” Department of Emp. v. Bake Young Realty, 98 Idaho 182, 560 P.2d 504 (1977).
    It was reasonable for the legislature to exempt agricultural employers, but not exempt seasonal lawn sprinkler installation employers from the payment of unemployment compensation taxes, since the legislature may reasonably have determined that agricultural employment is inherently more unstable than nonagricultural employment and hence directed its efforts toward the nonagricultural market as being more likely to succeed while opting to deal with the agricultural labor market at a later time.

         The relation of principal and independent contractor was established where method of payment for services performed was by agreed percentage of the dollar volume of sales, there was no control of the salesman by the corporation nor of his equipment, salesman furnished his transportation at his own expense, no direction was made as to hours or days worked, salesman had no responsibility for funds paid by patrons for stocks as these moneys were paid over in their entirety to the corporation which forwarded the money for the stock transfer and at regular intervals paid the established commissions.

         A truck driver who owned his own truck-tractor and pulled trailers on a commission basis was an independent contractor and not an employee since he had the authority to hire subordinates, exercised this authority frequently, owned the major item of equipment used in hauling, and was completely responsible for all expenses on the tractor including insurance, repairs, and maintenance.

         As to whether a worker is engaged in an independent trade or business, the following factors are to be considered: (1) whether the worker had authority to hire subordinates; (2) whether the worker owned major items of equipment; and (3) whether either party would be liable to the other for a peremptory termination of the business relationship.

         Moving of sprinkler pipe is not work which demands particular skill, qualification or training, nor does it entail the use of highly specialized or expensive equipment and where the only items of equipment supplied by the workers were gloves, boots, and aprons, while all of the major equipment for the irrigation operation was supplied by the employer and the involvement of the pipe movers was only a part of the entire irrigation operation, the fact that employer’s treatment of the pipe movers might be different than that typical of an employer-employee relationship did not make the service they provided “an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business”; accordingly, there was no error in the commission’s determination that employee had not established entitlement to an exemption from the application of the employment security provisions, under subdivision (d)(1) [now (4)(a)] of this section.

         A bakery operated and controlled by a convention or association of churches was insofar as the employees of the bakery were concerned, operated primarily for religious purposes; hence, their services were not “covered employment” under the Idaho unemployment security law. Department of Emp. v. Champion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., 100 Idaho 53, 592 P.2d 1370 (1979).

         Even if an organization meets the requirements of this section so as to qualify for an exemption from paying state unemployment insurance taxes, it is not exempt under the Idaho employment security law if it is required to pay the taxes imposed by the federal unemployment tax act, 26 U.S.C.S. § 3301 et seq.

         Where the Idaho Allied Christian Forces (IACF) was a separately incorporated organization of persons who paid an annual membership fee and stated their belief in Jesus Christ, where the IACF was distinct from the various churches which supported its principles, and where the IACF was operated, supervised, and controlled by an independent board of directors consisting of 15 people who were elected annually by the members of the organization, the IACF was not operated, controlled or principally supported by an “association of churches” within the meaning of this section so as to qualify for an exemption from state unemployment insurance taxes, nor was IACF an exempt organization of the type described in subdivision (g)(1)(i) [now (7)(a)] of this section.

        <p>
         The religious school was operated primarily for religious purposes and was principally supported by an association of churches under this section, where several different churches were united by their relationship to the school, the school had a religious mission and purpose, and the school could not exist as a private school without the moral support of those several churches.

        <p>
         Where the purpose behind the religious school was not so much to declare a specific body of doctrine, as it was to provide students with a religious education that supported the body of doctrine with which a wide number of fundamentalist churches could agree, there was no evidence of a definite ecclesiastical government nor a membership unassociated with other churches, and the school did not use ordained ministers, the religious school was not a church for the purposes of this section.

         To accommodate the legislature’s intent, as spelled out by this section, the department of employment [now department of labor] must allow a procedure for the director to consider the employer’s explanation for becoming delinquent. For those delinquencies that are minor, the department must further decide if the employer has acted in good faith and if removal of the employer’s favorable tax status would be inequitable. Holly Care Center v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 110 Idaho 76, 714 P.2d 45 (1986).
    It is evident that the legislature intended a distinction to be made between employers with major tax delinquencies and employers with minor tax delinquencies; those employers with minor delinquencies may be excused by the director of employment [now director of department of labor] from their errors and allowed to continue in the favorable tax bracket where there is a showing that they have acted in good faith and that removing the favorable tax status would be inequitable.

         A denial of a reduced rating to an employer earned through a period close to ten years would be inequitable upon a showing that the failure to submit the required tax reports to the employment security agency by the employer as required was in a minor nature, due to change in bookkeepers, the employer having acted in good faith and never before through said period years having been delinquent, always maintaining a special account in which tax accruals were deposited, further that the said employer acted promptly upon discovery of the nonsubmission of the required report.

         Compensation Not Included as Wages.
        </h5>
        <p>
         Wages include all remunerations, including commissions, for personal services but do not include those allowances or reimbursements for reasonable or ordinary expenses incurred for business reasons which the employee includes in itemized statements to his employer and which are clearly differentiated between the employee’s wages and business expenses in the employer’s records.

         Plaintiff appealed the decision of the industrial commission affirming a determination that services performed by plaintiff’s sales representatives came within the scope of employment covered by unemployment compensation and that commissions paid by plaintiff to its sales representatives were wages for employment security fund contribution purposes. The industrial commission’s findings were not supported by substantial and competent evidence. Thus, the order of the industrial commission was vacated and remanded. Vendx Mktg. Co. v. Department of Emp., 122 Idaho 890, 841 P.2d 420 (1992).

         Claimant, a carpenter, upon termination of his employment by reason of the completion of the project, filed claim for unemployment benefits and was thereafter paid benefits. Excluding a short employment interval and vacation period, the unemployed carpenter commenced constructing a dwelling on two lots he owned, doing this in his spare time while unemployed and such was held to be an increment of his estate equal to, if not greater than, the wages he would have been required to pay other artisans to work for him and he was held fully employed and receiving actual wages, and therefore not entitled to compensation benefits, but since he had received them in good faith was not required to repay benefits received.

The following provisions of this subsection shall be subject to a contingency annuity option. If an employee dies on or after the date ten (10) years prior to his normal retirement date, it will be assumed that he retired on the first day of the month following his date of death, and his beneficiary shall receive, beginning on the assumed retirement date, one hundred twenty (120) monthly pension payments. The amount of monthly pension payable will be based on the credit accrued to that time and the employee’s assumed earlier retirement age. If death occurs after retirement but before one hundred twenty (120) monthly pension payments have been made, the monthly pension will be continued to his beneficiary until a total of one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments have been made.

Upon agreement between the director and state controller, amounts in the benefit account may be transferred to a revolving account established and maintained in a depository bank from which the director may provide for the payment of benefits and refunds. Moneys so transferred shall be deposited subject to the same requirements as provided with respect to moneys in the clearing and benefit accounts in subsection (2) of this section. Any balance of moneys requisitioned from the federal unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account or revolving account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were requisitioned, may be utilized for the payment of benefits and refunds during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the director, shall be redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States to the credit of this state’s account in the federal unemployment trust fund.
    (4) Reed Act Moneys. Reed act moneys credited to this state’s account in the federal unemployment trust fund by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section 903 of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1103) may be requisitioned and used for the payment of benefits and for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter. Moneys may only be requisitioned and used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter if the expenses are incurred and the money is requisitioned after the enactment of a specific appropriation by the legislature which specifies the purposes for which such money is appropriated and the amounts appropriated therefor. Such appropriation is subject to the following conditions:

         </li>
         <li id="t72c13s72-1346ol13b">
          The amount which may be obligated at any time may not exceed the amount by which the aggregate of the amounts transferred to the account of this state pursuant to section 903 of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1103) exceeds the aggregate of the amounts used by this state and charged against the amounts transferred to the account of this state. For the purposes of this subsection, amounts obligated for administrative purposes pursuant to an appropriation shall be chargeable against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>

      </h3>
      <ol>
       <li id="t72c13s72-1347Aol11">
        There is established in the state treasury a special trust fund, separate and apart from all other public funds of this state, to be known as the employment security reserve fund, hereinafter “reserve fund.” Except as provided herein, all proceeds from the reserve tax defined in subsection (2) of this section shall be paid into the reserve fund. The moneys in the reserve fund may be used by the director for loans to the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, as security for loans from the federal unemployment insurance trust fund, and for the repayment of any interest-bearing advances, including interest, made under title XII of the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 1321 through 1324, and shall be available to the director for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this section. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of the reserve fund and shall invest said moneys in accordance with law. The state treasurer shall disburse the moneys from the reserve fund in accordance with the directions of the director.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c13s72-1347Aol12">
        A reserve tax is imposed on all covered employers required to pay contributions pursuant to section 72-1350, Idaho Code, except deficit-rated employers who have been assigned a taxable wage rate from deficit rate class six pursuant to section 72-1350(8)(a), Idaho Code. The reserve tax shall be due and payable at the same time and in the same manner as contributions. If the reserve fund is less than one percent (1%) of state taxable wages in the penultimate year as of September 30 of the preceding calendar year, the reserve tax rate for all eligible, standard-rated and deficit-rated employers shall be equal to the taxable wage rate then in effect less the assigned contribution rate and training tax rate. The provisions of this chapter which apply to the payment and collection of contributions also apply to the payment and collection of the reserve tax, including the same calculations, assessments, method of payment, penalties, interest, costs, liens, injunctive relief, collection procedures and refund procedures. In the administration of the provisions of this section and the collection of the reserve tax, the director is granted all rights, authority, and prerogatives granted the director under the provisions of this chapter. Moneys collected from an employer delinquent in paying contributions and reserve taxes shall first be applied to pay any penalty and interest imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and shall then be applied pro rata to pay delinquent contributions to the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, and delinquent reserve taxes to the reserve fund pursuant to this section. Any interest and penalties collected pursuant to this subsection shall be paid into the state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund, section 72-1348, Idaho Code, and any interest or penalties refunded under this subsection shall be paid out of that same fund. Reserve taxes paid pursuant to this subsection may not be deducted in whole or in part by any employer from the wages of individuals in its employ. All reserve taxes collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the clearing account of the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, for clearance only and shall not become part of such fund. After clearance, the moneys shall be deposited in the reserve fund established in subsection (1) of this section. No reserve tax shall be imposed for any calendar year if, as of September 30 of the preceding calendar year, the balance of the reserve fund equals or exceeds one percent (1%) of the state taxable wages for the penultimate calendar year, or exceeds forty-nine percent (49%) of the actual balance of the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code.

        The interest earned from investment of the reserve fund shall be deposited in a fund established in the state treasurer’s office, to be known as the department of labor special administration fund, hereinafter “special administration fund.” The moneys in the special administration fund shall be held separate and apart from all other public funds of this state. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of this fund and may invest said moneys in accordance with law. Any interest earned on said moneys shall be deposited in the special administration fund.

        Liability for contributions and election of reimbursements. A nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall pay contributions under the provisions of section 72-1349, Idaho Code, unless it elects, in accordance with this section, to pay to the director an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits paid and the amount paid for extended benefits for which the department is not reimbursed by the federal government, for any reason including, but not limited to, payments made as a result of a determination or payments erroneously paid, or paid as a result of a determination of eligibility, which is subsequently reversed if said payment or any portion thereof was made as a result of wages earned in the employ of such organization or entity.

Where such benefits are paid utilizing wages paid by two (2) or more employers, the portion of benefits to be repaid by the organization or entity shall be its proportionate share.

The director shall require adjustments to be made in the bond filed as deemed appropriate. When upward adjustments are required, the adjusted bond shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed.

        Nonprofit organizations and governmental entities excepted. Financing of benefits for workers assigned by a professional employer to a nonprofit organization or a governmental entity shall be paid as provided in section 72-1349A, Idaho Code. Financing of benefits for workers assigned by a professional employer to any entity other than a nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this section.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c13s72-1349Bol12">
        Liability for contributions. Unless a professional employer meets the minimum requirements of this chapter, its client shall remain liable as a covered employer for any payments due under the provisions of this chapter. During the term of a professional employer arrangement, a professional employer is liable for the payment of all moneys due pursuant to this chapter as a result of wages paid to employees assigned to a client company, except compensation paid to sole proprietors or partners in the client company.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c13s72-1349Bol13">
        Joint and several liability. A client is jointly and severally liable for any unpaid moneys due under the provisions of this chapter from the professional employer for wages paid to workers assigned to the client.

       <li id="t72c13s72-1349Bol14">
        Reporting requirements. The professional employer shall report and make all payments under its state employer account number. The professional employer shall keep separate records and submit separate quarterly wage reports for each of its clients. The professional employer shall pay contributions for its clients collectively using the professional employer’s contribution rate unless it elects to pay the contribution for certain clients individually in which instance the contribution shall be paid using the individual client’s contribution rate.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c13s72-1349Bol15">
        Interested party. As between a professional employer and its client, the professional employer company shall be deemed to be the interested party for purposes of section 72-1323, Idaho Code, and all proceedings to determine rights to benefits under the provisions of this chapter.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c13s72-1349Bol16">
        Temporary workers. The provisions of this section do not apply to an entity that provides temporary workers on a temporary help basis, provided that the entity is liable as the employer for all payments due under the provisions of this chapter as a result of wages paid to those temporary workers.

       <li id="t72c13s72-1349Bol17">
        Rebuttable presumption. When a professional employer assigns workers to only one (1) client and its affiliates, there is a rebuttable presumption that the client entered into a professional employer arrangement to avoid calculation of the proper taxable wage rate. If the professional employer fails to rebut this presumption, the director, pursuant to section 72-1353, Idaho Code, shall issue an administrative determination of coverage holding the client to be the covered employer for purposes of this chapter.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c13s72-1349Bol18">
        A client ceasing to pay wages. Whenever a client ceases to pay wages, such client shall be subject to termination of its employer account and experience rating records in the same manner as any other employer, in accordance with the provisions of sections 72-1351 and 72-1352, Idaho Code. If a client which has ceased to pay wages subsequently becomes subject to this chapter because it resumes paying wages, it will be assigned the appropriate experience rate in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1351, Idaho Code.
    (9) Succession of experience factors. Whenever a professional employer arrangement is entered, the separate account and experience factors of payroll and reserve shall be transferred to the professional employer for the purpose of determining the professional employer’s contribution rate to be paid on behalf of the client. Upon the expiration or termination of the professional employer arrangement, so much of the professional employer’s separate account and experience factors of payroll and reserve as is attributable to the client shall be transferred to the terminating client for the purpose of determining the client’s subsequent rate of contribution. In the event the professional employer elects to pay the client’s contribution separately as provided in subsection (4) of this section, then the client’s experience factors of payroll and reserve shall remain with the client employer for the duration of the professional employer arrangement.

For purposes of this section, the exemptions from covered employment in sections 72-1316A(5) and (9), Idaho Code, shall be applicable to services performed in the employ of an Indian tribe.

Such bond shall be in force for a period of not less than two (2) years, and shall be renewed not less frequently than two (2) year intervals for as long as the Indian tribe or tribal unit continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The director may require adjustments to be made in the bond filed. When upward adjustments are required, the adjusted bond shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed. Failure by an Indian tribe or tribal unit covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments due, together with interest and penalties as provided in section 72-1354, Idaho Code, shall render the surety liable on said bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was a liable organization.

    (a) Any Indian tribe that loses the option to make payments in lieu of contributions due to late payment or nonpayment as described in this subsection (5) of this section, shall have such option reinstated if, after a period of one (1) year, all contributions have been made timely, provided no contributions, payments in lieu of contributions for benefits paid, penalties or interest remain outstanding.

        All remuneration for personal services as defined in section 72-1328, Idaho Code, equal to the average annual wage in covered employment for the penultimate calendar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of one hundred dollars ($100), or the amount of taxable wage base specified in the federal unemployment tax act, whichever is higher, shall be the taxable wage base for purposes of this chapter.

        Prior to December 31 of each year, the director shall determine the taxable wage rates for the following calendar year for all covered employers, except cost reimbursement employers, in accordance with this section. If the desired fund size multiplier set forth in subsection (3) of this section is revised with an effective date that is prior to January 1 of the following year, the director shall issue adjusted taxable wage rates as soon as practicable and in accordance with the revised multiplier’s effective date. Employers shall receive a credit against future taxes under this act for any overpayments resulting from tax payments made before the amended taxable wage rates are adjusted.

        An average high cost ratio shall be determined by calculating the average of the three (3) highest benefit cost rates in the twenty (20) year period ending with the preceding year. For the purposes of this section, the “benefit cost rate” is the total annual benefits paid, including the state’s share of extended benefits but excluding the federal share of extended benefits and cost-reimbursable benefits, divided by the total annual covered wages excluding cost-reimbursable wages. The resulting average high cost ratio is multiplied by the desired fund size multiplier and the result, for the purposes of this section, is referred to as the “average high cost multiple” (AHCM). The desired fund size multiplier shall be eight tenths (0.8) and shall increase to nine tenths (0.9) on and after January 1, 2012; to one (1) on and after January 1, 2013; to one and one-tenth (1.1) on and after January 1, 2014; to one and two-tenths (1.2) on and after January 1, 2015; to one and three-tenths (1.3) on and after January 1, 2016; to one and four-tenths (1.4) on and after January 1, 2017; and to one and three-tenths (1.3) on and after January 1, 2018.

         This section was amended by Section 66 of S.L. 1998, ch. 1, effective retroactively to January 1, 1998. In subsection (7), the previous taxable wage rate of 5.6 under Schedule VIII for deficit employers in rate class 3 was overstruck, and the new taxable wage rate of 5.4 was simultaneously underscored and overstruck. Also in subsection (7), the previous taxable wage rate of 6.0 under Schedule IX for deficit employers in rate class 3 was overstruck and the new taxable wage rate of 5.6 was simultaneously underscored and overstruck. Because these new tax rates were simultaneously underscored and overstruck, they are not included in this section.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2011 amendment, by ch. 111, in subsection (3), deleted “of eight-tenths (0.8)” following “fund size multiplier” in the third sentence and added the last sentence.
    This section was amended by two 2016 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2016 amendment, by ch. 158, in subsection (9), substituted “notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code” for “delivery or mailing of the notice thereof to his last known address” and similar language in the second sentence and fourth sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2016 amendment, by ch. 280, in subsection (2), deleted the proviso at the end of the introductory paragraph, and paragraphs (a) and (b), which read: “provided however, and notwithstanding any other provision of the employment security law to the contrary, for calendar years 2005 and 2006, the taxable wage rates for all covered employers except cost reimbursement employers shall be determined as follows: (a) For calendar year 2005, the taxable wage rate shall be determined using a base tax rate of one and fifty hundredths percent (1.50%); (b) For calendar year 2006, the taxable wage rate shall be determined using a base tax rate of one and sixty-seven hundredths percent (1.67%) unless, at any time prior to September 30, 2005, the actual balance in the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, is fifty percent (50%) or less than the actual balance in the reserve fund, section 72-1347A, Idaho Code, in which case the taxable wage rate shall be determined using a base tax rate calculated in accordance with subsection (5) of this section”; and in subsection (5), substituted “six-tenths percent (0.6%) and shall not exceed three and four-tenths percent (3.4%)” for “sixty-three hundredths percent (0.63%) and shall not exceed three and thirty-six hundredths percent (3.36%)”; and, in subsection (7), in the Standard-Rated Employers table, under Maximum Taxable Wage Rate, substituted “3.4%” for “3.360%”.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2018 amendment, by ch. 1, added the last two sentences in subsection (2) and substituted “one and three-tenths (1.3)” for “one and five-tenths (1.5)” near the end of subsection (3).

       (5)(a) Whenever any individual or type of organization, whether or not a covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, in any manner succeeds to, or acquires all or substantially all, of the business of an employer who at the time of acquisition was a covered employer, and in respect to whom the director finds that the business of the predecessor is continued solely by the successor, the separate experience rating account of the predecessor shall, upon the joint application of the predecessor and the successor within the one hundred eighty (180) days after such acquisition and approval by the director, be transferred to the successor employer for the purpose of determining such successor’s liability and taxable wage rate, and any successor who was not an employer on the date of acquisition shall, as of such date, become a covered employer as defined in this chapter. Such one hundred eighty (180) day period may be extended at the discretion of the director.

       (b) Whenever any individual or type of organization, whether or not a covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, in any manner succeeds to, or acquires, part of the business of an employer who at the time of acquisition was a covered employer, and such portion of the business is continued by the successor, so much of the separate experience rating account of the predecessor as is attributable to the portion of the business transferred, as determined on a pro rata basis in the same ratio that the wages of covered employees properly allocable to the transferred portion of the business bears to the payroll of the predecessor in the last four (4) completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the date of transfer, shall, upon the joint application of the predecessor and the successor within one hundred eighty (180) days after such acquisition and approval by the director, be transferred to the successor employer for the purpose of determining such successor’s liability and taxable wage rate, and any successor who was not an employer on the date of acquisition shall, as of such date, become a covered employer as defined in this chapter. Such one hundred eighty (180) day period may be extended at the discretion of the director.

      <p>
       (c)(i) If the successor was a covered employer prior to the date of the acquisition of all or a part of the predecessor’s business, his taxable wage rate, effective the first day of the calendar quarter immediately following the date of acquisition, shall be a newly computed rate based on the combined experience of the predecessor and successor, the resulting rate remaining in effect the balance of the rate year.
    (ii) If the successor was not a covered employer prior to the date of the acquisition of all or a part of the predecessor’s business, his rate shall be the rate applicable to the predecessor with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition, but if there were more than one (1) predecessor, the successor’s rate shall be a newly computed rate based on the combined experience of the predecessors, becoming effective immediately after the date of acquisition, and shall remain in effect the balance of the rate year.
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) For purposes of this section, an employer’s experience rating account shall consist of the actual contribution, benefit and taxable payroll experience of the employer and any amounts due from the employer under this chapter. When a transferred experience rating account includes amounts due from the employer under this chapter, both the predecessor employer and the successor employer shall be jointly and severally liable for those amounts.

        <p>
         First experience rate of employer in 1947 and any year thereafter is determined by deleting any benefit payments made to any of its employees discharged for cause since December 31, 1939. In re Potlatch Forests, Inc., 72 Idaho 291, 240 P.2d 242 (1952).
        </p>
        <p>
         In proceeding by employer to determine 1949 experience rate, it was error to strike payroll records of employer from the evidence, where agency had destroyed its records covering years of 1939 to 1948. In re Potlatch Forests, Inc., 72 Idaho 291, 240 P.2d 242 (1952).
        </p>
        <p>
         New corporation, which took over one of the stores operated by old corporation, was entitled to rating of old corporation, where the new corporation’s stockholders were the same as the old, the business continued at the old location, and the management was the same. In re Okay Shopping Ctr., Inc., 77 Idaho 524, 296 P.2d 1031 (1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         A denial of a reduced rating to an employer earned through a period close to ten years would be inequitable upon a showing that the failure to submit the required tax reports to the employment security agency by the employer as required was in minor nature, due to a change in bookkeepers, the employer having acted in good faith and never before through said period of years had been delinquent, always maintaining a special account in which tax accruals were deposited, further that the said employer acted promptly upon discovery of the nonsubmission of the required report.

         Failure of employer to file application for redetermination of 1947 rate was not binding where it protested that erroneous charges had been used in determination of rate, if rate in 1947 was 1.1 the lowest possible rate under the statute.

         By exercising his authority in the execution of his statutory duties by making the determination of whether or not an employer is a “covered employer,” the director did not assume or usurp judicial powers and functions. Further the employer was afforded an opportunity to be heard and a right of appeal to the industrial accident board and an appeal from that board to the supreme court. Such legislation did not attempt to give such finality to the determination made by the administrative agency that property and constitutional rights of citizens might be conclusively determined without right to adequate judicial review.

          A claimant shall not be denied regular unemployment benefits under any provision of this chapter relating to availability for work, active search for work or refusal to accept work, solely because the claimant is seeking only part-time work, if the department determines that a majority of the weeks of work in the claimant’s base period were for less than full-time work. For the purpose of this subsection [paragraph], “seeking only part-time work” is defined as seeking work that has comparable hours to the claimant’s part-time work experience in the base period, except that a claimant must be available for at least twenty (20) hours of work per week.

        The claimant’s unemployment is not due to his failure without good cause to apply for available suitable work or to accept suitable work when offered to him. The longer a claimant has been unemployed, the more willing he must be to seek other types of work and accept work at a lower rate of pay.

        In determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual, the degree of risk involved to his health, safety, morals, physical fitness, experience, training, past earnings, length of unemployment and prospects for obtaining local employment in his customary occupation, the distance of the work from his residence, and other pertinent factors shall be considered. No employment shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work or to hold himself available for work under any of the following conditions:

For purposes of this subsection, the term “suitable employment” means work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual’s past employment, and wages for such work are not less than eighty percent (80%) of the average weekly wage in the individual’s past employment.
    (10) A claimant shall not be eligible to receive benefits for any week with respect to which it is found that his unemployment is due to a labor dispute; provided, that this subsection shall not apply if it is shown that:

For the purposes of this subsection, a “declining occupation” is one where there is a lack of sufficient current demand in the claimant’s labor market area for the occupational skills for which the claimant is qualified by training and experience or current physical or mental capacity and the lack of employment opportunities is expected to continue for an extended period of time, or the claimant’s occupation is one for which there is a seasonal variation in demand in the labor market and the claimant has no other skills for which there is current demand.

The claimant shall also be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any week in which he owes the department an overpayment, civil penalty, or interest resulting from a determination that he willfully made a false statement or willfully failed to report a material fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       (13) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits if his principal occupation is self-employment.

      <p>
       (14) A claimant who has been found ineligible for benefits under the provisions of subsection (5), (6), (7) or (9) of this section shall reestablish his eligibility by having obtained bona fide work and received wages therefor in an amount of at least fourteen (14) times his weekly benefit amount.

       (b) If the services performed during less than one-half (1/2) of any contract period by an individual for an educational institution are in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity, none of the service shall be deemed to be in such capacity.

       (16) No claimant is eligible to receive benefits in two (2) successive benefit years unless, after the beginning of the first benefit year during which he received benefits, he performed service and earned an amount equal to not less than six (6) times the weekly benefit amount established during the first benefit year.
    (17)(a) Benefits based on wages earned for services performed in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution shall not be paid for any week of unemployment commencing during the period between two (2) successive academic years, or during a similar period between two (2) terms, whether or not successive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual’s contract, to any individual who performs such services in the first academic year (or term) and has a contract to perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second academic year or term, or has been given reasonable assurance that such a contract will be offered.

         Findings of board are not conclusive on appeal, if board does not hear or see the witnesses. Mandes v. Employment Sec. Agency, 74 Idaho 23, 255 P.2d 1049 (1953).
        </p>
        <p>
         The condition of claimant’s health and ability to work is a question of fact for the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] whose finding based on substantial and competent evidence will not be disturbed on review. Wolfgram v. Employment Sec. Agency, 77 Idaho 298, 291 P.2d 279 (1955); Turner v. Boise Lodge No. 310, 77 Idaho 465, 295 P.2d 256 (1956); Ankrum v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 274, 361 P.2d 795 (1961); Ramsey v. Employment Sec. Agency, 85 Idaho 395, 379 P.2d 797 (1963); Hudson v. Hecla Mining Co., 86 Idaho 447, 387 P.2d 893 (1963); Czarlinsky v. Employment Sec. Agency, 87 Idaho 65, 390 P.2d 822 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         Insofar as the finding of the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] reverses the determination of the examiners that claimant, a federal employee, resigned, they were in error but the findings do support the conclusion that claimant resigned for good cause; therefore, since the final judgment or order of the lower tribunal was correct but entered upon an erroneous theory, the judgment or order will be confirmed by the appellate court upon the correct theory. Saulls v. Employment Sec. Agency, 85 Idaho 212, 377 P.2d 789 (1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal from decisions of the industrial commission, the scope of review is limited to questions of law, and the commission’s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal when they are supported by substantial though conflicting evidence. Meyer v. Skyline Mobile Homes, 99 Idaho 754, 589 P.2d 89 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a second hearing’s examiner and the industrial commission lacked the power to adjudicate the issue of a claimant’s alleged fabrication, the orders of the industrial commission would be reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Luskin v. Department of Emp., 100 Idaho 584, 602 P.2d 947 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where supported by substantial and competent — although conflicting — evidence, the findings reached by the commission will be upheld regardless of whether an appellate court may have reached a different conclusion. Hopkins v. Pneumotech, Inc., 152 Idaho 611, 272 P.3d 1242 (2012).

        <p>
         Availability test is met by claimant if he shows he is able, ready, and willing to accept and is seeking suitable work at a point where an available labor market exists. Eytchison v. Employment Sec. Agency, 77 Idaho 448, 294 P.2d 593 (1956); Ellis v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 95, 358 P.2d 396 (1961); Claim of Sapp, 75 Idaho 65, 266 P.2d 1027 (1954).

        <p>
         Claimant was not available for work where he left large city in favor of a small town, where labor opportunities were practically nonexistent. Claim of Sapp, 75 Idaho 65, 266 P.2d 1027 (1954).
        </p>
        <p>
         Claimant was not required to refund payments received for unemployment after leaving large city and moving to small town, where he stated in claim that he was available for work and was looking for work even though subsequent claim was denied on the ground that he was not at a point where there was an available labor market, since claim on which he received payment was not received as the result of a misrepresentation of a material fact. Claim of Sapp, 75 Idaho 65, 266 P.2d 1027 (1954).
    Logging superintendent, who was without work for a portion of the year due to the fact that logging was seasonal, was available for work even though he also was president of a lumber corporation, where duties as president did not prevent him from doing logging work. Eytchison v. Employment Sec. Agency, 77 Idaho 448, 294 P.2d 593 (1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         The employment security act is social legislation, designed to alleviate economic insecurity and to relieve hardships resulting from involuntary unemployment. It was intended to provide benefits for those unemployed under prescribed conditions who are willing and able to work but unable to secure a suitable employment on the labor market. Johns v. S.H. Kress & Co., 78 Idaho 544, 307 P.2d 217 (1957).
        </p>
        <p>
         The board and the appeals examiner were required to decide whether the claimant met the requirements of availability for suitable work. In re Walker’s Claim, 80 Idaho 420, 332 P.2d 199 (1958).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section directs that many factors shall be considered in determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual, and in addition to the specified factors it provides “and other pertinent factors shall be considered,” thus making it clear that the legislative intent is that all factors, in order to do justice to the applicant in keeping with the spirit of the act, shall be considered. Johnson v. Employment Sec. Agency, 81 Idaho 560, 347 P.2d 764 (1959).
        </p>
        <p>
         Availability for work requires no more than availability for suitable work which the claimant has no good cause for refusing. Johnson v. Employment Sec. Agency, 81 Idaho 560, 347 P.2d 764 (1959).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant was able to work, available for suitable work, and seeking work, suitable work was not offered and refused when claimant was told by his supervisor that he could not perform job, the distance to work was thirty miles, and the claimant was sixty-eight years of age. Johnson v. Employment Sec. Agency, 81 Idaho 560, 347 P.2d 764 (1959).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subdivision i(3) [now (7)(c)] of this statute has application only to conditions imposed by the prospective employer, and is not applicable to conditions imposed by prospective employee or his labor union. Norman v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 1, 356 P.2d 913 (1960).
        </p>
        <p>
         A claimant may render himself unavailable for work by imposing conditions and limitations as to employment so as to bar his recovery of unemployment compensation, since willingness to be employed conditionally does not meet the test of availability. Ellis v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 95, 358 P.2d 396 (1961).
        </p>
        <p>
         An ex-service man who spent his time since his discharge from the navy traveling between his home in Idaho and San Francisco and Los Angeles, inquiring about and seeking to expedite the shipment of his car from Hawaii, awaiting the arrival of his car, returning a car borrowed from a relative, and vainly seeking interviews for data managing employment or in interviews for such employment with employers who considered him unqualified because of lack of background training was not available for employment within the meaning of this section. Kirkbride v. Department of Emp., 91 Idaho 658, 429 P.2d 390 (1967).
        </p>
        <p>
         Applicant, who was laid off from his warehouseman’s job, although always ready and willing to return to work, and who started remodeling a building he purchased in the future hope of opening a restaurant was found not to be self employed. Corwin v. Sunshine Mining Co., 96 Idaho 211, 525 P.2d 993 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a stand-by employee sought out and accepted full-time employment but requested and received permission to start such work one night later than planned, the employee did not refuse without good cause to accept available work or voluntarily quit work, nor could he be accused of misconduct barring him from receiving unemployment compensation. White v. Idaho Forest Indus., 98 Idaho 784, 572 P.2d 887 (1977).
    Where a claimant would not accept a reduction in pay in excess of six percent of her prior earnings, after a lengthy period of unemployment, the commission was entitled to conclude that such a self-imposed restriction operated in favor of ineligibility. Guillard v. Department of Emp., 100 Idaho 647, 603 P.2d 981 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         The general rule appears to be that student-claimants who are held eligible for unemployment benefits are those who place availability for work ahead of their schooling and demonstrate a willingness to change class schedules or drop out of school if job conflict makes such necessary. The demonstrated inquiry is whether the claimant is genuinely attached to the labor market or principally interested in obtaining an education. Davenport v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 103 Idaho 492, 650 P.2d 634 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the undisputed evidence showed that the claimant had worked as a waitress and a factory worker for 20 years, that she had been working from 22 to 52 hours a week at two jobs when she was terminated from one job, that she did not indicate to potential employers that she was attending college classes, that she had stated her willingness to quit school or drop conflicting classes if necessary to obtain a new job, and that she had continued to work in her second job, the claimant demonstrated her attachment to the work force and her part-time college attendance did not render her unavailable for work. Davenport v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 103 Idaho 492, 650 P.2d 634 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though claimant was unable to work, unavailable for suitable work, and not seeking work during period he was hospitalized, he was still eligible for benefits since the disability took place after he had begun to receive benefits and no suitable work was available during the period of disability. Artis v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 107 Idaho 1109, 695 P.2d 1248 (1985).

        </p>
        <p>
         Burden of proof is on claimant to show that he is available for work. Claim of Sapp, 75 Idaho 65, 266 P.2d 1027 (1954).
        </p>
        <p>
         Claimant, a carpenter, upon termination of his employment by reason of the completion of the project, filed claim for unemployment benefits and was thereafter paid benefits. Excluding a short employment interval and vacation period, the unemployed carpenter commenced constructing a dwelling on two lots he owned, during his spare time while unemployed and such was held to be an increment of his estate equal to, if not greater than, the wages he would have been required to pay other artisans to work for him and he was held fully employed and receiving actual wages, and therefore not entitled to compensation benefits, but since he had received them in good faith was not required to repay benefits received. Hatch v. Employment Sec. Agency, 79 Idaho 246, 313 P.2d 1067 (1957).
        </p>
        <p>
         The burden was upon the claimant to show he had complied with the requirements of the employment security act, that is, that he was (1) able to work, (2) available for suitable work, and (3) seeking work. In re Walker’s Claim, 80 Idaho 420, 332 P.2d 199 (1958); Ellis v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 95, 358 P.2d 396 (1961).

    Involuntary restrictions, such as age, do not place a greater burden upon a claimant in establishing his eligibility; the only requirements are that a claimant must be (1) able to work; (2) available for suitable work; and (3) seeking work.

         Where employer countered with testimony that the 10th of the month was the only pay day during the month but the 25th day constituted an “advance” day on which an employee could request, and at the discretion of the employer, receive an advance on his salary and where the record disclosed no such request on the 25th was made by the claimant, the claimant failed to carry his burden of showing his voluntary termination of employment upon good cause. Toland v. Schneider, 94 Idaho 556, 494 P.2d 154 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the wages earned by claimant, found by the board to be $295 for eight working days, produced an average of $37.00 per day, which was not shown by the record to be an unduly low wage as compared to the average sawyer’s wage in that area during that time of year, a claim of low wages did not meet the burden of proof to show that claimant’s voluntary termination of employment was based upon good cause. Toland v. Schneider, 94 Idaho 556, 494 P.2d 154 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
         Where a claimant voluntarily terminates employment, that claimant bears the burden of establishing “good cause” with respect to the statutory requirement that a claimant’s unemployment is not due to quitting without good cause.

        </p>
        <p>
         When a claimant’s eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits is challenged by the employer on the ground that the employment was terminated for misconduct, the employer must carry the burden of proving that the employee was in fact discharged for employment-related misconduct. Parker v. St. Maries Plywood, 101 Idaho 415, 614 P.2d 955 (1980); Roll v. City of Middleton, 105 Idaho 22, 665 P.2d 721 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the check which the claimant submitted as proof that he had performed services subsequent to June 17, 1984, the beginning of his first benefit year, stated that it was for services rendered from “1985-1990,” the check on its face indicated that at least some portion thereof was to be considered wages for future and as yet unrendered services, and where in addition the claimant’s own testimony was that the check represented either past or future wages, the record supported the industrial commission’s decision that the claimant failed in his burden of proof that he had rendered services of the requisite value. Madsen v. Idaho Dep’t of Transp., 112 Idaho 104, 730 P.2d 1024 (1986).
    The claimant bears the burden of showing that he has satisfied all of the eligibility requirements. Burnside v. Gate City Steel Corp., 112 Idaho 1040, 739 P.2d 339 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         The burden of proving discharge is on the claimant, and only if the claimant proves discharge does the employer have the burden of proving misconduct. Johnson v. Idaho Cent. Credit Union, 127 Idaho 867, 908 P.2d 560 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         The burden of proving employment-related misconduct lies with the employer. Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, 129 Idaho 833, 933 P.2d 642 (1997).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the case of a claim where the putative employer disputes that a worker was engaged in covered employment, covered employment cannot be assumed and the worker must show engagement in covered employment as part of the claim for benefits.

        </p>
        <p>
         Because the employee voluntarily quit his employment with his employer, he had the burden of proving that good cause existed for him to do so; the Idaho industrial commission decision, supported by substantial and competent evidence, was that the employee had failed to prove that he had good cause to quit his employment because he failed to provide the employer or the Idaho department of labor with sufficient medical evidence exhibiting the degree of risk to his health or physical condition while the record remained open.

         Former employee claimed that his Facebook post was a rhetorical statement, but the employer found it to be a threat, contrary to its social media policy. As employee failed to meet his burden to provide a record to support his claims, the court could not assume error. The commission found that the employee’s signed acknowledgement of the social media policy was evidence that the policy was communicated to him, and the finding that the employee engaged in employment-related misconduct and, thus, was not entitled to unemployment benefits was affirmed.

         It was permissible for this section to exclude daytime but not nighttime students from eligibility for unemployment benefits, since the legislature could rationally conclude that daytime work is far more plentiful than nighttime work and that consequently daytime students restrict the range of jobs open to them; and the fact that the classification is imperfect because some daytime students actually find job opportunities more numerous at night does not invalidate the statute under U.S. Const., Amend.

         “Misconduct” which will disqualify a claimant from receiving unemployment benefits means, “wilful, intentional disregard of the employer’s interest; a deliberate violation of the employer’s rules; or a disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his employees.” Weston v.

         Claimant, who after discharge from armed forces, was hired as a fire fighter and assigned duties as a member of “brush crew,” was properly denied unemployment benefits where none of his contentions, that having spent two years in armed services he did not desire to be placed in a “barracks” atmosphere, that he felt the hourly pay was insufficient and that he felt that he was going to be “laid off” for part of winter in near future, were sufficient to require granting the benefits.

It does imply a conscious wrong and may be distinguished from an act maliciously or corruptly done, in that it does not necessarily imply an evil mind.

         While it is a fact as set forth in the findings of a federal employing agency that claimant resigned, Idaho authorities must apply Idaho law to determine if claimant voluntarily left his employment without good cause. Saulls v. Employment Sec. Agency, 85 Idaho 212, 377 P.2d 789 (1963).

         In order to constitute good cause, the circumstances which compel the decision to leave employment must be real, not imaginary, substantial, not trifling, and reasonable, not whimsical; there must be some compulsion produced by extraneous and necessitous circumstances. The standard of what constitutes good cause is the standard of reasonableness as applied to the average man or woman and not to the supersensitive. Burroughs v. Employment Sec. Agency, 86 Idaho 412, 387 P.2d 473 (1963); Ullrich v. Thorpe Elec., 109 Idaho 820, 712 P.2d 521 (1985).

         A construction of “good cause” as used in this section, which will enable an employee to resign and yet be eligible for unemployment compensation, must not be extended to include purely personal and objective reasons which are unique to the employee, but requires that such cause is not a condition which by common knowledge is usual where accompanied by minor irritations.

         An employee who quit his job as a ski lift operator because the transportation provided by the employer between his lodging and his place of employment caused him to get motion sickness and because he was not given the extra shift work he expected and which would have made it possible for him to provide his own transportation left his employment voluntarily without good cause within the meaning of this section, where the employee knew before accepting employment the transportation offered by the employer would cause motion sickness and where there was no evidence that the hours and pay offered him were less favorable than those prevailing for like employment in that locality. Clark v. Bogus Basin Recreational Ass’n, 91 Idaho 916, 435 P.2d 256 (1967).
    Mere fact that claimant, who after discharge from armed forces, was hired as a fire fighter and assigned duties as a member of “brush crew,” may not have enjoyed the prospect of living away from town and in a logging camp was not enough to establish “good cause” where no evidence showed that living in such atmosphere would in any way be deleterious to his mental or physical health or well being.

         A substantial reduction in working hours, under some circumstances, may provide good cause for termination of one’s employment, but a part-time worker, who had previously refused to accept full-time employment, does not have cause to quit simply because her hours are somewhat reduced.

         Where claimant had a reasonable alternative to quitting: he could have discussed his back problem, which was aggravated by the working conditions, with his employer and he could have discussed his dissatisfaction with not being given the sales job for which he thought he had been hired, such claimant did not have “good cause” for leaving his employment and denial of unemployment benefits was supported by substantial evidence.

        <p>
         Where the claimant left his employment when he found that his wages had been reduced to $3.35 per hour from $7.50 to $13.00 per hour, the industrial commission’s finding of claimant’s good cause to voluntarily quit was reasonable and supported by the evidence. Kyle v. Beco Corp., 109 Idaho 267, 707 P.2d 378 (1985).
    The meaning of “good cause” within this section is a factual determination to be made by the commission on a case-by-case basis. Ullrich v. Thorpe Elec., 109 Idaho 820, 712 P.2d 521 (1985).

         The industrial commission did not err in concluding that an employee who resigned voluntarily, believing he had a firm job offer from another employer, left his employment voluntarily with “good cause,” as is required under the personal eligibility conditions of the employment security act.

         A determination of “good cause” to terminate employment under this section depends primarily upon the particular facts of a case. Schafer v. Ada County Assessor, 111 Idaho 870, 728 P.2d 394 (1986).
        </p>

         Whether “good cause” to terminate employment is present depends upon whether a reasonable person would consider the circumstances resulting in the claimant’s unemployment to be real, substantial, and compelling. Schafer v. Ada County Assessor, 111 Idaho 870, 728 P.2d 394 (1986).

        <p>
         Where there was no indication that employee was threatened or intimidated, or in any way forced to resign and since a request by an employer to complete assigned tasks simply does not amount to a “necessitous circumstance” that would compel a reasonable person to quit work, employee did not have good cause to resign. Hart v. Deary High Sch., 126 Idaho 550, 887 P.2d 1057 (1994).

        <p>
         Where employer testified that he told claimant he was to be placed on probation and discharged only at some point in the future if his performance did not improve, and claimant himself testified that employer stated “that if I didn’t speed up and do a lot of the stuff he thought I wasn’t doing, that he’d have to let me go” and fellow worker testified that claimant had decided to quit prior to requesting his advice and that he never encouraged claimant to resign, such testimony confirmed that any discharge was contingent upon future events, and was at odds with a claim that a person reasonably believed that he had already been discharged. Hart v. Deary High Sch., 126 Idaho 550, 887 P.2d 1057 (1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether an employee had “good cause” to quit is governed by the standard of reasonableness as applied to the average man or woman, and not to the supersensitive. There must be a compulsion to quit produced by real and necessitous circumstances. Further, an employee must explore all viable options before making the decision to quit. This further requirement stems from the fact that the policy of law is to encourage the employer and employee to adjust their differences and thus avoid interrupting the employment. Hart v. Deary High Sch., 126 Idaho 550, 887 P.2d 1057 (1994).
    Where the record was clear that, following his meeting with his employer, employee did not attempt to perform the requested tasks or to reach a compromise with employer and although employee testified to a perceived inability to do the work requested of him, an inability to handle one’s job does not rise to the level of good cause to resign. Hart v. Deary High Sch., 126 Idaho 550, 887 P.2d 1057 (1994).

         Industrial commission correctly found that an employee had good cause to quit her job, and was therefore entitled to unemployment benefits, where she had been discriminated against due to her decision to return to work following the birth of her child.

        </p>
        <p>
         Pursuant to this section, in order to qualify for unemployment benefits after voluntarily separating from work, a claimant must demonstrate that his resignation was for good cause connected with his employment; although the employee alleged conditions that created tension between himself and his former employer, those issues did not provide the employee with good cause to leave his employment. Buckham v. Idaho Elk’s Rehab. Hosp., 141 Idaho 338, 109 P.3d 726 (2005).

         Industrial commission did not err in denying the claimant unemployment benefits after she quit her job, because 1) she had failed to prove that she quit her employment for good cause, as the medical evidence presented did not establish that the claimant’s health or physical condition made it impossible for her to continue to perform the duties of her job, 2) the claimant’s treating physician stated that he did not advise the claimant to take time off from work, to change occupations, or to discontinue working, and 3) the treating physician stated that the claimant could work full time and that the only limitation of which he advised her was to wear a brace at work.

         Sexual harassment may constitute a “good cause” under this section, however, the term “sexual harassment” itself is not defined in the unemployment statute, nor does it appear therein, and rather than have the supreme court engage in what it perceives as creating judicial legislation with regard to “sexual harassment” in an area where the legislature has not spoken, it is more appropriate for the legislature or the department of employment [now department of labor] in its rules and regulations, to define “sexual harassment” and to establish guidelines for determining what constitutes same. Jensen v. Siemsen, 118 Idaho 1, 794 P.2d 271 (1990).
    Where an employee voluntarily quit her employment, the burden was on the employee to prove that it was for good cause; substantial and competent evidence supported the industrial commission’s finding that the sexual nature of the employee’s supervisor’s conduct created an unacceptable working condition, that the supervisor engaged in other behavior that created a hostile work environment, and that the employee pursued all available options before quitting her job, such that the decision of the commission that the employee quit for good cause in connection with her employment was proper.

         Insubordination of claimant or wilful disregard or violation of any rule or regulation of the employer involved was not established by competent evidence, claimant having given full testimony regarding his activities, of which testimony in the final analysis it was for the board to decide the credit and weight to be given such testimony. Ramsey v. Employment Sec. Agency, 85 Idaho 395, 379 P.2d 797 (1963).

        <p>
         An employee discharged from the postal service because of conviction of lewd conduct with minor or child under sixteen was “discharged for misconduct in connection with his employment” within the meaning of this section, as an employer has the right to expect his employees to refrain from acts which would bring dishonor on the business name or the institution. O’Neal v. Employment Sec. Agency, 89 Idaho 313, 404 P.2d 600 (1965).

         A heating and air conditioning service man required to be available to emergency call on a standby basis twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, unless replacement had been previously arranged for, discharged for habitually drinking while off-duty to the extent that he could not effectively answer service calls was not entitled to unemployment compensation. Oliver v. Creamer Heating & Appliance Co., 91 Idaho 312, 420 P.2d 795 (1966).
    Practice of telephone operators in making personal long-distance calls, without recording the same and without payment therefor, without the knowledge of and against the rules of the company, constituted “misconduct in connection with their employment” within the meaning of this section. Alder v. Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co., 92 Idaho 506, 446 P.2d 628 (1968).

         Claimant who assaulted president of company causing him to be hospitalized for ten days was ineligible for unemployment benefits as his unemployment was due to misconduct in connection with his employment. Levesque v. Hi-Boy Meats, Inc., 95 Idaho 808, 520 P.2d 549 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant was requested to perform certain work and refused the assignment as outside the purview of his job category and was discharged since there was not sufficient evidence to sustain finding of misconduct, he was entitled to unemployment compensation. Garrow v. Idaho State Sch. & Hosp., 95 Idaho 817, 520 P.2d 864 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant appeared before the industrial commission and testified that he had notified both the plant manager and his supervising leadman of the adverse effect of cold air on his broken tooth and such testimony was uncontradicted, such notice of physical handicap was proper and timely and claimant’s refusal to accept work outdoors on account of his physical handicap did not constitute misconduct in connection with his employment. Mata v. Broadmore Homes, 95 Idaho 873, 522 P.2d 586 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant complained about length of work week and routing schedules during telephone conversation with employer, but where claimant did not use vulgar or abusive language and did not refuse to obey an order or directive given to him by his employer, claimant’s conduct did not constitute “misconduct” which would disqualify him from unemployment compensation benefits. Avery v. B & B Rental Toilets, 97 Idaho 611, 549 P.2d 270 (1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant had been discharged for inadvertently omitting from his application for a position as a surveyor’s aide with a U.S. Forest Service office data concerning previous employment, claimant’s discharge from employment was not a discharge for “misconduct” so as to preclude him from recovering unemployment benefits, for there was no deliberate violation of the spirit of the employer’s rules. Wroble v. Bonners Ferry Ranger Station, 97 Idaho 900, 556 P.2d 859 (1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant violated company rules by using company typewriters to write private letters during business hours and repeatedly made private use of company telephones during working hours despite warnings, the industrial commission was not in error for denying claimant benefits on the ground that she had been discharged for misconduct. Hutchinson v. J.R. Simplot Co., 98 Idaho 346, 563 P.2d 404 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         While violation of an employer’s rules is not, per se, misconduct which will render an employee ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits, deliberate violation of reasonable company rules ordinarily is misconduct which renders the claimant ineligible. Hutchinson v. J.R. Simplot Co., 98 Idaho 346, 563 P.2d 404 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a stand-by employee sought out and accepted full-time employment but requested and received permission to start such work one night later than planned, the employee did not refuse without good cause to accept available work or voluntarily quit work, nor could he be accused of misconduct barring him from receiving unemployment compensation. White v. Idaho Forest Indus., 98 Idaho 784, 572 P.2d 887 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         An employer’s offer of other employment or transfer of employment to another department of the hospital would not constitute condonation of past misconduct and entitle claimant to unemployment benefits, since it is not unreasonable for employer to provide by rule that a higher or different standard of performance may be required in one department of the hospital as compared with other less critical areas of the hospital. Weston v. Gritman Mem. Hosp., 99 Idaho 717, 587 P.2d 1252 (1978).
    Violation of an employer’s rule is not, per se, misconduct within the meaning of this section; rather, a deliberate and intentional violation of the spirit of the rule is required. Simmons v. Department of Emp., 99 Idaho 290, 581 P.2d 336 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         The improper notification of an employee’s intended absence from work constituted such “misconduct” within the meaning of this section so as to make him ineligible for unemployment compensation. Jenkins v. Agri-Lines Corp., 100 Idaho 549, 602 P.2d 47 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant worked as a “knocker” on the “kill” floor of defendant-employer’s meat processing plant, had been drinking and discarding the glass bottles into a chute where parts of the animals killed were ground up for animal feed, had thrown a horn at a carcass, had been kicked in the face by a steer; argued with his supervisor, using extreme obscenities in an effort to cause a fight over whether he should go to a hospital; and was fired by his supervisor for insubordination, the industrial commission was correct in finding that he had been discharged “for misconduct in connection with his employment” within this section. Ortiz v. Armour & Co., 100 Idaho 363, 597 P.2d 606 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         An employer should at least be able to expect an employee to refrain from screaming profanities into the ear of his supervisor and trying to provoke him to fight when claimant deliberately refused to continue working when instructed to do so by his supervisor, and balked when told he should go to the hospital if he was hurt, these were reasonable directives given by his supervisor, and the company was entitled to have them obeyed. Ortiz v. Armour & Co., 100 Idaho 363, 597 P.2d 606 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the evidence in the record supported the finding that claimant was a very emotional and gregarious individual and that his threats against supervisors, who he believed to be harassing his daughter on the job, were merely spontaneous verbal expressions of emotion not intended to be taken literally; accordingly, commission’s decision that claimant was not disqualified from receiving benefits as having been discharged for misconduct was affirmed. Parker v. St. Maries Plywood, 101 Idaho 415, 614 P.2d 955 (1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         When an employer challenges an unemployment compensation benefit claimant’s eligibility for benefits on the ground that the claimant was discharged for employee misconduct, the employer must carry the burden of proving that the employee was in fact discharged for employment related misconduct. Parker v. St. Maries Plywood, 101 Idaho 415, 614 P.2d 955 (1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no requirement in the definition of misconduct that the claimant’s disregard of standards of behavior must be found to have been subjectively willful, intentional or deliberate; rather, the test for misconduct in standard-of-behavior cases is (1) whether the employee’s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the employer and (2) whether the employer’s expectation was objectively reasonable in the particular case; the employee’s subjective state of mind is irrelevant. Matthews v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 101 Idaho 657, 619 P.2d 1110 (1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where evidence showed that claimant was repeatedly late in reporting for work and was terminated on occasion when he reported late for work while under the influence of alcohol, there was sufficient evidence to support decision that claimant was guilty of misconduct in connection with his employment and was not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits. Dingley v. Boise Cascade Corp., 104 Idaho 476, 660 P.2d 941 (1983).
    Where the evidence showed that the claimant deputy sheriff entered a private residence uninvited late one night to allegedly alert the homeowner that her garage and house doors were unlocked, there was substantial, competent evidence of a disregard of standards of behavior which the sheriff employer had the right to expect of his employees, and the commission properly found that the deputy was discharged for misconduct. Cornwell v. Kootenai County Sheriff, 106 Idaho 823, 683 P.2d 859 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the evidence, though disputed, could be reasonably construed to show that claimant, a recreational therapist, displayed a negative, belligerent, and childish attitude; did not satisfactorily demonstrate or use the skills which were required for her job; did not endeavor to improve; did not meet the criteria defined by her employer for the position which she held; was consistently late to staff meetings without excuse and despite repeated warnings; and that she refused to follow her employer’s philosophy of patient care, the evidence was sufficient to show that the claimant was ineligible for benefits because she had been terminated for work-related misconduct. Harrelson v. Pine Crest Psychiatric Ctr., 107 Idaho 119, 686 P.2d 64 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         In this section, “discharged for misconduct” means wilful, intentional disregard of the employer’s interest, a deliberate violation of the employer’s rules, or a disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his employees; the test for misconduct in standard-of-behavior cases is (1) whether the employee’s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the employer; and (2) whether the employer’s expectation was objectively reasonable in the particular case. Goolsby v. Life Savers, Inc., 107 Idaho 456, 690 P.2d 911 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         False information given with “deceitful intent” on an employment application is grounds for discharge for misconduct, but an inadvertent omission on an employment application without “deceitful intent” is not an adequate basis to discharge an employee for misconduct. Brown v. Iowa Beef Processors, 107 Idaho 558, 691 P.2d 1173 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where an employee was discharged for failing to answer affirmatively a question on his job application relating to criminal convictions, the industrial commission properly denied unemployment benefits, since the evidence showed that the employee intentionally deceived the employer out of fear that he would not be hired if he answered truthfully; such false information, given with a deceitful intent, came within the meaning of a discharge for misconduct in this section. Brown v. Iowa Beef Processors, 107 Idaho 558, 691 P.2d 1173 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Some expectations and duties “flow normally from an employment relationship”; if certain practices or expectations are not common among employees in general or within a particular enterprise, and have not been communicated by the employer to the employee, they cannot serve as a proper basis for a charge of employee misconduct. Davis v. Howard O. Miller Co., 107 Idaho 1092, 695 P.2d 1231 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         The test for employee misconduct in standard-of-behavior cases is as follows: (1) whether the employee’s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the employer; and (2) whether the employer’s expectation was objectively reasonable in the particular case. An employee’s disregard of standards of behavior need not be subjectively willful, intentional or deliberate. Davis v. Howard O. Miller Co., 107 Idaho 1092, 695 P.2d 1231 (1984); Puckett v. Idaho Dep’t of Cors., 107 Idaho 1022, 695 P.2d 407 (1985); Swanson v. State, 114 Idaho 607, 759 P.2d 898 (1988); Ginther v. Boise Cascade Corp., 150 Idaho 143, 244 P.3d 1229 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         A violation of an employer’s rule is not per se misconduct that will disqualify a claimant from receiving unemployment benefits; rather, there must be a deliberate and intentional violation of the spirit of the rule by the claimant. Beaty v. City of Idaho Falls, 110 Idaho 891, 719 P.2d 1151 (1986).
    When an employee is discharged for misconduct, it must be shown to be work-related before unemployment benefits can be denied; work-relatedness is a factual determination and when a claimant’s eligibility for unemployment benefits is challenged by the employer on the ground that the employment was terminated for misconduct, the employer must carry the burden of proving that the employee was in fact discharged for employment-related misconduct. Beaty v. City of Idaho Falls, 110 Idaho 891, 719 P.2d 1151 (1986); Chapman v. NYK Line North America, Inc., 147 Idaho 178, 207 P.3d 154 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the employee was convicted of possession of stolen guns and marijuana, and he was discharged from his employment as a city garbage collector for violating the city’s employee code of conduct, there was no evidence of a deliberate violation of the specific rule at issue or the spirit of the city’s rules of conduct generally such that the employee’s off-duty conduct would amount to “misconduct” constituting a bar to unemployment benefits under this section. Beaty v. City of Idaho Falls, 110 Idaho 891, 719 P.2d 1151 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the question of whether an employee’s conduct constitutes misconduct pursuant to this section is a factual one, the industrial commission’s finding that an employee was fired for misconduct must be upheld if supported by substantial and competent evidence. Gatherer v. Doyles Whsle., 111 Idaho 470, 725 P.2d 175 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         The industrial commission’s finding that the employee was fired for misconduct was supported by substantial and competent evidence where the employee was fired for repeatedly expressing his disagreements with company policies loudly and in the presence of other employees, contrary to the express direction of the employer. Gatherer v. Doyles Whsle., 111 Idaho 470, 725 P.2d 175 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Employee was not discharged for misconduct where her supervisor testified that she was doing a very good job. Swanson v. State, 114 Idaho 607, 759 P.2d 898 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where there was substantial and competent evidence to support the commission’s findings that the employer became dissatisfied with the employee’s work performance after patients were lost due to her making contact at the patients’ places of employment and treating patients in a rude and abusive manner, and the employer received complaints about her from patients and co-employees, the commission properly denied the employee unemployment compensation benefits, because she was discharged for misconduct. Lang v. Ustick Dental Office, 120 Idaho 545, 817 P.2d 1069 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was substantial competent evidence to support the industrial commission’s finding that claimant was discharged for misconduct, which meant that claimant would not receive unemployment benefits; although the claimant may have had concerns about meeting with her supervisor alone, she had an obligation to discuss the matter with her supervisor or the administrator prior to the time of the scheduled meeting to make other arrangements, and the supervisor’s concerns about protecting patients’ confidentiality were real; therefore, the employer’s expectation that the claimant meet with the supervisor and/or administrator to discuss the problems was reasonable and the claimant’s refusal to do so constituted misconduct in connection with the employment. Taylor v. Burley Care Ctr., 121 Idaho 792, 828 P.2d 821 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Employee was not ineligible for unemployment benefits due to a discharge based on “misconduct” as used in this section where employee directed workers on a road reconstruction project to take a section of old concrete pipe to his personal residence. Campbell v. Bonneville County Bd. of Comm’rs, 126 Idaho 222, 880 P.2d 252 (1994).
    Misconduct, as used in this section is defined as either a willful, intentional disregard of the employer’s interest, a deliberate violation of the employer’s rules, or a disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his employees, with the third type of conduct determined by (1) whether the employees’ conduct fell below the standards of behavior expected by the employer; and (2) whether the employer’s expectation was objectively reasonable in the particular case. Wulff v. Sun Valley Co., 127 Idaho 71, 896 P.2d 979 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because misconduct under this section means (1) a willful and intentional disregard of the employer’s interest, (2) a deliberate violation of the employer’s rules, or (3) a disregard of standards of behavior that the employer has a right to expect of an employee, the industrial commission should have considered all three grounds for determining misconduct, and not just the first, when it determined claimant was not terminated for misconduct. Dietz v. Minidoka County Hwy. Dist., 127 Idaho 246, 899 P.2d 956 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         In measuring the sufficiency of the commission’s findings that claimant did not engage in misconduct disqualifying her from benefits, it is necessary to determine if employer proved (1) a deliberate violation of a known rule or (2) a breach of a standard of behavior that would flow normally from an employment relationship or which was communicated to claimant because of the uncommon nature. Wulff v. Sun Valley Co., 127 Idaho 71, 896 P.2d 979 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a proceeding for unemployment insurance benefits, where it is shown that the employer failed to communicate its expectations to employee, the employer could not be expected to comply with the uncommunicated expectations; consequently, employee could not be discharged for misconduct and is entitled to benefits. Welch v. Cowles Publishing Co., 127 Idaho 361, 900 P.2d 1372 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         An employer challenging a claimant’s eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits, carries the burden of proving that the employee was discharged for employment related misconduct. Welch v. Cowles Publishing Co., 127 Idaho 361, 900 P.2d 1372 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         The question of whether an employee’s conduct constituted misconduct pursuant to this section is a factual one, and the determination of the industrial commission will be upheld if supported by substantial and competent evidence.

        </p>
        <p>
         Where an employer passively turns a blind eye to otherwise objectionable conduct on the part of an employee, the employer does not lose the ability to discipline or terminate the employee which amounts to employment-related misconduct. Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, 129 Idaho 833, 933 P.2d 642 (1997).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although an employer’s expectation that an employee will not engage in “protracted argument” with his employer is objectively reasonable, a single incident of comparatively nonserious disrespect by complaining and arguing is not misconduct. Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, 129 Idaho 833, 933 P.2d 642 (1997).
        </p>
        <p>
         Teacher’s outburst and use of profanity in front of other teachers and students did not constitute a disregard of the standards of misbehavior which school district had a right to expect where teacher and principal had worked together as teachers prior to the one’s promotion to principal and during that period they had engaged in on ongoing course of conduct which included the use of profanity and when this happened principal did not formally reprimand teacher but simply requested that she not direct that type of language toward him; thus through his acquiescence, he let her to believe that such conduct was acceptable and that it was not inappropriate or unprofessional, and his failure to reprimand her when she used such language indicated to her that such behavior was appropriate between them; therefore, upon termination she was eligible for unemployment benefits. Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, 129 Idaho 833, 933 P.2d 642 (1997).
    Teacher was entitled to unemployment benefits following her termination because of her statements to principal in front of teachers and students using profanities, where it was established that principal and teacher had worked together as teachers for a long period before one became principal, that they frequently had used profane language in each other’s presence, that after the one’s promotion to principal, their relationship remained informal but turbulent and the teacher often visited principal in his office to express her dissatisfaction with the administration using profanities, that teacher was in an emotional state of mind due to a myriad of personal problems she was experiencing and had received news that the school had canceled the school program that was her main work, since such statements constituted a comparatively nonserious instance of disrespect, and the substantial and competent evidence supported the finding that her conduct did not constitute a willful or deliberate disregard of standards of behavior but was an emotional knee-jerk reaction of a stressful situation and because she lacked the required intent so that her behavior did not rise to the level of insubordination. Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, 129 Idaho 833, 933 P.2d 642 (1997).

         Where during fourteen-year-period that claimant worked for employer as an industrial hygienist, there were no warnings that his method of recording test results was wrong; claimant’s testimony that personal tests could be conducted without that person being present was not clearly contradicted; and employer did not establish that claimant’s alleged failure to comply with regulations constituted a violation of employer’s reasonable expectations, it followed that the commission correctly held that claimant’s discharge was not justified for misconduct as claimed by employer Quinn v. J.R. Simplot Co., 131 Idaho 318, 955 P.2d 1097 (1998).
        </p>

         The question of whether an employee’s behavior constitutes misconduct in connection with employment pursuant to this section is a question of fact and court will uphold industrial commission’s determination of the issue, if supported by substantial and competent evidence.

        <p>
         There was substantial and competent evidence that the employee was discharged for misconduct and therefore not eligible for unemployment benefits, where the restaurant had a written policy on proper cash handling, and the policy was reasonable to ensure the employer collects for the services provided to the customer; the employee was aware of the company’s rules, which had been communicated to her both when she was hired and in her second write-up, which expressly warned her that the next violation would result in termination; and as established by company policy, the employee was terminated after her third violation. Steen v. Denny’s Restaurant, 135 Idaho 234, 16 P.3d 910 (2000).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the evidence showed that an employee received two warning letters regarding misconduct, but then was terminated a few days later while on vacation, the employer failed to show that the employee was ineligible for unemployment benefits based on a failure to adhere to the employer’s reasonable standard of behavior. Oxley v. Med. Rock Specialties, Inc., 139 Idaho 476, 80 P.3d 1077 (2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the evidence showed that an employer waited four months to investigate allegations that an employee had stolen inventory and was unable to provide evidence of which items were taken or when the events occurred, there was insufficient evidence to support a misconduct claim based on theft; therefore, unemployment benefits were properly awarded. Oxley v. Med. Rock Specialties, Inc., 139 Idaho 476, 80 P.3d 1077 (2003).
    Employee’s failure to maintain his insurability on the employer’s automobile policy did not rise to “misconduct”, where the employer had not adequately informed the employee as to what he had to do to remain insurable. Harris v. Elec. Wholesale, 141 Idaho 1, 105 P.3d 267 (2004).

         Employment-related misconduct includes any of the following: (1) a willful, intentional disregard of the employer’s interest; (2) a deliberate violation of the employer’s reasonable rules; or (3) a disregard of a standard of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his employees.

         Whether an employee’s behavior constitutes “misconduct” is a factual determination that will be upheld on appeal unless not supported by substantial and competent evidence. Mussman v. Kootenai County, 150 Idaho 68, 244 P.3d 212 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Misconduct under a standard of behavior test requires the employer to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) the employee’s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the employer; and (2) the employer’s expectations were objectively reasonable under the circumstances. The first prong of the test speaks only to what the employer subjectively expected from the employee, while the second prong considers whether the employer’s expectations are reasonable. In order for an employer’s expectation to be objectively reasonable, the expectation must be communicated to the employee, unless the expectation is the type that flows naturally from the employment relationship. Mussman v. Kootenai County, 150 Idaho 68, 244 P.3d 212 (2010).

         Industrial commission erred in awarding unemployment benefits to an employee who was terminated; the employee’s refusal to disclose to the employer the source of a rumor regarding the closing of one of the employer’s facilities constituted misconduct. Stark v. Assisted Living Concepts, Inc., 152 Idaho 506, 272 P.3d 478 (2012).
    There is no requirement that employee misconduct cause an employer harm, whether direct or indirect, in order for it to constitute misconduct under this section. Stark v. Assisted Living Concepts, Inc., 152 Idaho 506, 272 P.3d 478 (2012).

         Idaho industrial commission’s finding of misconduct this section was supported by substantial and competent evidence. It showed that the professor’s behavior clearly fell below the standard expected by the university, as it was undisputed that after several warnings, the professor continued to air his concerns and make accusations in mass e-mails and meetings. The university’s standards were objectively reasonable because the university communicated its expectations to the professor but he failed to raise his concerns through the proper channels and his conduct was not a single instance of complaint but rather was a pattern of potentially slanderous public accusations. Sadid v. Idaho State Univ., 154 Idaho 88, 294 P.3d 1100 (2013).

        <p>
         Industrial commission properly held that an employee was not entitled to unemployment benefits, because she was terminated for employment-related misconduct, based upon her failure to perform her job duties to the employer’s expectations, when she was capable of doing so, and for insubordination where the employee refused to get some coffee beans when directed to do so by her supervisor, which directive was objectively reasonable and necessary for the employee to complete her job duties.

        <p>
         The burden falls on the employer to prove an employee’s discharge was for misconduct in connection with employment. Under the standard of behavior test, the employer must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) the employee’s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the employer, and (2) the employer’s expectations were objectively reasonable under the circumstances. The first inquiry addresses the employer’s subjective expectations, while the second considers whether those expectations are objectively reasonable. An expectation is objectively reasonable if it is communicated to the employee, or if it flows naturally from the employment relationship. Whether the employer’s expectations were objectively reasonable is a question of fact Sparks v. Laura Drake Ins. & Fin. Servs., 164 Idaho 138, 426 P.3d 489 (2018).

         A claimant’s application for unemployment benefits was properly turned down by the department of employment [now department of labor], where the employer grounded claimant’s discharge on his failure, in applying for work at its plant, to enter a checkmark to indicate that he had had “epilepsy or fits,” even though claimant’s fellow employees at the plant were aware of his affliction, and that he made no attempt to conceal it, and even though when he applied for work he had been seizure-free for over six years.

         When an employee voluntarily terminates employment and seeks unemployment benefits, it is incumbent upon him to show that the termination was based on “good cause” as required by the statute. McMunn v. Department of Public Lands, 94 Idaho 493, 491 P.2d 1265 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         An employee has not left work “voluntarily without good cause” if conditions were unsuitable compared to the job as originally offered. Clay v. Crooks Indus., 96 Idaho 378, 529 P.2d 774 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where union sheet metal workers employed by one subcontractor walked off a job site in protest of another subcontractor using nonunion sheet metal workers, and upon attempting to return to work were told that the job was over, they did not intend to voluntarily terminate their employment and could not be denied unemployment benefits under this section. Coates v. Bingham Mechanical & Metal Prod., Inc., 96 Idaho 606, 533 P.2d 595 (1975).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where claimant left his employment following employer’s denial of claimant’s request for leave of absence so he could bring his family to Idaho, claimant failed to sustain his burden of showing good cause for voluntary termination of employment and, thus, failed to show he was entitled to unemployment benefits. Flynn v. Amfac Foods, Inc., 97 Idaho 768, 554 P.2d 946 (1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a claimant for unemployment compensation terminated her previous employment in order to accompany her husband to a different locale, the claimant was not eligible for unemployment compensation, since her employment was terminated by her own free will for causes over which her employer had no control and which had nothing to do with the conditions of her employment. Pyeatt v. Idaho State Univ., 98 Idaho 424, 565 P.2d 1381 (1977).
    Where a stand-by employee sought out and accepted full-time employment but requested and received permission to start such work one night later than planned, the employee did not refuse without good cause to accept available work or voluntarily quit work, nor could he be accused of misconduct barring him from receiving unemployment compensation. White v. Idaho Forest Indus., 98 Idaho 784, 572 P.2d 887 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where there was substantial and competent evidence in the record to support the commission’s findings that the claimant quit his employment due to his son’s termination, and that such was not a sufficiently compelling reason to constitute “good cause” for leaving his employment to make him eligible for unemployment benefits pursuant to this section, the order of the industrial commission would be affirmed. Harris v. Green Tree, Inc., 100 Idaho 227, 596 P.2d 99 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a school superintendent informed all teachers that they would be expected to have not more than a seven percent failure rate, and they would be required to justify any failure rate exceeding that percentage, but where claimant declined to renew her teaching contract at the school for the coming year because she felt she could not conform to the newly announced guidelines without violating her own ethical and professional standards, unemployment benefits were properly denied on the grounds that she voluntarily and without good cause quit her employment. Fong v. Jerome School Dist. No. 261, 101 Idaho 219, 611 P.2d 1004 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         A condition of eligibility for unemployment compensation is that a claimant has not left employment voluntarily without good cause; a claimant who has voluntarily left employment bears the burden of establishing that such termination was for good cause. Tendoy Area Council v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 108 Idaho 441, 700 P.2d 63 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Factual determination of commission that claimant’s resignation was voluntary was not clearly erroneous where employer testified that he told claimant that he was to be placed on probation and discharged only at some point in the future if his performance did not improve, that claimant testified that employer told him if he didn’t speed up and do more he thought he’d have to let him go, and that fellow employee testified that claimant had decided to quit prior to asking for his advice and that he did not encourage claimant to resign, for such testimony confirmed holding that any discharge was contingent on future events. Hart v. Deary High Sch., 126 Idaho 550, 887 P.2d 1057 (1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Industrial commission did not misapply the statute when it denied the employee’s claim for unemployment benefits where the commission determined that the employee had voluntarily terminated her employment with the employer without good cause connected to her employment. Ewins v. Allied Sec., 138 Idaho 343, 63 P.3d 469 (2003).

        <p>
         The county sheriff’s threat of filing criminal charges against former deputy sheriff was not good cause as a matter of law for voluntarily resigning, where the deputy sheriff was subsequently convicted of embezzling funds from her employer. Hine v. Twin Falls County, 114 Idaho 244, 755 P.2d 1282 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the employee attempted to withdraw resignation only two hours after it was submitted, she had been an employee for eight years, and her employer took the extraordinary precipitate action of following the employee to her home to deliver his acceptance, the employee did not leave her employment voluntarily without good cause; a denial of unemployment benefits in such a context would contravene the liberal construction necessary to effectuate the purpose of the employment security act. Swanson v. State, 114 Idaho 607, 759 P.2d 898 (1988).
    The industrial commission erred as a matter of law in failing to consider the employee’s intention when she submitted her resignation which she withdrew only two hours later. Swanson v. State, 114 Idaho 607, 759 P.2d 898 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Absent prejudice to the employer as might take place where a resignation sets in motion steps for hiring a replacement, a denial of unemployment compensation is improper. Swanson v. State, 114 Idaho 607, 759 P.2d 898 (1988).

         Fact that employee refused to accept work of different nature and at less pay would not necessarily render him unavailable for work in the absence of finding by board as to whether he could find the same or similar employment within reasonable distance of his home.

The minimum qualifying amount of wages shall be determined each January 1 and shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the product of the state minimum wage, as defined by section 44-1502, Idaho Code, multiplied by five hundred twenty (520) hours, rounded to the lowest multiple of twenty-six (26).

The maximum weekly benefit amount shall be fifty-five percent (55%) of the state average weekly wage paid by covered employers for the preceding calendar year.

        Any eligible individual shall be entitled during any benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to his weekly benefit amount times the number of full weeks of benefit entitlement appearing in the following table based on his ratio of total base period earnings to highest quarter base period earnings. The maximum weeks of entitlement are based on a sliding scale of the official forecasted, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the state for a minimum of ten (10) weeks to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks depending on the unemployment rate in effect for the months of February, May, August and November as follows:

Subject to appeal proceedings and judicial review by the Supreme Court as set forth in this section, any determination, redetermination or decision as to rights to benefits shall be conclusive for all purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to collateral attack irrespective of notice.

    Where a claimant for unemployment benefits does not file a complaint pursuant to Idaho R. Civ. P. 3, but files claims for benefits according to this section, the claim for unemployment benefits does not constitute a civil action for which attorney fees can be awarded pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121</a></cite>. Johnson v. Idaho Cent. Credit Union, 127 Idaho 867, 908 P.2d 560 (1995). Appeals.
        </p>
        <p>
         The condition of claimant’s health and ability to work is a question of fact for the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] whose finding based on substantial and competent evidence will not be disturbed on review. Turner v. Boise Lodge No. 310, 77 Idaho 465, 295 P.2d 256 (1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the industrial accident board’s [now industrial commission] findings were supported by substantial and competent evidence, they will not be disturbed on appeal. Bean v. Employment Sec. Agency, 81 Idaho 551, 347 P.2d 339 (1959); Boodry v. Eddy Bakeries Co., 88 Idaho 165, 397 P.2d 256 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal from the industrial accident board’s [now industrial commission] determination on questions of unemployment benefits, the jurisdiction of the supreme court is limited to a review of questions of law. Cahoon v. Employment Sec. Agency, 82 Idaho 224, 351 P.2d 477 (1960); Boodry v. Eddy Bakeries Co., 88 Idaho 165, 397 P.2d 256 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         Except where the right of appeal is secured by the Constitution, so as to have become a constitutional right, it is dependent entirely upon the statute and is subject to the control of the legislature which may, in its discretion, grant or take away the remedy and prescribe in what cases, under what circumstance, in what manner and to and from what courts appeals may be taken. Striebeck v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 531, 366 P.2d 589 (1961).
        </p>
        <p>
         It is clear the legislature intended that for the purpose of perfecting an appeal as provided in this section, service of a notice of determination or redetermination shall be regarded and adjudged as complete when delivered to the person being served or on the date of mailing if mailed to such person at his last known address. It is equally clear that the legislature did not intend to leave the right of appeal open beyond the 14 day period provided by this section. Striebeck v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 531, 366 P.2d 589 (1961).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where appellant failed to appeal from the redetermination decision (copy of which was mailed to her under date of Nov. 18, 1960) within the 14 day period provided by this section, she lost her right to have such decision reviewed regardless of her statements that she did not understand that she had to file a request for appeal within 14 days of determination of noneligibility for benefits. Striebeck v. Employment Sec. Agency, 83 Idaho 531, 366 P.2d 589 (1961).
        </p>
        <p>
         In unemployment compensation appeals the supreme court is restricted to deciding questions of law and will not disturb the factual findings of the board though based on conflicting evidence. Toland v. Schneider, 94 Idaho 556, 494 P.2d 154 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where only claimant appeared and testified before the industrial commission reiterating his statements made to the appeals examiner and employer did not appear before the commission, findings of the commission not supported by substantial, competent evidence are not binding on appeal. Mata v. Broadmore Homes, 95 Idaho 873, 522 P.2d 586 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal, the court is not bound by the industrial commission’s view of the testimony where the commission has not observed the witnesses but is only reviewing the record. Clay v. Crooks Indus., 96 Idaho 378, 529 P.2d 774 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a decision rendered in November 1973 was set aside and a new order issued on rehearing in January 1974, an appeal filed immediately after the order on rehearing was not timely as the 30-day time limit for filing an appeal pursuant to (former)<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-725" target="_self">§ 72-725 </a></cite>began running from the November order. Department of Emp. v. St. Alphonsus Hosp., 96 Idaho 470, 531 P.2d 232 (1975).
    Since the statutory requirements governing the right to appeal under this section are mandatory and jurisdictional, a claimant who failed to appeal a determination of ineligibility within 14 days after notice was mailed lost her right to have the determination of ineligibility reviewed, even though claimant did not receive notice of the determination until after the prescribed 14-day period. Fouste v. Department of Emp., 97 Idaho 162, 540 P.2d 1341 (1975).
        </p>
        <p>
         In reviewing industrial commission ruling that claimant had failed to sustain his burden of showing good cause for his voluntary termination of employment, the supreme court would not consider evidence indicating that claimant’s wife was ill, where such evidence was not before the hearing examiner or the industrial commission. Flynn v. Amfac Foods, Inc., 97 Idaho 768, 554 P.2d 946 (1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the department of employment’s [now department of labor] regulations, the date of the postmark on a claim for review pursuant to this section is deemed to be the date of its filing with the industrial commission. Department of Emp. v. Drinkard, 98 Idaho 222, 560 P.2d 1312 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the decision of the appeals examiner was mailed before its effective date, such service could not activate the running of the 14-day appeal period any sooner than the date the decision was rendered, as appeared on the face of the decision itself. Department of Emp. v. Drinkard, 98 Idaho 222, 560 P.2d 1312 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a claimant for unemployment benefits left town without leaving a change of address, so that the efforts of the department of employment [now department of labor] to notify him of a redetermination were unsuccessful, the claimant’s failure to appeal the redetermination within 14 days foreclosed his right to review. Hacking v. Department of Emp., 98 Idaho 839, 573 P.2d 158 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section is not a carte blanche allowing an employer the unbridled right to present a substantially new case absent some showing as to why the evidence was unavailable earlier. White v. Idaho Forest Indus., 98 Idaho 784, 572 P.2d 887 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Findings of fact by the industrial commission will not be disturbed when supported by substantial and competent evidence. Hutchinson v. J.R. Simplot Co., 98 Idaho 346, 563 P.2d 404 (1977); Simmons v. Department of Emp., 99 Idaho 290, 581 P.2d 336 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section together with the inappropriateness of judicial review of questions of fact, militates against assuming an expanded scope of appellate review in unemployment compensation cases involving factual disputes, regardless of whether witnesses have personally appeared before the industrial commission; the court therefore declines to independently adopt findings of fact at variance with those of the industrial commission where such findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record. Booth v. City of Burley, 99 Idaho 229, 580 P.2d 75 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the claimant was never notified at any stage in the appellate proceedings that any issue concerning any eligibility requirement existed, other than the issue of self employment, it was error for the commission to remand the unemployment compensation matter to the department of employment [now department of labor] for additional findings as to whether the claimant was available for work and seeking work during her period of unemployment. Colvard v. Department of Emp., 98 Idaho 868, 574 P.2d 910 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether or not witnesses appear before the industrial commission, appellate review by the supreme court is restricted to reviewing questions of law. Simmons v. Department of Emp., 99 Idaho 290, 581 P.2d 336 (1978).
    Hearings before the appeals examiner and before the industrial commission are in the nature of trials de novo since additional evidence can be presented at such hearings. Ortiz v. Armour & Co., 100 Idaho 363, 597 P.2d 606 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section deals with service of notice of determinations and redeterminations by department of employment [now department of labor], not appeals by interested parties. Hill v. State, Dep’t of Emp., 116 Idaho 727, 779 P.2d 402 (1989).
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 72-719(3) does not give the industrial commission the authority to rescind a prior order that has become final and conclusive for all purposes once the time for appeal has expired under the employment security law. Although<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t72c07s72-719" target="_self">§ 72-719</a></cite>(3), part of Idaho’s comprehensive worker’s compensation law, provides for correction due to manifest injustice, there is no corresponding statute under Idaho’s employment security law. Welch v. Del Monte Corp., 128 Idaho 513, 915 P.2d 1371 (1996).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because no motion for reconsideration or appeal was filed during the 50-day interim between the issuance of the industrial commission’s order denying claimant’s motion for reconsideration of department’s conclusion that he was discharged for misconduct and its order purporting to set aside the prior order, its findings of facts as to both orders are conclusive for all purposes of the employment security law. Welch v. Del Monte Corp., 128 Idaho 513, 915 P.2d 1371 (1996).
        </p>
        <p>
         Industrial commission correctly held a claimant’s appeals hearing request was untimely because (1) the claimant received the department of labor’s decision in time to timely appeal, and (2) the claimant did not show the postal error exception extending the time to appeal in cases of postal service error applied, since the claimant received notice in time to appeal. Kennedy v. Hagadone Hospitality Co., 159 Idaho 157, 357 P.3d 1265 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Letter from a former employee of defendant/employer was not allowed to be submitted on appeal as additional evidence to support claim by a discharged employee for unemployment benefits, because only the industrial commission has the authority to take additional evidence. Copper v. Ace Hardware/Sannan, Inc., 159 Idaho 638, 365 P.3d 394 (2016).

         Subsection (f) (now (6)) of this section refers to subsection (e) (now (5)) of this section only in terms of an appeals examiner serving notice of his decision.

        <p>
         In enacting this section, the legislature provided that the industrial commission’s review would be based upon the record of the proceedings before the appeals examiner. The industrial commission’s responsibility and scope of review in employment compensation claims is clearly set forth in this section. Steffen v. Davison, Copple, Copple & Copple, 120 Idaho 129, 814 P.2d 29 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section did not bar industrial commission’s de novo review of appeals examiner’s decision, because: the examiner’s decision was not final, the employment security law contemplates a unified statutory scheme, and, as the ultimate factfinder for determining eligibility status, the commission is entitled to consider all the evidence and issues presented to the appeals examiner. Scrivner v. Service IDA Corp., 126 Idaho 954, 895 P.2d 555 (1995).
    Because this section applies only to “additional evidence” and there was no indication that the industrial commission considered a letter, which claimant included with his appeal to the commission of his denial of unemployment benefits, as additional evidence in reaching its decision, the commission was not required to strike the letter requesting review. Dietz v. Minidoka County Hwy. Dist., 127 Idaho 246, 899 P.2d 956 (1995).

        <p>
         It was permissible for this section to exclude daytime but not nighttime students from eligibility for unemployment benefits, since the legislature could rationally conclude that daytime work is far more plentiful than nighttime work and that consequently daytime students restrict the range of jobs open to them; and the fact that the classification is imperfect because some daytime students actually find job opportunities more numerous at night does not invalidate the statute under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Idaho Dep’t of Emp. v. Smith, 434 U.S. 100, 98 S. Ct. 327, 54 L. Ed. 2d 324 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         The due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV did not invalidate the provision of this section that service by mail of a redetermination notice be deemed complete on a date of mailing, even where the recipient’s absence from town on the day of delivery prevented him from making a timely response, since an otherwise fair notice procedure cannot be invalidated because of the recipient’s unavailability to receive his own mail.

         The industrial commission found that claimant’s leaving of business checkbook with signed blank checks unattended as in direct contravention of the directions of the employer and allowing the service station gas tanks to become empty on several occasions was behavior constituting employment-related misconduct warranting his discharge thus precluding him from receiving unemployment compensation benefits.

         Where there was substantial and competent evidence to support the commission’s findings that the employer became dissatisfied with the employee’s work performance after patients were lost due to her making contact at the patients’ places of employment and treating patients in a rude and abusive manner, and the employer received complaints about her from patients and co-employees, the commission properly denied the employee unemployment compensation benefits because she was discharged for misconduct.

         Evidence that telephone operators made personal long-distance calls, without recording the same, at night when no supervisor was present and the exchange was in charge of the senior operator present and that this practice was expressly prohibited by a book of rules and regulations supplied each operator was sufficient to support the board’s finding that the company did not have such knowledge of this practice that it must be taken to have permitted, tolerated, or condoned the practice.

         Where record demonstrated that school district’s counsel was aware of prior agreement and recommendation of discharge some four months before hearing to discharge teacher and the transcript of the hearing which resulted in teacher’s discharge indicated that school district’s counsel specifically referred to such document in his opening statement, the industrial commission reasonably ruled that the district could have discovered such prior recommendation of discharge before the hearing with the exercise of reasonable diligence, and thus commission’s refusal to augment the record with the recommendation was not an abuse of discretion.

         This section does not require the industrial commission to consider additional evidence. Instead, it allows the commission to receive new evidence that was unavailable at the time of the hearing before the appeals examiner; it is not carte blanche allowing a party the unbridled right to present a substantially new case, absent some showing of why the evidence had not been available earlier.

         Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the employee’s request for a hearing to supplement the record where the employee knew, when he filed the notice of appeal from the decision of the claims examiner, the employee needed additional information from the physician in order to support his claim; the employee failed to explain to the Idaho industrial commission why he did not provide the evidence while the record was still open because the employee had adequate time and access to the physician to obtain the necessary information regarding a change in employment prior to the Appeals Examiner’s hearing.

         It was error to affirm an appeals examiner’s finding of no jurisdiction to consider a claimant’s protest of a denial of benefits. The claimant’s protest was not an untimely appeal of a prior determination that the claimant could not receive benefits because he owed the state for earlier overpayments, but rather it was a timely appeal of a current decision denying the claimant’s new request for benefits, due to the prior overpayment remaining unrepaid, as to which the claimant was entitled to a fair hearing.

Excluding a short employment interval and vacation period, the unemployed carpenter commenced constructing a dwelling on two lots he owned doing this in his spare time while unemployed and such was held to be an increment of his estate equal to, if not greater, than the wages he would have been required to pay other artisans to work for him and he was held fully employed and receiving actual wages, and therefore not entitled to compensation benefits, but since he had received them in good faith was not required to repay benefits received.

         Where the claimant himself produces evidence that might form an additional basis for the denial of benefits, the additional issue should be called to the attention of the hearing examiner and thus permit him an opportunity to rehear, affirm, modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in such case or on the basis of additional evidence; and the claimant must also be given notice and a fair opportunity to meet the issue.

         Assuming that an employee possessed new evidence of discrimination that was unavailable at the time of her hearing before the appeals examiner — and that the industrial commission thus erred by not addressing the employee’s argument that she had good cause to quit her job due to such discrimination — the commission’s decision to deny unemployment benefits nonetheless had to be affirmed because the employee did not meet the burden of demonstrating that she had explored viable options prior to leaving her employment. Higgins v. Larry Miller Subaru-Mitsubishi, 145 Idaho 1, 175 P.3d 163 (2007).
    Once an employee, who seeks to introduce new evidence in an appeal to the industrial commission, provides an explanation of why the proposed evidence was not presented before the appeals examiner, the commission must exercise its discretion and review the matter to determine whether the interests of justice require the presentation of the additional evidence.

         Excessive Penalties.
        </h5>
        <p>
         Where no penalties had been assessed under the unemployment compensation statute, the question of whether excessive penalties were authorized thereunder so as to render the statute unconstitutional was not properly before the court on appeal.

         Where the trial court has not seen or heard the witnesses and the findings are based upon depositions, the appellate court is in as favorable position to weigh the evidence as the trial judge, whose findings then are not conclusive on the supreme court. Phipps v. Boise St. Car Co., 61 Idaho 740, 107 P.2d 148 (1940).
    The supreme court is equally bound by findings of fact made by industrial accident board [now industrial commission] in both cases involving unemployment and industrial accident. Idaho Mut. Benefit Ass’n v. Robison, 65 Idaho 793, 154 P.2d 156 (1944).

        <p>
         It is clear that the legislature intended that a claimant should be entitled to compensation benefits if his discharge or unemployment was not due to his own conduct. Webster v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 68 Idaho 1, 187 P.2d 527 (1947).

        <p>
         The courts were not divested of jurisdiction where the administration of the unemployment compensation law was placed with the industrial accident board [now industrial commission], and there was no violation of due process in denying persons right to be heard by impartial trial, since the board is not an adversary. Idaho Mut. Benefit Ass’n v. Robison, 65 Idaho 793, 154 P.2d 156 (1944).

        <p>
         Under unemployment compensation law, the district court had jurisdiction to construe the law and pass upon its constitutionality, but it had no jurisdiction to investigate the facts, to make findings thereon or to determine the weight of the evidence or credibility of the witnesses.

        <p>
         Under unemployment compensation law, an employee who voluntarily quit her last employment had no “vested right” to benefits under her initial eligibility, by reason of having filed her claim prior to an enactment of an amendment disqualifying an employee who voluntarily quit last place of employment from benefits, and hence, denial of benefits to an employee did not give the amendment a prohibited retroactive effect.

         Claimant, a carpenter, upon termination of his employment by reason of the completion of the project, filed claim for unemployment benefits and was thereafter paid benefits. Excluding a short employment interval and vacation period, the unemployed carpenter commenced constructing a dwelling on two lots he owned, doing this in his spare time while unemployed and such was held to be an increment of his estate equal to, if not greater than, the wages he would have been required to pay other artisans to work for him and he was held fully employed and receiving actual wages, and therefore not entitled to compensation benefits, but since he had received them in good faith was not required to repay benefits received.

         The Idaho industrial commission’s order, finding part-time firefighters were “paid firefighters” entitled to a cost of living adjustment from the Firemen’s Retirement Fund, was void because, under this section, the commission only had jurisdiction to decide specific claims and did not have jurisdiction to decide a petition for declaratory relief, which had to be pursued in a district court.

         The doctrine of res judicata has no application to appellant’s claim for death benefits under the firemen’s retirement fund and in regard to respondent’s plea of the statute of limitations, contained in the workmen’s compensation aw, the industrial accident board [now industrial commission] has ruled by virtue of the provisions of this section relating to claims, process, hearing and appeals, are by reference a part of the firemen’s retirement act.

Any paid firefighter employed in the state by a city or fire district, on or after July 1, 1976, shall be employed under the provisions as set forth in Option II; provided however, that any paid firefighter employed on or after July 1, 1976, who has consistently been treated as an Option I firefighter for contribution purposes may, prior to retirement, make an election to select either Option I or Option II; provided further, that any such paid firefighter who selects Option II shall, prior to retirement, pay any additional required employee contributions and the firefighter’s employer shall pay any additional required employer contributions, as determined by the board.

       § 72-1444. Refund to firefighter terminating employment — Repayment on reemployment — Conversion of contributions — Purchase of service credits.
      </h3>

       <li id="t72c14s72-1444ol11">
        If the employment of a paid firefighter, irrespective of date of hire, as defined in this chapter, is terminated for any reason prior to the completion of twenty (20) years of service, and he cannot qualify for benefits under any other provision of this chapter, he shall be entitled to receive at the time of said termination one hundred percent (100%) of his accumulated contributions. If such firefighter is subsequently reemployed as a paid firefighter with duties which involve or are incidental to firefighting, he may reinstate his previous credited service by repaying to the retirement fund the full amount of his accumulated contributions provided such repayment includes payment of interest as determined by the board.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c14s72-1444ol12">
        In lieu of withdrawing his accumulated contributions as provided in subsection (1) of this section, a paid firefighter may elect to convert his accumulated contributions to an equivalent benefit entitlement under the provisions of chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code, as if such contributions had been made by the firefighter at the contribution rate of a paid firefighter under the provisions of chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code; this conversion will normally result in a higher “years of service” factor than the firefighter actually served under the provisions of chapter 14, title 72, Idaho Code. It is legislative intent that this is precisely the effect to be achieved.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c14s72-1444ol13">
        No paid firefighter may elect to proceed under the provisions of subsection (2) until he has been personally interviewed and advised by the director of the public employee retirement system, or his designee, on the choices available. The firefighter may be accompanied during such interview by any person of his choice.
       </li>
       <li id="t72c14s72-1444ol14">
        Paid firefighters who did not participate as a member of the system between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 1981, because of termination from employment due to reductions in work force may purchase service credits for all or part of that period. The cost of such service credit shall be the full actuarial cost as determined by the board and shall be paid in full prior to the effective date of retirement. The employer may elect, but is not required, to participate in purchasing service credit under this section. In no event shall the retirement system be liable for payment of any such costs. Terminations from employment due to a reduction in work force are limited to terminations that resulted from the elimination of a position due to budgetary constraints.

        Any paid firefighter incapacitated by injury in the performance of duty, or by illness attributable wholly or partially to service as a paid firefighter, shall be retired so long as such disability shall continue in a degree which prevents efficient service, limited to a maximum of two (2) years, and during such disability shall be paid from the public employee retirement account [fund] the monthly retirement sum to which he would be entitled if he elected to retire, but in no event less than a monthly sum equal to: (a) sixty-five per cent (65%) of the average paid firefighter’s salary or wage in this state if the incapacitated firefighter is an Option I firefighter; or, (b) sixty-five per cent (65%) of the said firefighter’s average monthly salary or wage, based on his average final compensation, if the incapacitated firefighter is an Option II firefighter. The monthly sum shall vary annually according to the cost of living adjustment as set forth in section 72-1471, Idaho Code.

The benefits shall be maintained only until a paid firefighter is eligible for disability retirement under the provisions of chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code. The costs for such benefits shall be paid from the appropriation made in section 59-1394(1)(b), Idaho Code.

       Upon application of a firefighter or his or her department head for a service disability retirement, and prior to said retirement, a medical examination of said firefighter shall be given by a medical committee consisting of a physician named by the public employee retirement system board, a physician named by the firefighter claiming benefits, and a third physician designated by the first two (2) physicians so named. If the medical committee, by a majority opinion certifies in writing, that: (1) the firefighter is physically incapacitated for the efficient performance of the duties as a paid firefighter, as defined under the provisions of subsection (G), section 72-1403, Idaho Code, in the service of the city or fire district, (2) such incapacity is likely to be permanent, (3) the member should be retired, and (4) there is medical evidence of probative value including reports of clinical findings (such as the individual’s medical history, physical status examinations), laboratory findings, diagnosis and treatment prescribed and response to such treatment, the public employee retirement system board may approve such application for retirement as provided herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the disabled firefighter is still retired at the conclusion of the two (2) year period, the public employee retirement system board shall determine whether the disability renders the disabled firefighter totally incapacitated. “Totally incapacitated” as used in this section means the inability to perform work in any remunerative employment. It is not necessary for a person to be absolutely helpless or entirely unable to do anything worthy of compensation to be considered totally incapacitated. If the person is so incapacitated that substantially all the avenues of gainful employment are reasonably closed to him, his condition is within the meaning of “totally incapacitated.” In evaluating whether a person is totally incapacitated, the medical factor of permanent impairment and nonmedical factors such as age, sex, education, economic and social environment, and training and usable skills shall be considered. If the disabled firefighter is totally incapacitated, then payments shall continue at the rate prescribed in this section during the period of total incapacity. A medical committee may be summoned to determine total incapacity as provided above.
    (2) If the disabled firefighter is less than totally incapacitated at the end of the two (2) year period, but has a disability which reduces his presumed ability to engage in gainful activity, payments shall be made to the disabled firefighter during the period of his disability as hereinafter provided. The board shall determine the percentage of disability suffered by the disabled firefighter as compared to the whole man. A medical committee, comprised as prescribed in this section, may be summoned to determine the percentage of disability suffered by the disabled firefighter. The disabled firefighter shall receive a disability benefit equal to the percentage that his disability bears to a totally incapacitated person.

       (3) The public employee retirement system board shall provide and maintain disability benefits for all paid firefighters. Their benefits shall be as follows:

         To the extent that the purpose of the 1973 amendments was to increase the retirement benefits for firemen who retired either voluntarily or non-voluntarily, the amendment to this section by S.L. 1973, ch. 105, § 3 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that its effect was to substantially diminish the retirement benefits of a fireman who retired in 1974 after 23 years’ service because of a nonservice-connected dis-ability.

         Since this section burdens only those firefighters who are members of the firemen’s retirement fund (FRF) and are subject to involuntary retirement because of injuries resulting in the award of worker’s compensation benefits, it classifies both on the basis of involuntary retirement versus voluntary retirement, and membership in the FRF versus the public employees retirement board system, and the classification is arbitrary as between the firefighter injured early in his career, who ultimately receives 100% of both his worker’s compensation and retirement, and the firefighter injured shortly before retirement who suffers the reduction, the offset provisions of this section are inoperative as violative of equal protection of the law. Deonier v. State, Pub. Employee Retirement Bd., 114 Idaho 721, 760 P.2d 1137 (1988) (decision prior to 1976 amendment).

         The new administrative interpretation of this section as requiring that disability retirement benefits be offset by the amount of lump sum worker’s compensation benefits previously received materially altered contractual expectations regarding the vested rights of firefighters subject to the firemen’s retirement fund, creating an unconstitutional impairment of contract.

         On its face, this section operates to decrease the amount of disability retirement benefits received by employees by the amount of worker’s compensation benefits they are entitled to receive, but reasonable interpretation of this section does not allow for any offsetting of worker’s compensation benefits from moneys earned as deferred wages.

      <p>
       Irrespective of the date of retirement, at least once each year during the first five (5) years following the retirement of a firefighter with a disability retirement pension and in any three (3) year period thereafter, the public employee retirement system board may, or upon the disabled firefighter’s application shall, require the disabled firefighter to undergo a medical examination, to be made by or under the direction of a physician designated by the board, at the place of residence of said disabled firefighter or other place mutually agreed upon. Should any disabled firefighter refuse to submit to such medical examination in any period, his or her disability retirement may be discontinued by the board and should such refusal continue for one (1) year all his or her rights in and to his or her disability retirement pension shall be revoked by the board. If upon such medical examination of said disabled firefighter, the said physician reports to the board that said disabled firefighter is physically able and capable of resuming employment in the classification held by him or her at the time of his or her retirement, he or she shall be restored to active service in the employment of the city or fire district and payment of his or her disability retirement shall cease, provided the report of the physician is concurred in by the board. A disabled firefighter so restored to active service shall from the date of his or her return to service become a member of the retirement system, thereafter in the same manner as prior to his or her disability retirement. Any service credited to him or her at the time of his or her disability retirement shall be restored to full force and effect. He or she shall be given credit for the period he or she was receiving service disability pension, provided under section 72-1445, Idaho Code; he or she shall not be given service credit for the period he or she was receiving a nonservice disability pension, provided under section 72-1446, Idaho Code. When a disabled firefighter on a disability retirement engages in work activities commensurate with the physical demands that were required in his or her classification as a firefighter, the work performed may demonstrate that said firefighter has the ability to be restored as a firefighter in the employ of the city or fire district. However, the circumstances under which the work was performed generally must be considered. Where said disabled firefighter has to discontinue his or her work after a short time because of his or her impairment, his or her work activities would not demonstrate ability to resume his or her employment as a firefighter. The findings of the adequacy of the said firefighter’s performance of work activities must be concurred in by the board. If said firefighter has a disability which is amenable to corrective treatment that could be expected to restore his or her efficient performance of duties of a paid firefighter, as defined in section 72-1403(G), Idaho Code, he or she would be considered disabled, provided he or she is undergoing the treatment prescribed by the medical committee, as set forth in section 72-1445, Idaho Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, nothing in this section shall be construed to require a firefighter who in good faith relies on or is treated by prayer through spiritual means alone by a duly accredited practitioner of a well-recognized church to undergo any medical or surgical treatment, nor shall he or his dependents be deprived of any benefits hereunder to which he would have been entitled if medical or surgical treatment were employed.

      This chapter establishes an automated state directory of new hires to be administered by the department of labor for the purpose of securing for this state the maximum benefits of the act of congress, approved August 22, 1996, known as the “Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.” The state directory of new hires provides a means for employers to assist in the state’s efforts to prevent fraud in the welfare, worker’s compensation, and unemployment insurance programs, to locate individuals to establish paternity, to locate absent parents who owe child support, and to collect support from those parents by reporting information concerning newly hired and rehired employees directly to a centralized state database.

       The purpose of this act is to promote alcohol and drug-free workplaces and otherwise support employers in their efforts to eliminate substance abuse in the workplace, and thereby enhance workplace safety and increase productivity. This act establishes voluntary drug and alcohol testing guidelines for employers that, when complied with, will find an employee who tests positive for drugs or alcohol at fault, and will constitute misconduct under the employment security law as provided in section 72-1366, Idaho Code, thus resulting in the denial of unemployment benefits.

       It is the further purpose of this act to promote alcohol and drug-free workplaces in order that employers in this state be afforded the opportunity to maximize their levels of productivity, enhance their competitive positions in the marketplace and reach their desired levels of success without experiencing the cost delays and tragedies associated with work-related accidents resulting from substance abuse by employees.
