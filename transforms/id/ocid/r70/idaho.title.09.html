        It sometimes occurs that the doctrine of judicial notice works a reversal of a case where the judgment of the lower court was correct at the time it was rendered and such may be the case where a foreign government had no right to sue because it had not been recognized by the state department of the United States, but after an adverse decision and pending appeal by it, such government was recognized, then the judgment of the lower court will be reversed upon the reviewing court taking judicial notice of such recognition by the state department.

Mundell v. Swedlund, 58 Idaho 209, 71 P.2d 434 (1937); Allan v. Oregon Short Line R.R., 60 Idaho 267, 90 P.2d 707 (1938); Girard v. Defenbach, 61 Idaho 702, 106 P.2d 1010 (1940); Bishop v.

        A statute susceptible of two constructions, one of which would render it invalid should be so construed that the statute may be sustained. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 6 v. Common Sch. Dist. No. 38, 64 Idaho 303, 131 P.2d 786 (1942).

        Ordinarily, issues of negligence present questions of fact to be resolved by a jury; however, where the facts are undisputed and where but one reasonable conclusion can be drawn therefrom, the issue of the existence of negligence becomes a question of law to be resolved by the court. Baker v. Barlow, 94 Idaho 712, 496 P.2d 949 (1972).

      All persons, without exception, otherwise than is specified in the next two (2) sections, who, having organs of sense, can perceive, and, perceiving, can make known their perceptions to others, may be witnesses. Therefore, neither parties nor other persons who have an interest in the event of an action or proceeding are excluded; nor those who have been convicted of crime; nor persons on account of their opinions on matters of religious belief; although in every case the credibility of the witness may be drawn in question, by the manner in which he testifies, by the character of his testimony, or by evidence affecting his character for truth, honesty or integrity, or his motives, or by contradictory evidence; and the jury are the exclusive judges of his credibility.

       <p>
        Although the jury in a rape case believes that the prosecutrix made contradictory statements with respect to the acts complained of, it did not necessarily follow that it must reject all of her testimony as untrue. State v. Harp, 31 Idaho 597, 173 P. 1148 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jury may believe or disbelieve the testimony of any witness, or any portion of such testimony, even though such witness may have in some respects testified falsely in respect to a material matter, or been contradicted. State v. Cacavas, 55 Idaho 538, 44 P.2d 1110 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a credible witness, with apparently adequate opportunity for observation, testifies to an occurrence, the mere testimony of other witnesses that they were not cognizant of the occurrence, where the opportunities of the latter witnesses for observation are not stated, or where it affirmatively appears that their situation was such that they probably would not have observed the event if it had occurred, or where their opportunities were not coextensive with those of a witness who testifies positively to the occurrence, is not sufficient to create a conflict in the testimony. Graham v. Leek, 65 Idaho 279, 144 P.2d 475 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contention that the evidence failed to establish either the time for the performance of the contract or the amount of work to be performed thereunder was one for determination by the jury in view of testimony that fails to disclose a meeting of the minds, one party claiming there was no agreement as to the hauling of additional ore while the other maintained the contract provided for the hauling of 50,000 tons of ore. Curzon v. Wells Cargo, Inc., 86 Idaho 38, 382 P.2d 906 (1963).

        The issues presented by conflicting witnesses and the credibility of the witnesses were for resolution by the jury. State v. Peterson, 87 Idaho 147, 391 P.2d 846 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that the testimony of witnesses in a statutory rape case was sharply conflicting only raised questions as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and these were matters which were exclusively for the jury’s determination.

        This section adds nothing to the established rule of impeaching the credibility of witnesses; it does not authorize incompetent impeaching questions such as whether witness is truthful and whether he has repeatedly told falsehoods. People v. Barnes, 2 Idaho 161, 9 P. 532 (1886).
    Purpose of this section is to remove all common-law disqualifications except those set out in the two sections next following. Sprouse v. Magee, 46 Idaho 622, 269 P. 993 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sections 9-201 to 9-203 have been the law of Idaho since 1881 when they were enacted by the territorial legislature. They intended to, and did, remove all common-law disqualifications save as enumerated in the following sections. Pierstorff v. Gray’s Auto Shop, 58 Idaho 438, 74 P.2d 171 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule applicable to all witnesses, whether parties or interested in the event of an action, is that either a board, court, or jury must accept as true the positive, uncontradicted testimony of a credible witness, unless his testimony is inherently improbable, or rendered so by facts and circumstances disclosed at the hearing or trial.

        The provisions of this statute are not made applicable exclusively to civil actions but apply to criminal prosecutions. State v. Orr, 53 Idaho 452, 24 P.2d 679 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution of defendant for committing lewd and lascivious acts on daughter, the latter, though only 12 years of age at the time of trial, was competent to testify where, on voir dire, it was disclosed that she was capable of receiving just impressions and relating them truly to the jury. State v. Madrid, 74 Idaho 200, 259 P.2d 1044 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an accused in a criminal action voluntarily takes the witness stand, he subjects himself to cross-examination and impeachment under the same rules and conditions as any other witness. State v. Storms, 84 Idaho 372, 372 P.2d 748 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature intended that a witness might be impeached in a criminal action as in a civil action; the defendant in a criminal action, as a party to the action, need not testify at all and if he deems it prudent to remain silent, no presumption is to be indulged against him; however, when he voluntarily assumes the character of a witness, he exposes himself to the legitimate attacks which may be made upon any witness. State v. Storms, 84 Idaho 372, 372 P.2d 748 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error to deny a defendant’s motion to dismiss, at the close of the state’s evidence, made on the ground that the prosecution’s chief witness’s testimony was “fantastic and incredible and could not be believed”; it being within the province of the jury to believe or disbelieve the testimony of any witness. State v. Larsen, 91 Idaho 42, 415 P.2d 685 (1966).

       <p>
        A burglary defendant who had testified that, due to intoxication and the taking of pathibamate pills for ulcers, he had no recollection of anything between a time several hours prior to being found in the store that was entered and a time several hours later was not competent to answer a question by his counsel as to his intent in entering the store.

        The habitual use of opium, morphine, cocaine, or other like narcotics, which inevitably tend to impair the mind, destroy the memory, and pervert the moral character of a witness, may be shown for the purpose of affecting his credibility or the weight that should be given to his testimony; this, however, is not ground for the exclusion of his testimony unless it satisfactorily appears that he was under its influence to such an extent that his intellect was impaired when examined as a witness.

        Where a witness has offered to testify to the statements of another person, spoken in a language not understood by him but translated for him by an interpreter, he is not qualified to testify as to the statement since he does not speak from personal knowledge; the interpreter or some other person who heard and understood the language in which the testimony was given, is the only competent witness to such statement.

        The 1927, 1947 and 1965 acts amended subdivision 3. Prior to the 1927 amendment subdivision 3 read, “Parties or assignors of parties to an action or proceeding, or persons in whose behalf an action or proceeding is prosecuted against an executor or administrator, upon a claim or demand against the estate of a deceased person as to any matter of fact occurring before the death of such deceased person.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1927 act struck out the words “as to any matter of fact” and inserted in lieu thereof the words “as to any communication, or agreement, not in writing.” The 1947 act restored the section to its original form.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1965 amendment struck out the words “matter of fact” and substituted “communication or agreement not in writing.”

       <p>
        Section 2 of S.L. 1965, ch. 113, read: “The amendment incorporated herein shall be applicable only to those claims or demands against the estate of a deceased person arising subsequent to the effective date of this act.”

        In prosecution of defendant for the committing of lewd and lascivious acts on daughter, the latter, though only 12 years of age at the time of trial, was competent to testify where, on voir dire, it was disclosed that she was capable of receiving just impressions and relating them truly to the jury. State v. Madrid, 74 Idaho 200, 259 P.2d 1044 (1953).

        Boys thirteen and sixteen years of age were competent witnesses in an arson trial. State v. Dunn, 91 Idaho 870, 434 P.2d 88 (1967).

       <p>
        There was no error in admitting the testimony of children aged five and six years who were confused and inconsistent in answering test questions on quantitative analyses, but who gave clear and consistent answers to questions concerning the offense with which the defendant was charged. State v. Ross, 92 Idaho 709, 449 P.2d 369 (1968), overruled on other grounds, Sharp v. Idaho Inv. Corp., 95 Idaho 113, 504 P.2d 383 (1972), and overruled on other grounds, State v. McNeely, 162 Idaho 413, 398 P.3d 146 (2017).
    Although the testimony of a nine year old child revealed a fair measure of embarrassment and lack of poise, and although with respect to the sequence of events her testimony was at times vague, she was unwavering in her testimony that the defendant took the alleged liberties with her and her friend, and, thus, the decision of the trial judge that the nine year old’s indecisiveness went to weight as opposed to admissibility was not in error. State v. McKenney, 101 Idaho 149, 609 P.2d 1140 (1980).

        Out-of-court statements by child who was an alleged victim of sexual abuse were not per se unreliable, or presumptively unreliable, on the ground that the trial court found the child incompetent to testify at trial. Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990).

       <p>
        This section, which provides that children under ten cannot be witnesses if they appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts or of relating them truly, is invalid to the extent that it attempts to prescribe admissibility of hearsay and is in conflict with Idaho Evid.

        See Compiler’s Notes regarding amendments of subdivision 3.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is drastic in its provision that claimants against estate can not be witnesses as to any matter of fact occurring before death of deceased. Goldensmith v. Worstell, 35 Idaho 679, 208 P. 836 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        A presumption is indulged that a verdict obtained for the claimant for services to the deceased was not based on evidence of communications with the deceased, where there was other competent evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict. Hartley v. Bohrer, 52 Idaho 72, 11 P.2d 616 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, a claimant who sought to recover for services rendered in caring for the testator during his lifetime is a competent witness to testify as to the services performed and the value thereof. Hubbard v. Ball, 59 Idaho 78, 81 P.2d 73 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where contractors, required to furnish two surety bonds on their contract with the government, appointed deceased to represent them in procuring the required bonds but made it a condition of that appointment that the plaintiff share equally in the commissions on all bonds, and deceased wrote a memorandum agreement acknowledging plaintiff’s right to share equally in commissions on all bonds, the memorandum was admissible in plaintiff’s action against the deceased’s executrix to recover a balance due on broker’s commission, notwithstanding that it was signed only by the contractors and the deceased, since it was a written contract imposing duties and conferring benefits on and for the benefit of three parties. Clay v. Rossi, 62 Idaho 140, 108 P.2d 506 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        This statute was evidently changed by the 1927 amendment for a purpose and that purpose must have been to relax instead of restrict the rule. By the amendment, there is no prohibition against a claimant testifying to occurrences in relation to or in connection with a contract or agreement in writing; such as delivery of the agreement, possession thereof, and payment or nonpayment, or rendition of services, or furnishing goods or material thereunder, and similar facts or circumstances. The prohibition, however extends to and comprehends contracts and agreements not in writing. Dowd v. Dowd, 62 Idaho 157, 108 P.2d 287 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the husband’s contract to repay loans made by the wife was evidenced by writing, other facts involved in the transaction, including a release of a mortgage and return of the mortgage and note to the husband, and redelivery of the agreement to the wife, were collateral to the writing and did not in effect establish a new and independent contract; hence testimony concerning such facts was not inadmissible under the 1927 amendment, in the wife’s action against the husband’s estate as involving “communication or agreement not in writing.” Dowd v. Dowd, 62 Idaho 157, 108 P.2d 287 (1940).
    Plaintiffs, who brought action against executor of deceased executor to impress a trust, were not competent witnesses to testify as to what deceased executor told them concerning their interest in the estate. Burns v. Skogstad, 69 Idaho 227, 206 P.2d 765 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiffs filed an action against estate of a deceased to set aside a deed, and court allowed plaintiffs to testify as to what occurred prior to death of deceased, over objection of the defendant, and trial court by its finding of fact decided that such evidence was incompetent, but further found that there was sufficient evidence exclusive of questioned evidence to sustain its finding in favor of the plaintiff, such admission of incompetent evidence was held not reversible error, since there was sufficient evidence to establish facts involved. Dahlberg v. Johnson’s Estate, 70 Idaho 51, 211 P.2d 764 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action by stepchildren of decedent for specific performance of an alleged oral contract of the decedent to will to them all of her property is a claim or demand against the estate of the deceased person, and it was reversible error for the court to allow the plaintiffs to testify as to what occurred prior to death of decedent over objections by the defendants. Johnson v. Flatness, 70 Idaho 37, 211 P.2d 769 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrator can waive objection to testimony by plaintiff in suit on claim, either by failure to object or by cross-examination. Chapman v. Booth, 71 Idaho 359, 232 P.2d 668 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Incompetency of witness to testify under this section as to any matter of fact occurring before death of deceased was not waived by executrix’s action in taking and filing discovery deposition even though deposition was not introduced in evidence. Thomas v. Thomas, 83 Idaho 86, 357 P.2d 935 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        A right of action to enforce an agreement to devise certain real estate arose when the promisor died intestate and, where the promise was made prior to the effective date of the 1965 amendment to this section but the promisor died after, this section as amended in 1965 applied rather than the section as it existed when the promise was made. Quayle v. Mackert, 92 Idaho 563, 447 P.2d 679 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not preclude all proof that could be submitted in husband’s claim against wife’s estate, as it does not prohibit others from testifying as to the facts. Estate of Carlson, 93 Idaho 258, 460 P.2d 393 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where widow testified as to husband’s donative intent in a suit brought by children of deceased claiming a share, the court held her testimony was not in error as the widow was not a party, assignor, or person on whose behalf this suit was brought, nor was it a claim or demand against the estate. Greene v. Cooke, 96 Idaho 48, 524 P.2d 176 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alleged hearsay declarations of deceased were properly admitted when testified to by at least one witness who was not a party in proceeding seeking to compel defendants to convey real property. Smith v. Smith, 95 Idaho 825, 521 P.2d 143 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision 3. only applies to claims against the estate of the deceased person. Webster v. Magleby, 98 Idaho 326, 563 P.2d 50 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        From an examination of subdivision 3. of this section, it appears that the statute bars (1) certain persons from testifying (2) in specified actions (3) as to certain communications and all three conditions must be satisfied in order for the evidence to be barred. Argyle v. Slemaker, 99 Idaho 544, 585 P.2d 954 (1978).
    Statements concerning the state of a deed’s description upon delivery do not involve a “communication or agreement, not in writing” within the meaning of subdivision 3. of this section. Argyle v. Slemaker, 99 Idaho 544, 585 P.2d 954 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although testimony concerning oral agreements is barred in appropriate cases, subdivision 3. of this section does not bar testimony concerning a state of affairs or matters of fact occurring before the decedent’s death. Argyle v. Slemaker, 99 Idaho 544, 585 P.2d 954 (1978).

       <p>
        Under this section in an action against an administrator to establish a resulting trust against the decedent, the plaintiff in such action is disqualified from being a witness as to matters of fact occurring before the death of such deceased person. Rice v. Rigley, 7 Idaho 115, 61 P. 290 (1900).

       <p>
        Action by A and B against the estate of C to enforce specific performance of an alleged oral prospector’s contract and seeking to hold the estate of C as trustee of interest in mining claim is a claim or demand against said estate, and plaintiffs are disqualified from being witnesses as to matters of fact occurring before death of C. Rice v. Rigley, 7 Idaho 115, 61 P. 290 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase “claim or demand”, as used in this section, embraces all rights of action for the establishment of a trust in land as well as claims or demands for debts or damages against the estate of a deceased person. Rice v. Rigley, 7 Idaho 115, 61 P. 290 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action in claim and delivery to which administrator is a party, and in which certain of the parties claim right to possession as assignees of a claim against the estate represented by administrator, which is secured by mortgage upon property in question, and in which action no relief is sought against estate, is not an action “upon a claim or demand against the estate of a deceased person” such as to preclude a party thereto from testifying. Cunningham v. Stoner, 10 Idaho 549, 79 P. 228 (1904).
       </p>

        This section does not apply where claim is not against estate, but is to establish claim against third party. Bertleson v. Van Deusen Co., 37 Idaho 199, 217 P. 983 (1923).

       <p>
        Where plaintiff, suing for malpractice against the estate of his deceased physician attempted to testify that he was not informed of the dangers inherent in the surgery he had undergone, his testimony was properly excluded under subdivision 3. of this section since he would be giving only his interpretation of the conversation, which the deceased could not rebut.

Smith v. Smith, 95 Idaho 477, 511 P.2d 294 (1973).
    District court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence concerning a beneficiary’s intent when signing a promissory note on behalf of a relative because the action did not concern a demand against an estate or a claim against an executor or administrator under subdivision 3; moreover, the evidence did not constitute hearsay because it was offered for the purpose of showing the beneficiary’s state of mind.

State v. Simes, 12 Idaho 310, 85 P. 914 (1906); State v. Cosler, 39 Idaho 519, 228 P. 277 (1924).

        Allowing witness to testify without examination as to mental capacity is not reversible error where record discloses that witness was competent. State v. Sims, 35 Idaho 505, 206 P. 1045 (1922).

       <p>
        Unsoundness of mind is relative term. There is no valid reason why one who is capable of receiving and relating impressions should be ordinarily prohibited from testifying, and statute must necessarily have included only those who are so incapable. State v. Cosler, 39 Idaho 519, 228 P. 277 (1924).

        § 9-203. Confidential relations and communications.
       </h3>
       <p>
        There are particular relations in which it is the policy of the law to encourage confidence and to preserve it inviolate; therefore, a person cannot be examined as a witness in the following cases:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t09c02s9-203ol11">
         A husband cannot be examined for or against his wife, without her consent, nor a wife for or against her husband, without his consent; nor can either, during the marriage or afterwards, be, without the consent of the other, examined as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage; but this exception does not apply to a civil action or proceeding by one against the other nor to a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by violence of one against the person of the other, nor does this exception apply to any case of physical injury to a child where the injury has been caused as a result of physical abuse or neglect by one or both of the parents, nor does this exception apply to any case of lewd and lascivious conduct or attempted lewd and lascivious conduct where either party would otherwise be protected by this privilege.
        </li>
        <li id="t09c02s9-203ol12">
         An attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined as to any communication made by the client to him, or his advice given thereon in the course of professional employment. The word client used herein shall be deemed to include a person, a corporation or an association.
        </li>
        <li id="t09c02s9-203ol13">
         A clergyman or priest cannot, without the consent of the person making the confession, be examined as to any confession made to him in his professional character in the course of discipline enjoined by the church to which he belongs.

        <li id="t09c02s9-203ol14">
         A physician or surgeon cannot, without the consent of his patient, be examined in a civil action as to any information acquired in attending the patient which was necessary to enable him to prescribe or act for the patient, provided, however, that:

          <li id="t09c02s9-203ol14A">
           Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to preclude physicians from reporting of and testifying at all cases of physical injury to children, where it appears the injury has been caused as a result of physical abuse or neglect by a parent, guardian or legal custodian of the child.

           After the death of a patient, in any action involving the validity of any will or other instrument executed, or claimed to have been executed, by him, conveying or transferring any real or personal property or incurring any financial obligation, such physician or surgeon may testify to the mental or physical condition of such patient and in so testifying may disclose information acquired by him concerning such patient which was necessary to enable him to prescribe or act for such deceased.
          </li>
          <li id="t09c02s9-203ol14D">
           That where any person or his heirs or representatives brings an action to recover damages for personal injuries or death, such action shall be deemed to constitute a consent by the person bringing such action that any physician who has prescribed for or treated said injured or deceased person and whose testimony is material in the action may testify.
          </li>
          <li id="t09c02s9-203ol14E">
           That if the patient be dead and during his lifetime had not given such consent, the bringing of an action by a beneficiary, assignee or payee or by the legal representative of the insured, to recover on any life, health or accident insurance policy, shall constitute a consent by such beneficiary, assignee, payee or legal representative to the testimony of any physician who attended the deceased.

        Third person who, by accident or by design of attorney, overhears confidential communications between client and attorney may be compelled to divulge what he so hears. Perry v. State, 4 Idaho 224, 38 P. 655 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Communications which pass between one who is merely conveyancer or friendly advisor of grantor or grantee in a deed are not privileged communications under this subdivision. Later v. Haywood, 12 Idaho 78, 85 P. 494 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        When attorney is called as witness and declines to answer a question or produce letters or documents on the ground that same are privileged under provisions of subdivision 2 of this section, burden is upon him to show sufficient facts and circumstances to establish the general privileged character of the communications or documents. The rule does not necessitate attorney disclosing the contents of documents or import of communications, but rather devolves upon him the necessity of showing the relation existing between him and his client at the time communications or documents were received, and circumstances under which he came into possession of same, and that they were obtained by him while acting as attorney for client. In re Niday, 15 Idaho 559, 98 P. 845 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of words “without the consent” of client makes no change in common law, and this section is mere restatement of common law. Sprouse v. Magee, 46 Idaho 622, 269 P. 993 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The admission in evidence of a confidential communication between attorney and client is harmless where the defendant testified to the same state of facts. State v. Johnston, 62 Idaho 601, 113 P.2d 809 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The privilege against self-incrimination, as well as the attorney-client privilege, refers only to communicative and not “real” evidence, and, in a murder prosecution, an order for the defense counsel to produce evidence, which consisted of items burglarized from victim’s home which had been found by defendant’s family, was proper, even though defendant contends that he was, in effect, ordered to incriminate himself through his attorney. State v. Dillon, 93 Idaho 698, 471 P.2d 553 (1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 942, 91 S. Ct. 947, 28 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1971).
    A wife’s attorney’s general statements, such as that wife contacted him, that he arranged to meet with husband’s accountant, and so on, were clearly not privileged since they were not attorney-client communications; nor was any of the affidavit which discussed the meeting with the accountant privileged, for it did not discuss communications, and even if it did they would not be privileged since they were made in the presence of a third person. Compton v. Compton, 101 Idaho 328, 612 P.2d 1175 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order granting independent conflict counsel access to the state appellate public defender’s (SAPD) client file on defendant violated defendant’s attorney-client privilege, because it gave counsel carte blanche to access all of the SAPD’s files relating to its representation of defendant, which undoubtedly contained some privileged information. Hall v. State, 155 Idaho 610, 315 P.3d 798 (2013).

       <p>
        Any communication between an attorney and a potential client subsequent to the attorney’s refusal to handle the individual’s case falls outside the scope of the attorney-client privilege and is admissible. State v. Iwakiri, 106 Idaho 618, 682 P.2d 571 (1984).

        Communications between attorney and client made in the course of professional employment are protected by the attorney-client privilege; the privilege extends to communications made with a view toward employing the attorney by a potential client, whether or not actual employment results. State v. Iwakiri, 106 Idaho 618, 682 P.2d 571 (1984).

       </h5>
       <p>
        As at common law, the “consent” of the client to disclosure of confidential communications under subdivision 2 may be either express or implied from the conduct of the client, and when such consent is found, the privilege is said to have been “waived.” Skelton v. Spencer, 98 Idaho 417, 565 P.2d 1374 (1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 98 S. Ct. 730, 54 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a client who was challenging a settlement agreement testified as to her communications with her attorneys throughout the settlement process thereby making privileged communications an issue of her defense, she waived the attorney-client privilege for all communications relevant to the settlement process and the conduct of her former attorneys, and those attorneys were properly permitted to testify with regard to such communications. Skelton v. Spencer, 98 Idaho 417, 565 P.2d 1374 (1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 98 S. Ct. 730, 54 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision 2 of this section provides that an attorney cannot be examined regarding confidential communications made in the course of employment “without the consent of his client.” The statute thus makes it clear that the client is the holder of the privilege; accordingly, only the client can waive the privilege. State v. Iwakiri, 106 Idaho 618, 682 P.2d 571 (1984).

        Where testimony complained of, a deposition of a Catholic priest read into evidence in a divorce proceeding, does not relate to any confession made to the witness in the course of discipline enjoined by the Church but merely consisted of friendly conversations, the priest was not an incompetent witness under our privileged communication statute. Angleton v. Angleton, 84 Idaho 184, 370 P.2d 788 (1962). Communications with Physician.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any information acquired by attending physicians at an operation or gathered from an examination of diseased parts, removed by the operation a considerable time afterwards, is privileged information and cannot be given in evidence without consent of patient. Jones v. Caldwell, 23 Idaho 467, 130 P. 995 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        All statements made to physician by patient for purpose of determining patient’s condition are privileged, although they have nothing to do with patient’s treatment. Brayman v. Russell & Pugh Lumber Co., 31 Idaho 140, 169 P. 932 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well settled that information based upon observation comes within statute, as well as information based upon statements of patient. Fritcher v. Kelley, 34 Idaho 471, 201 P. 1037 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Physician cannot be cross-examined as to extent and permanency of plaintiff’s injuries when such testimony is objected to as privileged. Nelson v. Johnson, 41 Idaho 697, 243 P. 647 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action between husband and wife wherein she testified he had infected her with a venereal disease, she may be compelled in spite of this section to testify what her physician told her with respect thereto. Radermacher v. Radermacher, 59 Idaho 716, 87 P.2d 461 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Questioning of doctor as to what information he secured from patient, as result of his examination at the hospital, was held improper, as privileged, since information was secured by doctor for purpose of treating his patient. Gardner v. Hobbs, 69 Idaho 288, 206 P.2d 539 (1949).

        Stipulation for life insurance waiving provision of this section disqualifying physician from testifying to any information acquired by him while attending his patient is valid, and entitles both beneficiary in the policy and insurer, in action on policy, to call and examine physician who attended insured during his last sickness, and to exact information which, except for such waiver, would be regarded as a privileged communication. Trull v. Modern Woodmen of Am., 12 Idaho 318, 85 P. 1081 (1906).
    Patient may, under provisions of this section, waive her right to secrecy in respect to one of her physicians; such waiver does not operate as waiver of her right to object to the testimony of another of her physicians called by opposing party in the action.

        Where privileged communications are, in the main, brought out on cross-examination beyond matters elicited in chief and when they are proven by other competent witnesses there is no error in their admission. By cross-examining beyond the scope of the direct examination counsel waives benefit of statute. Hartley v. Bohrer, 52 Idaho 72, 11 P.2d 616 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to recover for disability benefits under life policy where the insured, in the application for the policy, stipulated that he waived all provisions of law forbidding his physician from testifying as to any information acquired by him in attending or examining him, the trial court was justified in ordering that certain X-ray pictures, taken by physician in the insured’s employ, be submitted before trial to the insurance company’s physician for examination. Murphy v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 62 Idaho 362, 112 P.2d 993 (1941).

        Witness, who testified in malpractice action, that spinal anesthesia was currently in use by staff physicians in obstetrical cases and produced charts of other patients, could be questioned as to whether the cases referred to were all obstetrical cases, or for other reasons were not comparable to plaintiff’s case. Walker v. Distler, 78 Idaho 38, 296 P.2d 452 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        The testimony of a physician can be elicited only upon grant of a waiver, and upon the death of the patient such right to waive passes to those properly regarded as standing in his place or representing him. In re Goan’s Estate, 83 Idaho 568, 366 P.2d 831 (1961).

        Anyone claiming through the decedent, personal representative, or some, but not all, of the heirs may waive this privilege in respect to medical testimony. In re Goan’s Estate, 83 Idaho 568, 366 P.2d 831 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since no privilege existed at common law, privilege being a creation of statute, and privilege being personal to the patient, the statute contemplating waiver by the patient himself, upon death of the patient, becomes inoperative; therefore, it would no longer bind the physician or surgeon to the privilege.

        The clear expressed intent of the legislature must be given effect in the permitting of a wife to testify against her husband in cases of criminal violence upon one by the other and there is no occasion to construe this to mean that a serious wrong against the minor child of a wife is a crime against the wife sufficient to remove her disqualification as a witness. State v. Riley, 83 Idaho 346, 362 P.2d 1075 (1961).
    The amendment of subdivision 1 of this section to exclude from the privilege cases “of physical injury to a child where the injury has been caused as a result of physical abuse or neglect by one or both of the parents” does not amend<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c30s19-3002" target="_blank">§ 19-3002 </a></cite>by implication so as to permit a wife to testify against her husband in a prosecution for lewd conduct with a minor female.

       <p>
        In any civil or criminal action in which any witness or a party does not understand or speak the English language, or who has a physical disability which prevents him from fully hearing or speaking the English language, then the court shall appoint a qualified interpreter to interpret the proceedings to and the testimony of such witness or party. Upon appointment of such interpreter, the court shall cause to have the interpreter served with a subpoena as other witnesses, and such interpreter shall be sworn to accurately and fully interpret the testimony given at the hearing or trial to the best of his ability before assuming his duties as an interpreter. The court shall determine a reasonable fee for all such interpreter services which shall be paid out of the district court fund.

       <p>
        An interpreter is considered a witness in the sense that the accuracy of her translation is a question of fact for the jury which may be disputed by counsel. State v. Puente-Gomez, 121 Idaho 702, 827 P.2d 715 (Ct. App. 1992).

       <p>
        Where the victim of a homicide was a Chinese, unfamiliar with the English language, and his purported dying statement was interpreted by a Chinese interpreter and taken down in shorthand by a stenographer, evidence of the fact that the interpreter was addicted to the use of opium or other drugs was competent for the purpose of showing the mental balance of such interpreter, and his capacity to remember the questions that were propounded by the prosecuting attorney through him to the deceased, and the deceased’s answers thereto as the admissibility of such purported dying declaration depended on the truthfulness and accuracy of the interpretation of such questions and answers.

        In defendant’s assault on an officer trial, having appointed an interpreter to be readily available to assist defendant if necessary, the district court was under no obligation to constantly monitor the use which defendant and trial counsel made of the interpreter.

       <p>
        Failure to swear an interpreter is not reversible error per se, and the testimony provided by an unsworn interpreter is not nullified by a lack of oath; failure to require an oath of an interpreter does not require reversal in the absence of a suitable objection at trial.

        Because of claim that he cannot understand English, the state cannot be deprived of the right to cross-examine the defendant in a criminal action, and the state may call witnesses to prove the defendant can speak English, which evidence should be taken, however, out of the presence of the jury. The right to have such evidence heard by the court alone is waived, however, unless request that the jury be excused is made. State v. Bogris, 26 Idaho 587, 144 P. 789 (1914). Cited Murillo v.

        Defendant alleged he was prejudiced by the admission of the exhibit showing that the state board of highway directors fixed and designated 35 miles per hour as the reasonable, safe, prima facie speed limit upon a certain portion of U.S. Highway 30. He could not make a showing of prejudice in view of the uncontradicted evidence to the effect that the section of highway where the collision occurred was in an “urban district” and, as such, 35 miles per hour is the prima facie speed limit thereon.

If the medium chosen for retention is digital, it must be secure against unauthorized or undetected alteration or deletion.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A public seal in this state is a stamp or impression, made by a public officer with an instrument provided by law, to attest the execution of an official or public document, upon the paper or upon any substance attached to the paper, which is capable of receiving a visible impression. A private seal may be made in the same manner by any instrument, or it may be made by the scroll of a pen, or by writing the word “seal” against the signature of the writer. A scroll or other sign made in another state or territory or foreign country, and there recognized as a seal, must be so regarded in this state.

        It is held by many courts that the omission of a required seal is not fatal and is a mere irregularity which may be supplied by amendment and does not render the process or other paper from which it is omitted void, and this is the rule recognized in Idaho.

        The admission of an enlargement of a journal article dealing with the dangers of handling liquid ammonia in an agricultural context and the need for better educational programs was not error, where the article was relevant to show that the president of defendant corporation was on notice of the contents of that article, where proper foundation was laid in showing that the author was an authority in the field and that the president was a member of a society, all of whose members received the journal article, and where the article represented authoritative research on ammonia handling safety measures.

        The federal rules of civil procedure do not permit petitioner to seek the production of memoranda and statements gathered by counsel of adverse party in the course of his activities as counsel. Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S. Ct. 385, 91 L. Ed. 451 (1947) (See Idaho R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)).

        The mere receipt of letters, though on official stationery, is not evidence that they were written by the person whose name they bear. Beloit v. Green, 43 Idaho 265, 251 P. 621 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is no direct knowledge of handwriting, there must be something which assures the recipient of letters in a responsible way of their genuineness before he can swear to their writer. Beloit v. Green, 43 Idaho 265, 251 P. 621 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that a letter purports to be written by the person in question is not sufficient to establish its authenticity. State v. Golden, 67 Idaho 497, 186 P.2d 485 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Letters which are not shown by any evidence to have been in fact signed by their alleged authors, or identified as genuine, are not admissible for any purpose. State v. Golden, 67 Idaho 497, 186 P.2d 485 (1947).
    Where defendant sought to negative certain evidence by introducing a letter in evidence which he had written to a bank and which had been obtained from bank by sheriff, such letter was properly excluded where no representative of the bank was called to identify the letter, its contents, or the writer. State v. Golden, 67 Idaho 497, 186 P.2d 485 (1947).

        For writings, which are not self-authenticating, it is necessary to provide other proof of its genuineness than the mere writing itself before the writing is admissible, and the purported signature or recital of authorship on the face of a writing will not be accepted as sufficient preliminary proof of authenticity for the admission of a writing in evidence.

        That the proof by a witness that a copy of a will is a carbon or duplicate copy of a lost will is the best evidence of the contents of the will does not make such copy the “best evidence” or even admissible on examination of any other witness as to the provisions of the will, unless the witness personally knows it is a carbon or duplicate copy of the alleged lost will.

        The “best evidence” rule, codified as this section and essentially reproduced at Idaho Evid. R. 1002, states a preference in favor of original written instruments — as opposed to copies, testimony, or other secondary sources of information — to prove the terms of a writing; the rule is not applicable if the writing is collateral to testimony about an extrinsic event.

        Parol Evidence Rule.

       <p>
        General rule that written contract can not be contradicted or varied by evidence of oral agreement between parties is especially applicable to cases where bona fide holders of negotiable securities are sought to be deprived of rights to which they were entitled according to legal import of terms of such instruments. Burke v. Dulaney, 153 U.S. 228, 14 S. Ct. 816, 38 L. Ed. 698 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule that excludes parol evidence to contradict written instrument has no application where writing was never delivered as present contract. Burke v. Dulaney, 153 U.S. 228, 14 S. Ct. 816, 38 L. Ed. 698 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of parol proof of contents of check was erroneous where it had gone out of plaintiff’s hands when he cashed it, defendant being entitled to reasonable notice to produce it. Leonard, Crossett & Riley, Inc. v. Whaley, 44 F.2d 692 (9th Cir. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an agreement for sale of property and an addendum were facially ambiguous as to the deadline for buyers to secure financing and complete the sale, district court erred in granting summary judgment to sellers who had repudiated agreement. Parol evidence could be used to resolve this facial ambiguity and determine the intent of the parties. Cannon v. Perry, 144 Idaho 728, 170 P.3d 393 (2007).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a review of the record indicated that the bank made an adequate showing of loss and inability to produce the originals such that secondary evidence of the promissory notes could be admitted in evidence, admission of the photo copies of the notes was not violative of the “best evidence rule.” Idaho First Nat’l Bank v. Wells, 100 Idaho 256, 596 P.2d 429 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court was satisfied with the foundation laid for the necessity and trustworthiness of a photocopy of a ledger-sheet and its admission in evidence, and given the wide discretion allowed to the trial court and the substantial although conflicting evidence upon which the exhibit was admitted, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the exhibit into evidence.

        Where stolen recorder, together with its price tag, was admitted on the basis of the testimony of a management employee, who testified to the authenticity of the tag and that from the price tag code he could approximate the market value of the article, the price tag met the test of relevance in that it, along with the verbal testimony, established the value of the stolen item, which was an essential element of the grand larceny charge. Since the expert testimony concerning the value of the recorder depended largely upon the content of the writing on the price tag, the price tag must be considered hearsay, but even accepting the hearsay character of the price tag admitted in evidence, it fell within the business records exception to the hearsay rule as stated in this section and its admission was not error.

     <p>
      If any business, institution, or member of a profession or calling, in the regular course of business or activity has kept or recorded any memorandum, writing, entry, print, representation or combination thereof, of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, and in the regular course of business has caused any or all of the same to be recorded, copied or reproduced by any photographic, optical imaging, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic, or other process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for so reproducing the original, the original may be destroyed in the regular course of business unless held in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and the principal or true owner has not authorized destruction or unless its preservation is required by law. Such reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, is as admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding whether the original is in existence or not and an enlargement or facsimile of such reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspection under direction of court. The introduction of a reproduced record, enlargement or facsimile, does not preclude admission of the original.

      § 9-420. Proof of hospital medical charts or records by certified copy and compliance with subpoena duces tecum for production thereof.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t09c04s9-420ol11">
       Medical charts or records of hospitals licensed in this state may be proved as to foundation, identity and authenticity by use of a legible and durable copy, certified upon verification by an employee of the hospital charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the originals thereof and empowered by said hospital to make such verified certifications. Said copy may be used in any proceeding in lieu of the original which, however, the hospital shall hold available during the pendency of the cause or proceeding for inspection and comparison by the court, tribunal or hearing officer and by the parties and their attorneys of record. A hospital wishing to avail itself of this section shall at any time prior to the time for proof of said charts and records, place on file with the clerk of the court or with the other body or agency conducting the proceeding a certified copy of a resolution of the governing board of such hospital, authorizing and identifying such employee.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c04s9-420ol12">
       When a subpoena duces tecum is served upon any employee of such a hospital, and requires the production of any such medical charts or records at trial, deposition or any other proceeding, it is sufficient compliance therewith if a hospital employee charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the originals thereof promptly notifies the party causing service of the subpoena, or his attorney of record, together with all other parties to the proceeding in which the subpoena was issued and of which parties he has reasonable notice, or their attorneys of record, of the hospital’s election to proceed under the provisions hereof and of the estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing such charts or records. Following such notification, the hospital employee charged with custodian responsibility for the original charts or records specified in the subpoena shall hold the same available at the hospital, and upon payment to the hospital of said estimated reproduction expenses shall promptly deliver, by mail or otherwise, a true, legible and durable copy of all medical charts or records specified in such subpoena, certified upon his verification, to the clerk of the court before which said proceeding is pending, or to the officer, body or tribunal before which said proceeding is pending if it be not before a court of this state. Such copies shall be delivered after being separately inclosed and sealed in an inner envelope or wrapper, with the title and number of the action, cause or proceeding, the name of such hospital, the name of the hospital employee making such certification and verification and the date of the subpoena clearly inscribed thereon, and the sealed envelope or wrapper shall then be inclosed and sealed in an outer envelope or wrapper, and delivered as aforesaid.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c04s9-420ol13">
       The personal attendance of the hospital employee having custodial responsibility for the original charts or records specified in the subpoena is required if the subpoena contains a clause providing substantially as follows: “The personal attendance of a hospital employee having custodial responsibility for the original charts or records specified herein is required by this subpoena. The procedure outlined in section 9-420, Idaho Code, shall not be sufficient compliance herewith.” If the subpoena duces tecum requires the attendance of a hospital employee in the above manner, said requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the personal attendance of any hospital employee whose name has been lodged with the court or other body as provided in subsection 1 of this section. If personal attendance of a witness is required in the manner herein provided, the hospital may nevertheless elect to substitute true, legible and durable copies of the charts or records specified in the subpoena duces tecum by the giving of a notice of such election in the manner hereinabove set forth, in which case payment to the hospital of the actual and reasonable expenses of duplication of such charts or records by any party to the proceeding in which the subpoena was issued, or such party’s attorney of record, shall be a condition precedent to the personal attendance of any person pursuant to said subpoena, unless otherwise ordered by the court or other body before which said proceeding is pending.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c04s9-420ol14">
       Any patient whose medical records or charts are thus copied and delivered, any person acting on his behalf, the hospital having custody of such records, or any physician, nurse or other person responsible for entries on such charts or records shall have standing to apply to the court or other body before which the cause or proceeding is pending for a protective order denying, restricting or otherwise limiting access and use of such copies or original charts and records. Such patients, persons, hospitals, physicians or nurses who are not parties to the cause or proceeding and who wish to apply for a protective order may petition to intervene in the cause or proceeding and simultaneously apply for such a protective order.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If the hospital has none of the charts or records specified in the subpoena, or only part thereof, an employee having custodial responsibility for original hospital charts or records shall so state in an affidavit and following notice and payment of expenses as hereinabove provided shall hold available such original charts or records as are in the hospital’s custody and specified in the subpoena and shall deliver copies thereof certified upon his verification together with said affidavit, in the manner hereinabove provided.

        Grant of summary judgment in favor of the purchaser in a lawsuit to recover money deposits from the sellers after two codependent land sale contracts involving the parties failed to close was proper, in part because the district court’s citation to this section was irrelevant. The statute of frauds does not come into play; the contracts are integrated, they had not been extended, modified, or renewed by any writing conforming with the amendments and waivers provision, and any argument to the contrary was without merit. Buku Props., LLC v. Clark, 153 Idaho 828, 291 P.3d 1027 (2012).

        The statute of frauds applies to auctions of land in the same manner as any other land transaction. Wakelum v. Hagood, 151 Idaho 688, 263 P.3d 742 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a sale of land is not taken outside the statute of frauds just because it involves an auction, the auction terms agreed upon by the seller, in a writing, can be considered in determining whether the writing satisfies the statute of frauds. Wakelum v. Hagood, 151 Idaho 688, 263 P.3d 742 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        When landowner signed a representation agreement, authorizing an absolute auction of his properties on the terms therein stated, all terms essential to a land sale contract were contained within that agreement. While the representation agreement did not specifically state the purchase price for any parcel, or the name of the buyer or buyers who would submit the highest bid thereon, the agreement contained an appropriate provision for reducing those material terms to certainty.

       </p>
       <p>
        This statute prescribes a rule of evidence, and in the instances enumerated the evidence must be in writing; it was intended to prevent proof in cases where grantors in warranty deeds attempt to contradict the terms of the deed and establish a trust in favor of third parties and to prevent titles becoming subject to capricious memories of interested witnesses.

       <p>
        Trial court erred in granting a parking easement to purchaser of adjoining property, where easement was based on an oral agreement made when purchaser was only a tenant, since this section requires a writing for the creation of such an easement. Fajen v. Powlus, 96 Idaho 625, 533 P.2d 746 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where landowner and owner of adjoining property entered into a written contract whereby adjoining owner agreed to deliver culinary and domestic well water, but where landowner was not granted any right to adjoining owner’s property nor any right to go upon that property, landowner did not acquire an easement by express agreement by which he could implement his contractual right to the delivery of water. Shultz v. Atkins, 97 Idaho 770, 554 P.2d 948 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no express easement to use a road for ingress and egress based on a deed or a sale agreement where the language was insufficient to create such; the parties’ intent was insufficient to substitute for a writing. Tower Asset Sub Inc. v. Lawrence, 143 Idaho 710, 152 P.3d 581 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sale agreement did not create an express easement where it did not indicate an immediate grant of easement rights; the language gave the seller the right to obtain an access easement for the benefit of some other property, and there was no intent to convey any property interest until the balance owing on the sale agreement was paid. Further, a deed did not reserve or except an easement. Capstar Radio Operating Co. v. Lawrence, 143 Idaho 704, 152 P.3d 575 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        At a minimum, a valid express easement must identify the land subject to the easement and express the intent of the parties. Thus, while specific words are not required to create an express easement, the writing must make clear the parties’ intention to establish a servitude. Baker v. KAL, LLC, 163 Idaho 530, 415 P.3d 939 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        An easement is considered to be an encumbrance on real property and, therefore, must be in writing. Sec. Inv’r Fund LLC v. Crumb, — Idaho —, 443 P.3d 1036 (2019).

        Where vendor and vendee entered into a purchase and sale agreement, the terms of which were definite and, in reliance thereto, purchaser changed his position by selling his cattle to his substantial damage, under the principal of equitable estoppel, in order to promote the ends of justice and accomplish that which should be done between the parties, vendor should be, and is, estopped to deny vendee’s right to purchase the subject property in accord with the terms of the agreement which the trial court found and determined to be the agreement between the parties. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
    A defendant who is induced to rely on an oral agreement and who changes position to his own detriment cannot be defrauded by a plaintiff who interposes the statute of frauds to declare the agreement invalid. Idaho Migrant Council, Inc. v. Northwestern Mut. Ins. Co., 110 Idaho 804, 718 P.2d 1242 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiffs and vendor of defendant had orally agreed to sale of disputed property, plaintiffs had taken possession of the disputed land, exercised control over it for approximately three years, made substantial improvements thereon, and paid vendor $1,200 of the $1,500 sale price, and where the actual parties to the agreement testified to its essential terms, the description of the land was certain and was based on uncontradicted testimony, and after the second payment of $600 vendor gave plaintiffs a receipt stating who the parties were and that $1,200 had been received in payment for the disputed land leaving a balance of $300 to be paid, such evidence was clear and convincing; therefore, district court did not err in concluding that defendant was estopped from raising the statute of frauds to avoid enforcement of the oral agreement and court’s order that the agreement be specifically enforced was proper. Mikesell v. Newworld Dev. Corp., 122 Idaho 868, 840 P.2d 1090 (Ct. App. 1992).

        The evidence produced by an occupant of land did not establish the essential terms of an oral lease with sufficient definiteness and certainty so as to avoid the strictures of the statute of frauds nor was the part performance of the agreement sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the equitable remedy of specific enforcement.

        In a title insurance dispute, limited liability company owned by insureds, to which they had conveyed the property by a properly executed warranty deed, was not considered to have obtained title to the property by operation of law and, thus, was not an insured under the policy. Point of Rocks Ranch, LLC v. Sun Valley Title Ins. Co., 143 Idaho 411, 146 P.3d 677 (2006). Oral Agreement.

        An oral agreement to substitute the mode or time of performance of an executory contract required to be in writing is valid and binding, provided that no other material term is changed and the agreement is made before the expiration of the written contract. Kelly v. Hodges, 119 Idaho 872, 811 P.2d 48 (Ct. App. 1991).

Thus, where it was undisputed that plaintiffs had taken possession of the disputed property under oral agreement, exercised exclusive control over it for approximately three years, made substantial improvements thereon and paid most of the purchase price, vendors were estopped from raising the statute of frauds as a defense to liability under the agreement. Mikesell v. Newworld Dev. Corp., 122 Idaho 868, 840 P.2d 1090 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Because the real property contract was subject to the statute of frauds, gaps in essential terms regarding the security agreement could not be filled by parol evidence. Lawrence v. Jones, 124 Idaho 748, 864 P.2d 194 (Ct. App. 1993).

        In a matter involving an appeal from a failed venture to develop a Christian retreat ranch, an oral contract existed, but there was no violation of the statute of frauds as the oral contract was for the formation of a partnership for the purpose of developing the Christian retreat ranch, not an oral contract for the sale of land, which transaction was incidental to the oral contract. Spence v. Howell, 126 Idaho 763, 890 P.2d 714 (1995).

        Where the parties agreed to lease a particular parcel of farmland for a term of five years at a certain yearly rent, where the plaintiff agreed to pay for water assessment, electricity and property taxes, and where there was partial performance of the contract, there was sufficient evidence to show that the oral agreement was taken outside of the statute of frauds and was enforceable.

        Where grantor conveyed property pursuant to prior oral agreement, with agreement that grantee would reconvey after performance of certain conditions and grantee fully performed her part of the agreement, the statute of frauds did not preclude enforcement of the agreement.

       </p>
       <p>
        Oral agreement by which decedent promised to devise certain real estate to plaintiff if she did not file claim against certain estate and “stayed by him” will be enforced by specific performance and is not within the statute of frauds where there is partial or complete performance of the agreement. McMahon v. Auger, 83 Idaho 27, 357 P.2d 374 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that an amount of $619.95 originally considered as rental payments had been paid to apply on the purchase price, such payment did not by itself constitute such part performance as to justify specific performance of the oral contract, since it was only a small part of the $25,000 purchase price. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Competent evidence may clearly show that possession, after the making of an oral contract, was definitely referable to the contract; however, the possession of land to constitute part performance of a contract which would be invalid under the statute of frauds must be actual, notorious and in pursuance of the contract. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even when a party was entitled to specific performance because his possession after Jan. 1, 1958, was referable to the oral contract under the evidence, the court did not find that it was such a possession as constituted part performance. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to be considered as constituting part performance of a contract, improvements must be substantial in relation to the value of the property involved. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
    In view of the fact that the trial court did not determine what loss was in fact suffered by respondent as a result of marketing his cattle when he did in reliance on an oral contract, nor whether the legal remedy would be inadequate, the court did not feel that such collateral act under the circumstances in this case should be regarded as part performance. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        What constitutes part performance must depend upon the particular facts of each case and the sufficiency of particular actions is a matter of law. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where possession is relied upon as part performance to take the case out of the statute of frauds, the taking of the possession is of great importance and the continuance of a possession assumed or commenced before the making of a contract under some right or in some capacity is not such a taking and holding of possession as may alone, or in connection with other acts, be regarded as part performance of the contract. Boesiger v. Freer, 85 Idaho 551, 381 P.2d 802 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there has been full or partial performance of a contract normally within the statute of frauds, such a contract is nonetheless valid where the remedy sought is specific performance. Tew v. Manwaring, 94 Idaho 50, 480 P.2d 896 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where practically all the individual terms of the original contract, accord and satisfaction had been performed except the delivery of the deed, the court properly decreed specific performance though the agreement to transfer the real estate was oral. Brown v. Burnside, 94 Idaho 363, 487 P.2d 957 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where partial performance has occurred under a contract for the sale of real estate, the trial court has the discretion to compel specific performance, despite the lack of written evidence of the parties’ agreement. Jolley v. Clay, 103 Idaho 171, 646 P.2d 413 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that the purchasers took possession of the property based on an oral contract and lived upon it as owners for 15 years, that they made improvements upon the property valued at $10,000, or roughly the amount of the purchase price, that purchasers paid the taxes on the property from 1964 to 1975, and that they paid $5,500 of the $10,000 purchase price, there was unquestionably part performance sufficient to take the contract out of the statute of frauds. Jolley v. Clay, 103 Idaho 171, 646 P.2d 413 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment for specific performance of an oral contract to convey land was upheld because there was clear and convincing evidence of the oral agreement, there was partial performance by the brother, and the map of the property was sufficiently drawn to describe the property under the provisions of this section. Thorn Springs Ranch, Inc. v. Smith, 137 Idaho 480, 50 P.3d 975 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute regarding an oral agreement for the sale of land between two tenants in common, the part performance exception did not allow for specific performance since the alleged contract was not definite regarding what property was included in the sale.

        Courts of equity have power to so reform an executory contract valid and binding on its face as to make the statements speak the truth as it was intended, but have no power to construct an executory agreement for parties or to insert therein new and essential elements or matter that is required by the statute to be reduced to writing in order to make contract valid and binding. Allen v. Kitchen, 16 Idaho 133, 100 P. 1052 (1909).
    Executory contract for sale of real estate, which fails to designate the state, county, civil, or political district in which land is situated, and fails to disclose the municipal or other subdivision to which the tract of land is an “addition,” is insufficient and void description and cannot be supplied or aided by parol evidence. Allen v. Kitchen, 16 Idaho 133, 100 P. 1052 (1909). But see Barnhart v. Hansen, 36 Idaho 419, 211 P. 438 (1922).

        Legal description in a real estate purchase agreement was insufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds; while it might be possible for someone to identify the property being conveyed by referring to the descriptions in the tax notices that were referenced in an addendum to the purchase agreement, one could not tell exactly what property was being conveyed merely by the descriptions. Additionally, the description in the exclusive seller representation agreement, which only contained the home address and the appropriate acreage being sold, was insufficient to meet the statutory requirements of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.54.html#t54c20s54-2050" target="_blank">§§ 54-2050</a></cite>(1)(b) or this section.

        Verbal contract for sale or transfer of real estate is not admissible in evidence to establish title against a stranger to contract. McGinness v. Stanfield, 6 Idaho 372, 55 P. 1020 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Written contract for sale of real property may be modified by a subsequent oral agreement, but where it is claimed that oral agreement modifies the terms of a written contract, evidence to establish such oral agreement should be clear and satisfactory. Prairie Dev. Co. v. Leiberg, 15 Idaho 379, 98 P. 616 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Oral agreement for transfer of real property is void, where not evidenced by any written instrument or delivery of possession of real property. Schulz v. Hansing, 36 Idaho 121, 209 P. 727 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        The complaint sufficiently stated a cause of action where former realty owners against whom mortgage had been foreclosed alleged an agreement had been entered into with junior lienholder that latter was to redeem property on last day of redemption period and that former owners were then to secure a purchaser for such realty and personal property located thereon, they to be compensated for such services by the grant of certain parcels of land, but buyer and junior lienholder in violation of such oral agreement consummated the sale depriving former owners of agreed compensation. Harvey v. Brown, 80 Idaho 379, 330 P.2d 982 (1958).
    Oral sales of real property are void. Good v. Hansen, 110 Idaho 953, 719 P.2d 1213 (Ct. App. 1986).

        Water Rights.

       <p>
        A water right is defined, not in terms of metes and bounds as in other real property, but in terms of the priority, amount, season of use, purpose of use, point of diversion, and place of use and a compromise, in a stipulation to settle a water rights dispute, to change or exchange any of these definitional factors would be identical to a compromise to change or exchange a portion of the metes and bounds description of real property and, as such, would fall directly within the statute of frauds. Olson v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Resources, 105 Idaho 98, 666 P.2d 188 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where oral stipulation to settle water rights dispute changed existing water rights by reshuffling priority dates and changing amounts of use, such stipulation was a contract falling within the statute of frauds and, if still executory, was unenforceable. Olson v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Resources, 105 Idaho 98, 666 P.2d 188 (1983).

        Where plaintiffs and vendor of defendant had orally agreed to sale of disputed property, plaintiffs had taken possession of the disputed land, exercised control over it for approximately three years, made substantial improvements thereon, and paid vendor $1,200 of the $1,500 sale price, and where the actual parties to the agreement testified to its essential terms, the description of the land was certain and was based on uncontradicted testimony, and after the second payment of $600 vendor gave plaintiffs a receipt stating who the parties were and that $1,200 had been received in payment for the disputed land leaving a balance of $300 to be paid, such evidence was clear and convincing; therefore, district court did not err in concluding that defendant was estopped from raising the statute of frauds to avoid enforcement of the oral agreement and court’s order that the agreement be specifically enforced was proper. Mikesell v. Newworld Dev. Corp., 122 Idaho 868, 840 P.2d 1090 (Ct. App. 1992).

       <p>
        An oral contract for the conveyance of real property or under which the title thereto is acquired may be enforced, is binding upon the parties thereto, and is not within the statute of frauds, where there is partial or complete performance of the same. Stowell v. Tucker, 7 Idaho 312, 62 P. 1033 (1900); Feeney v. Chester, 7 Idaho 324, 63 P. 192 (1900); Male v. Leflang, 7 Idaho 348, 63 P. 108 (1900); Francis v.

Part Performance.

        The doctrine of part performance has frequently been invoked by lessees against lessors. Fry v. Weyen, 58 Idaho 181, 70 P.2d 359 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Oral agreement by which decedent promised to devise certain real estate to plaintiff if she did not file claim against certain estate and “stayed by him” will be enforced by specific performance and is not within the statute of frauds, where there is partial or complete performance of the agreement. McMahon v. Auger, 83 Idaho 27, 357 P.2d 374 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Extension of a lease by oral agreement did not constitute part performance of the option to purchase by a certain time in the original lease so as to take it out of the statute of frauds. Southern v. Southern, 92 Idaho 180, 438 P.2d 925 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        An oral agreement to devise certain land to the owner in consideration of his sale of it to the party for a lower price than he had been offered by others was brought within the exceptions of this section by the owner’s fulfillment of the agreement by sale and conveyance of land as agreed. Quayle v. Mackert, 92 Idaho 563, 447 P.2d 679 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where practically all the individual terms of the original contract, accord and satisfaction had been performed except the delivery of the deed, the court properly decreed specific performance though the agreement to transfer the real estate was oral. Brown v. Burnside, 94 Idaho 363, 487 P.2d 957 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant who is induced to rely on an oral agreement and changes position, through partial performance, to his own detriment cannot be defrauded by a plaintiff who interposes the statute of frauds to declare the agreement invalid. Roundy v. Waner, 98 Idaho 625, 570 P.2d 862 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parents invited their daughter and her husband to purchase certain property and the daughter and her spouse, relying on the oral agreement, made extensive repairs to the property and paid a number of the parents’ debts, their part performance took the transaction out of the statute of frauds and justified the trial court’s decision to quiet title in the daughter and her husband. Roundy v. Waner, 98 Idaho 625, 570 P.2d 862 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where partial performance has occurred under a contract for the sale of real estate, the trial court has the discretion to compel specific performance, despite the lack of written evidence of the parties’ agreement. Jolley v. Clay, 103 Idaho 171, 646 P.2d 413 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that the purchasers took possession of the property based on an oral contract and lived upon it as owners for 15 years, that they made improvements upon the property valued at $10,000, or roughly the amount of the purchase price, that purchasers paid the taxes on the property from 1964 to 1975, and that they paid $5,500 of the $10,000 purchase price, there was unquestionably part performance sufficient to take the contract out of the statute of frauds. Jolley v. Clay, 103 Idaho 171, 646 P.2d 413 (1982).

        Although<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c05s9-503" target="_blank">§ 9-503 </a></cite>requires that a conveyance of real property must be in writing, this section provides an exception to the rule so long as partial acceptance has occurred. Thus, where it was undisputed that plaintiffs had taken possession of the disputed property under oral agreement, exercised exclusive control over it for approximately three years, made substantial improvements thereon and paid most of the purchase price, vendors were estopped from raising the statute of frauds as a defense to liability under the agreement. Mikesell v. Newworld Dev. Corp., 122 Idaho 868, 840 P.2d 1090 (Ct. App. 1992).
    The evidence produced by an occupant of land did not establish the essential terms of an oral lease with sufficient definiteness and certainty so as to avoid the strictures of the statute of frauds, nor was the part performance of the agreement sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the equitable remedy of specific enforcement. Wing v. Munns, 123 Idaho 493, 849 P.2d 954 (Ct. App. 1993).

Hinkle v. Winey, 126 Idaho 993, 895 P.2d 594 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Doctrine of part performance could not make an oral contract for the purchase of real property subject to specific enforcement, where the absence of a meeting of the minds on a material provision supported the conclusion that no contract had been formed by the parties. Chapin v. Linden, 144 Idaho 393, 162 P.3d 772 (2007).

        This section provides for a part-performance exception only to the general statute of frauds provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c05s9-503" target="_blank">§ 9-503</a></cite>. It has no application to the statutes regulating real estate brokers and agents found in Title 54, Chapter 20, Idaho Code. Johnson v. McPhee, 147 Idaho 455, 210 P.3d 563 (Ct. App. 2009).

        Resulting trust arises by operation of law in favor of person who advances purchase-money for land, though title be taken in name of another; or in favor of person for whom it is advanced by way of a loan, title being taken in the name of lender. Such trust, being one which results by implication or construction of law, does not fall within provisions of the statute of frauds and may be established by parol evidence. Pittock v. Pittock, 15 Idaho 426, 98 P. 719 (1908); Coughanour v. Grayson, 19 Idaho 255, 113 P. 724 (1911).
       </p>

        This section empowers the court to decree a resulting trust where a party fails to establish an express trust, since a resulting trust may be established by parol evidence. Aker v. Aker, 52 Idaho 713, 20 P.2d 796, cert. denied, 290 U.S. 587, 54 S. Ct. 80, 78 L. Ed. 518 (1933).

        A defendant’s admission of an unwritten contract during the course of litigation will prevent the defendant from relying upon the statute of frauds, if the acknowledgement is of the exact alleged contract and not just evidence of some agreed terms.

        The statute of frauds is inapplicable when a contract, although not fully performed by both sides, is mutually acknowledged to exist. Frantz v. Parke, 111 Idaho 1005, 729 P.2d 1068 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “full” performance means performance of all obligations by both sides to a contract; it is universally recognized that the statute of frauds is inapplicable to a contract fully performed by both sides. Frantz v. Parke, 111 Idaho 1005, 729 P.2d 1068 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section generally requires a written promise; however, an exception exists when the promise is original or independent from, and not merely collateral to, the agreement between the promisee and a third-party debtor since an original obligation of the promisor is not covered by the terms of the statute of frauds. Treasure Valley Plumbing & Heating, Inc. v. Earth Resources Co., 115 Idaho 373, 766 P.2d 1254 (Ct. App. 1988).

        A contract dispute between a pension services company and a home builder, who developed a subdivision with a loan of funds from the pension company, related to the repayment terms of the loan and not to the sale of property; thus, the provisions of this section were not applicable. Am. Pension Servs. v. Cornerstone Home Builders, Llc, 147 Idaho 638, 213 P.3d 1038 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because an employer’s promise to answer for a newly hired employee’s loan obligation to her previous employer directly benefitted the new employer, the agreement is an exception to the statute of frauds requirement of written evidence.

        Subsection (2) did not apply to a vice president’s breach of contract claim, where he alleged that an investment advisory company and his employer assumed joint liability for his compensation as original obligors, the record supported those allegations, and there was triable issue of fact as to whether the advisory company intended to bind itself to pay the vice president’s compensation.

       <p>
        Where the location of true boundary line between coterminous owners is unknown to either party and is uncertain or in dispute, an oral agreement between them fixing the boundary line is not regarded as a conveyance of real property in violation of the statute of frauds, but merely as the location of respective existing estates and the common boundary of each of the parties. Downing v. Boehringer, 82 Idaho 52, 349 P.2d 306 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the location of a true boundary line between coterminous owners is known to either of the parties, or is not uncertain and not in dispute, oral agreement between them purporting to establish another line between them as the boundary between their properties constitutes an attempt to convey real property in violation of statute of frauds and is invalid. Downing v. Boehringer, 82 Idaho 52, 349 P.2d 306 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the location of the true boundary line between coterminous owners is unknown, uncertain or in dispute, the coterminous owners may orally agree upon a boundary line, and the agreement, when possession is taken under it, will be binding upon the owners and those claiming under them and will not violate the statute of frauds for lack of a writing because it is not a conveyance of land, but merely the locating and establishing of the common boundary. Hyde v. Lawson, 94 Idaho 886, 499 P.2d 1242 (1972), overruled on other grounds, Nesbitt v. Wolfkiel, 100 Idaho 396, 598 P.2d 1046 (1979).
    In every case where a boundary by agreement is asserted, the underlying issue is whether such an agreement represents an oral conveyance of land in violation of the statute of frauds. The general rule of case law is that an agreement which arises from uncertainty or dispute over the location of a boundary is valid and does not constitute an oral conveyance of land. Norwood v. Stevens, 104 Idaho 44, 655 P.2d 938 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mediation agreement fell within the boundary agreement exception to statute of frauds, the elements of which are: (1) an uncertain or disputed boundary and (2) an express or implied agreement subsequently fixing that boundary. Goodman v. Lothrop, 143 Idaho 622, 151 P.3d 818 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        An oral agreement purporting to establish a new boundary line between two properties, and thus transfer land from one owner to another, would violate the statute of frauds. Fischer v. Croston, 163 Idaho 331, 413 P.3d 731 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is an exception to the general rule that an agreement to convey real estate is invalid under the statute of frauds unless it is committed to writing, where such an agreement qualifies as a boundary by agreement. This exception is permitted because such an agreement does not constitute an oral conveyance of land. The two requirements for a boundary by agreement are: an uncertain or disputed boundary and an express or implied agreement as to the new boundary. Fischer v. Croston, 163 Idaho 331, 413 P.3d 731 (2018).

        Where there was no evidence at the trial court level to indicate that defendants concealed from buyer a “no sale” policy regarding lot in question, there was no knowingly false statement or concealment of a material fact sufficient to entitle plaintiffs to enforcement of an oral contract under a theory of equitable estoppel. Hoffman v. SV Co., 102 Idaho 187, 628 P.2d 218 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Promissory estoppel was not properly invoked as a defense to Idaho’s statute of frauds, in a case dealing with a bank promising to lend money above the statutory amount, where borrower never proved that the bank made any false representations or concealed any material facts with actual or constructive knowledge of the truth. Kimmes v. D.L. Evans Bank (In re Kimmes), 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 543 (Bankr. D. Idaho Feb. 10, 2014), aff’d, Kimmes v. D.L. Evans Bank (In re Kimmes), 528 B.R. 436 (D. Idaho 2015).

       <p>
        When consideration of a party’s promise is for money to be furnished to or received by a third person, if transaction be such that third person remains responsible to person who furnishes him with such money, such promise is collateral and, under the statute of frauds, will not bind the party unless it be in writing. Storer v. Heitfeld, 19 Idaho 170, 113 P. 80 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is no allegation in complaint that third person was responsible to person who furnished him with money, or that defendant was to pay debt or default of third person, or that there was any personal liability on his part to do so, transaction is not brought within provisions of this section. Hoy v. Anderson, 39 Idaho 430, 227 P. 1058 (1924).
    While evidence to answer for debt or default of another must be in writing, no such rule obtains where party treats debt as his own. Kelly v. Arave, 41 Idaho 723, 243 P. 366 (1925).

        Where the shareholders of a corporation had mutually agreed to pay attorney’s fees, such agreement was made separately and remotely from earlier written promises to guarantee the obligations of the corporation, and the defense of the lawsuits in question was for the benefit of the shareholders in their personal capacities, the oral agreement that obligated each shareholder to pay one-third of the attorney’s fees incurred for the defense of lawsuits against the corporation was an original one under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c05s9-506" target="_blank">§ 9-506</a></cite>, rather than a collateral agreement within the terms of subdivision 2 of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        The transaction in question was taken out of the statute of frauds because it had been partially executed by the transfer of the property to the defendant by two of the debtors, where when judgment became a lien upon the land, two of the three judgment debtors sold to the purchaser, the purchaser while failing to do so having orally agreed to pay the judgment, the creditor thereupon levying upon sums of such third debtor to satisfy the judgment.

        Sufficient part performance by a purchaser of real property removes the contract from the operation of the statute of frauds, and although the equitable doctrine of part performance is inapplicable to an action at law, satisfaction of the doctrine of part performance would entitle the purchaser to specific performance.

        Where city’s approval of subdivision of property was a condition precedent to the existence of any contract, oral or written, for the sale of property and purchasers were willing to assume expense of securing subdivision as part of negotiation costs, purchasers’ actions in having property surveyed and submitting subdivision plat did not constitute possession, either actual or pursuant to oral agreement, sufficient to establish part performance and remove oral contract from the statute of frauds; moreover, the cost of securing subdivision approval ($436) was not substantial enough in relation to the $90,000 value of the property to establish part performance. Hoffman v. SV Co., 102 Idaho 187, 628 P.2d 218 (1981).

        Where employee’s reliance when accepting his job transfer and taking out interest-free home equity loan was no less referable to the loan agreement itself, and to comply policies identified in the record, than to the oral agreement by employer to buy employee’s house and where no acts separately referable to the oral agreement have been demonstrated, there was no part performance sufficient to take the agreement out of the statute of frauds. IBM Corp. v. Lawhorn, 106 Idaho 194, 677 P.2d 507 (Ct. App. 1984).
    Where purchaser did not take possession of the property or make any improvements thereof, nor paid taxes thereon, there was no part performance which would take oral contract for sale of land out of the statute of frauds. Hemingway v. Gruener, 106 Idaho 422, 679 P.2d 1140 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Part performance, when established, yields an equitable remedy — specific performance of the oral agreement by the other party; accordingly, where employee did not seek by his counterclaim to enforce oral agreement for a sale of property to employer, the doctrine of part performance as an exception to statute of frauds would yield a remedy unsuited to the purpose for which the doctrine was urged and court would not apply it. IBM Corp. v. Lawhorn, 106 Idaho 194, 677 P.2d 507 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In some circumstances, an oral agreement may be removed from the strictures of the statute of frauds by part or full performance; the exception protects a party who demonstrates reliance upon an oral contract by acts that would not have been done except for the contract. However, such reliance cannot be established by conduct referable to a cause other than the oral contract. IBM Corp. v. Lawhorn, 106 Idaho 194, 677 P.2d 507 (Ct. App. 1984).

        Where oral contract of employment was to continue for a period of seven years from Dec. 1, 1959, the fact that employee was working under such agreement from Oct. 24, 1959, until his arrest by his employer on Dec. 11, 1959, and as an added part performance of such contract had moved his family to the place of his employment, would not validate the agreement, which by its terms was not to be performed within one year and was not in writing.

        Where labor union agreement failed to mention the duration period to discuss terms of payment and to denote the parties, the agreement was not a memorandum or writing embodying the oral agreement and, therefore, it was irrelevant to the oral contract under which plaintiff claimed damages.

        If, under an oral employment contract, the employee was hired for a fixed period coterminous with the 30-year lease on the plant site, then the fixed period would place his employment contract squarely within the statute of frauds. Whitlock v. Haney Seed Co., 110 Idaho 347, 715 P.2d 1017 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the oral employment agreement contained both a condition, satisfactory performance by the employee, and a contingency, any extrinsic event such as change in company ownership, cessation of plant operations, or expiration of the plant lease, the contract did not fall within the statute of frauds because of the contingency, even if satisfactory performance is not a type of condition which obviates the statute of frauds. Whitlock v. Haney Seed Co., 110 Idaho 347, 715 P.2d 1017 (Ct. App. 1986).
    The statute of frauds barred enforcement of the noncompetition clause because plaintiff never signed the proposed employment contract, and the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate equitable estoppel, or that defendant admitted the contract.

       </p>
       <p>
        The doctrine of full performance by one party, like the doctrine of part performance, does not take the contract out of the statute of frauds; rather, it should be treated as a form of equitable estoppel. Frantz v. Parke, 111 Idaho 1005, 729 P.2d 1068 (Ct. App. 1986).

        An oral agreement to substitute the mode or time of performance of an executory contract required to be in writing is valid and binding, provided that no other material term is changed and the agreement is made before the expiration of the written contract.

        For a valid gift of real property, there must be a “conveyance or other instrument in writing” subscribed by the party to be charged. If made by an agent of the party to be charged, such authority must also be in writing. Although no particular instrument is necessary to constitute a note or memorandum required by the statute of frauds, the essential terms of an oral gift must be contained in the writing or writings. Erb v. Kohnke, 121 Idaho 328, 824 P.2d 903 (Ct. App. 1992).

        In a matter involving an appeal from a failed venture to develop a Christian retreat ranch, an oral contract existed, but there was no violation of the statute of frauds as the oral contract was for the formation of a partnership for the purpose of developing a Christian retreat ranch, not an oral contract for the sale of land, which transaction was incidental to the oral contract.

        The plain language of subsection 5 does not mandate that all terms of a loan agreement and associated security arrangements be in writing; therefore, the oral agreement to lengthen plaintiff’s time for performance under the promissory note and to modify defendant’s collection rights under the security agreements did not alter defendant’s promise to lend money and were not subject to the statute of frauds.

Even though the parties to the loan did not create a writing which outlined the terms of the loan, this section allows the use of verbal contracts that can be performed in less than a year, and both the parents and the debtors believed that the loan would be repaid in less than a year.

        Although an agreement for the sale of real property was reduced to writing several times, it never was signed by the party to be charged and, consequently, there was no enforceable agreement. Wolske Bros. v. Hudspeth Sawmill Co., 116 Idaho 714, 779 P.2d 28 (Ct. App. 1989).

       <p>
        The defense of the statute of frauds is waived where it does not appear from the complaint that the contract sued on does not fall within it, and the party relying on the statute as a defense fails to plead it. Slusser v. Aumock, 56 Idaho 793, 59 P.2d 723 (1936); Magee v. Winn, 52 Idaho 553, 16 P.2d 1062 (1932).

       <p>
        Even though it would have been a better practice for the plaintiff lessee to have raised the affirmative defense of the statute of frauds in her reply to the defendant lessor’s counterclaim or to have requested an amendment, where the defendant knew of the affirmative defense and was given time to present argument in opposition to the defense, the plaintiff did not waive her right to raise the statute of frauds defense by first raising it in a summary judgment motion.

        Failure to plead the defense of the statute of frauds in the amended answer acts as a waiver of the defense and all objections based on it; therefore, defendant’s failure to first present the statute of frauds issue to the trial court for resolution precludes consideration of the question on appeal. Ernst v. Hemenway & Moser Co., 120 Idaho 941, 821 P.2d 996 (Ct. App. 1991), modified, 126 Idaho 980, 895 P.2d 581 (1995). Water Rights.

        A water right is defined, not in terms of metes and bounds as in other real property, but in terms of the priority, amount, season of use, purpose of use, point of diversion, and place of use and a compromise, in a stipulation to settle a water rights dispute, to change or exchange any of these definitional factors would be identical to a compromise to change or exchange a portion of the metes and bounds description of real property and, as such, would fall directly within the statute of frauds. Olson v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Resources, 105 Idaho 98, 666 P.2d 188 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where oral stipulation to settle water rights dispute changed existing water rights by reshuffling priority dates and changing amounts of use, such stipulation was a contract falling within the statute of frauds and, if still executory, was unenforceable.

        District court erred in granting summary judgment to the prospective purchasers of lot on the basis that the sale agreement was unenforceable because the seller’s original agent did not have written authority to sign the agreement as required by subdivision 5 of this section prior to the signing, because, although there was not an express ratification of the agreement before the prospective purchasers declined the purchase, the agreement was enforceable as the closing documents were signed by the president and the secretary acting as valid agents of the seller before the purchaser declined to purchase the property.

      A promise to answer for the obligation of another, in any of the following cases, is deemed an original obligation of the promisor, and need not be in writing:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t09c05s9-506ol11">
       Where the promise is made by one who has received property of another upon an undertaking to apply it pursuant to such promise; or by one who has received a discharge from an obligation in whole or in part, in consideration of such promise.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c05s9-506ol12">
       Where the creditor parts with value, or enters into an obligation, in consideration of the obligations in respect to which the promise is made, in terms or under circumstances such as to render the party making the promise the principal debtor, and the person in whose behalf it is made, his surety.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c05s9-506ol13">
       Where the promise, being for an antecedent obligation of another, is made upon the consideration that the party receiving it cancels the antecedent obligation, accepting the new promise as a substitute therefor; or upon the consideration that the party receiving it releases the property of another from a levy, or his person from imprisonment under an execution on a judgment obtained upon the antecedent obligation; or upon a consideration beneficial to the promisor, whether moving from either party to the antecedent obligation, or from another person.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c05s9-506ol14">

        Because an employer’s promise to answer for a newly hired employee’s loan obligation to her previous employer directly benefitted the new employer, the agreement is an exception to the statute of frauds requirement of written evidence.

        If consideration of party’s promise is for money to be furnished or received by third person, such promise is collateral, where the transaction is such that third person remains answerable to person who furnishes him with such money; such promise will not, therefore, bind party unless it is in writing.

       </p>
       <p>
        The transaction in question was taken out of the statute of frauds because it had been partially executed by the transfer of the property to the defendant by two of the debtors, where, when judgment became a lien upon the land two of the three judgment debtors sold to the purchaser, the purchaser while failing to do so having orally agreed to pay the judgment, the creditor thereupon levying upon sums of such third debtor to satisfy the judgment.

       <p>
        Section 9-505 generally requires a written promise; however, an exception exists when the promise is original or independent from, and not merely collateral to, the agreement between the promisee and the third-party debtor since an original obligation of the promisor is not covered by the terms of the statute of frauds.

        Under subdivision 3, promise to answer for the obligation of another is deemed an original obligation of promisor and need not be in writing, where promise is for an antecedent obligation of another and is made upon the consideration that party receiving it cancels the antecedent obligation and accepts the new promise as a substitute therefor. McCallum v. McClarren, 15 Idaho 374, 98 P. 200 (1908).
    Where one corporation has purchased all the property and rights of another corporation, and, as a part of the consideration for such purchase and transfer, purchaser has agreed to assume and pay outstanding debts and liabilities of old corporation, such transaction constitutes liability of the new company to pay such indebtedness and original obligation, which is not required to be in writing under the statute of frauds.

        A shareholder of a corporation who, upon dissolution of the corporation, took assets of the corporation along with obligations of the corporation, and who subsequently told a creditor of the corporation that he would pay the original corporate account, became obligated to pay that account as an original obligation under this section.

        Where the shareholders of a corporation had mutually agreed to pay attorney’s fees, such agreement was made separately and remotely from earlier written promises to guarantee the obligations of the corporation, and the defense of the lawsuits in question was for the benefit of the shareholders in their personal capacities, the oral agreement that obligated each shareholder to pay one-third of the attorney’s fees incurred for the defense of lawsuits against the corporation was an original one under this section, rather than a collateral agreement within the terms of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c05s9-505" target="_blank">§ 9-505</a></cite>(2). Therefore, the statute of frauds did not bar plaintiff shareholder’s claim for reimbursement of money expended for attorney’s fees. Beaupre v. Kingen, 109 Idaho 610, 710 P.2d 520 (1985).

        Acknowledgment of Services.

       <p>
        A written acknowledgment of broker’s services and promise to pay therefor, being unrelated to the oral promise to pay for such services when yet to be performed, was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds or this section, such written instrument being presumptive evidence of a valid consideration and the burden would rest on appellants to avoid such instrument. Homefinders v. Lawrence, 80 Idaho 543, 335 P.2d 893 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirements of this section are not satisfied by an acknowledgment in a contract of sale that the sellers employed the real estate agent and would pay any fee to which he might be entitled and hold the buyers harmless from any liability therefor. Robertson v. Hansen, 89 Idaho 107, 403 P.2d 585 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        A real estate broker’s contract of employment was not invalid because of gross errors in the description of the real estate to be sold where both the owner and the broker were in agreement as to the real estate to be sold, the farm was well known in the neighborhood, and the acreage and location as to county and section numbers were readily available. Central Idaho Agency, Inc. v. Turner, 92 Idaho 306, 442 P.2d 442 (1968).
    Real estate broker was entitled to a commission on the ground that her prior services provided sufficient consideration, even though there was no prior agreement for payment of a commission, where ranch owner knew that commission clause in sales contract stated that payment was for services rendered and plaintiff had procured a party willing to buy the ranch at certain terms and had fulfilled all obligations. Isaguirre v. Echevarria, 96 Idaho 641, 534 P.2d 471 (1975).

        No recovery can be had by broker on oral contract in action on quantum meruit; neither can he recover his expenses incurred in effecting sale in absence of contract to pay therefor. Weatherhead v. Cooney, 32 Idaho 127, 180 P. 760 (1919); Brace v. Johnson, 45 Idaho 327, 262 P. 148 (1927).

        This section does not apply to contract between two brokers, one of whom is employed to assist in sale. Phy v. Selby, 35 Idaho 409, 207 P. 1077 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Oral agreement, under which defendant was to pay plaintiff excess of sale price over certain fixed sum if plaintiff should procure purchaser upon defendant’s acquiring title through sheriff’s deed, was within this section. Brace v. Johnson, 45 Idaho 327, 262 P. 148 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        No commission is collectible unless the real estate broker is authorized in writing to find a purchaser. Stone v. Bradshaw, 64 Idaho 152, 128 P.2d 844 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        A brokerage contract requires the signature of both the broker and the party seeking to obtain a purchaser and it is not a unilateral agreement which the broker may accept by full performance. C. Forsman Real Estate Co. v. Hatch, 97 Idaho 511, 547 P.2d 1116 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a partnership has made a real estate brokerage contract with one broker which authorizes him to “secure the cooperation” of other such brokers, the fact that the other brokers were not parties to the contract did not preclude their sharing in any brokerage fees recovered when they secured a buyer who was ready, willing, and able to perform. Marshall Bros. v. Geisler, 99 Idaho 734, 588 P.2d 933 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A real estate broker’s agreement to find a buyer for property was valid and enforceable where the parties’ agreement was in writing, the property was adequately described, the amount of the commission and terms of the listing were specified, and the agreement was signed by two of the co-owners with representations made to the broker by the signing co-owners that the contemplated transaction would be approved by the third co-owner, even though proposed sale failed because of third co-owner’s refusal to sell her share of property. Rexburg Realty, Inc. v. Compton, 101 Idaho 466, 616 P.2d 245 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a broker’s employment contract or listing agreement meeting the requirements of this section, a broker in Idaho may recover a commission only in exceptional circumstances. Century 21 Quality Properties, Inc. v. Chandler, 103 Idaho 193, 646 P.2d 435 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fundamental purpose of this section is not served if the writing furnished by the broker and relied upon by him for his commission tends to create rather than dispel disputes. Century 21 Quality Properties, Inc. v. Chandler, 103 Idaho 193, 646 P.2d 435 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Broker was not entitled to a commission under a purchase agreement between a business owner and the purchaser of the business’s assets because no agent of the broker signed the agreement; thus, the statute of frauds was not satisfied. Commercial Ventures v. Lea Family Trust, 145 Idaho 208, 177 P.3d 955 (2008).

        A contract dispute between a pension services company and a home builder, who developed a subdivision with a loan of funds from the pension company, related to the repayment terms of the loan and not to the sale of property; thus, the provisions of this section were not applicable.

        Where an “earnest money” form agreement did no more than provide that a brokerage commission would be paid if a particular sale was completed by a certain date, but the sale was delayed without any fraudulent attempt by the owners or the purchasers, the brokerage house was not entitled to its commission where the sale occurred after that date. Century 21 Quality Properties, Inc. v. Chandler, 103 Idaho 193, 646 P.2d 435 (Ct. App. 1982).

       <p>
        A co-owner of property who has expressly or impliedly represented to a broker that he can convey the property to be sold cannot escape personal liability under a brokerage commission contract because it was not signed by the other co-owners and, accordingly, where a landowner signed a brokerage commission contract, but such contract was not signed by his wife or the family corporation, the co-owners of the property in question, the landowner could not escape liability on the contract.

Rather, for purposes of a real estate brokerage agreement, a property description is sufficient where it is shown that there is no misunderstanding between the property owner and the broker as to the property to be offered for sale. In addition, parol evidence may be used to identify the property that is the subject of the agreement, provided it does not vary, add to, or subtract from the agreement the parties intended to make.

        Duty devolves on proponent of holographic will to explain cancellations on face and reverse side thereof, or at least to show that original instrument had not been altered since coming into her hands. In re Fisher’s Estate, 47 Idaho 668, 279 P. 291 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        A proponent showing that she took a holographic will, sealed when she first saw it, from the testator’s private safe and delivered it, still sealed, to her attorney with instructions to deliver it to the probate judge, who opened it, may invoke the presumption that the testator and none other was responsible for cancellation on the face and reverse side of said will. In re Fisher’s Estate, 47 Idaho 668, 279 P. 291 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that the proponent had access for some considerable time to the repository in which a will was found is not sufficient to destroy the presumption that a cancellation therein was made by the testator, in view of the proponent’s sworn testimony that she never saw the will itself until the probate judge opened an envelope containing it. In re Fisher’s Estate, 47 Idaho 668, 279 P. 291 (1929).

        The party presenting a written instrument in evidence which, upon its face, shows that it has been altered is required to explain such alteration or at least to show that such instrument has not been altered since it came into his hands. The party who made or executed the instrument may have made or assented to the alteration before its execution and, yet, holder be unable to prove that fact. Therefore, the exigency of the statute is complied with when the party presenting the instrument shows that there has been no alteration since it came into his hands. Mulkey v.

    <p>
     During the last thirty years the use of mediation has expanded beyond its century-long home in collective bargaining to become an integral and growing part of the processes of dispute resolution in the courts, public agencies, community dispute resolution programs, and the commercial and business communities, as well as among private parties engaged in conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
     Public policy strongly supports this development. Mediation fosters the early resolution of disputes. The mediator assists the parties in negotiating a settlement that is specifically tailored to their needs and interests. The parties’ participation in the process and control over the result contributes to greater satisfaction on their part.

    <i>
     A “Party Satisfaction” Perspective on a Comprehensive Mediation Statute
    </i>
    , 13 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 885 (1998). Increased use of mediation also diminishes the unnecessary expenditure of personal and institutional resources for conflict resolution, and promotes a more civil society. For this reason, hundreds of state statutes establish mediation programs in a wide variety of contexts and encourage their use.

     These laws play a limited but important role in encouraging the effective use of mediation and maintaining its integrity, as well as the appropriate relationship of mediation with the justice system. In particular, the law has the unique capacity to assure that the reasonable expectations of participants regarding the confidentiality of the mediation process are met, rather than frustrated. For this reason, a central thrust of the Act is to provide a privilege that assures confidentiality in legal proceedings (
    see
    Sections 4-6 [§§ 9-804 to 9-806]). Because the privilege makes it more difficult to offer evidence to challenge the settlement agreement, the Drafters viewed the issue of confidentiality as tied to provisions that will help increase the likelihood that the mediation process will be fair. Fairness is enhanced if it will be conducted with integrity and the parties’ knowing consent will be preserved. See Joseph B. Stulberg,

    </i>
    , 6 Harv. Neg. L. Rev. 1 (2001). The Act protects integrity and knowing consent through provisions that provide exceptions to the privilege (Section 6 [§ 9-806]), limit disclosures by the mediator to judges and others who may rule on the case (Section 7 [§ 9-807]), require mediators to disclose conflicts of interest (Section 9 [§ 9-809), and assure that parties may bring a lawyer or other support person to the mediation session (Section 10 [§ 9-810]). In some limited ways, the law can also encourage the use of mediation as part of the policy to promote the private resolution of disputes through informed self-determination.

    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, it is important to avoid laws that diminish the creative and diverse use of mediation. The Act promotes the autonomy of the parties by leaving to them those matters that can be set by agreement and need not be set inflexibly by statute. In addition, some provisions in the Act may be varied by party agreement, as specified in the comments to the sections. This may be viewed as a core Act which can be amended with type specific provisions not in conflict with the Uniform Mediation Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     The provisions in this Act reflect the intent of the Drafters to further these public policies. The Drafters intend for the Act to be applied and construed in a way to promote uniformity, as stated in Section, and also in such manner as to:
    </p>
    <p>
     • promote candor of parties through confidentiality of the mediation process, subject only to the need for disclosure to accommodate specific and compelling societal interests (
    see
    part 1, below);
    </p>
    <p>
     • encourage the policy of fostering prompt, economical, and amicable resolution of disputes in accordance with principles of integrity of the mediation process, active party involvement, and informed self-determination by the parties (
    see
    part 2, below); and
    </p>
    <p>
     • advance the policy that the decision-making authority in the mediation process rests with the parties (
    see
    part 2, below).
    Although the Conference does not recommend “purpose” clauses, States that permit these clauses may consider adapting these principles to serve that function. Each is discussed in turn.

     Candor during mediation is encouraged by maintaining the parties’ and mediators’ expectations regarding confidentiality of mediation communications.
    See
    Sections 4-6 [§§ 9-804 to 9-806]. Virtually all state legislatures have recognized the necessity of protecting mediation confidentiality to encourage the effective use of mediation to resolve disputes. Indeed, state legislatures have enacted more than 250 mediation privilege statutes.

     The Drafters recognize that mediators typically promote a candid and informal exchange regarding events in the past, as well as the parties’ perceptions of and attitudes toward these events, and that mediators encourage parties to think constructively and creatively about ways in which their differences might be resolved. This frank exchange can be achieved only if the participants know that what is said in the mediation will not be used to their detriment through later court proceedings and other adjudicatory processes.

    , Section 2/1-2.3 (2d ed. 1999). This rationale has sometimes been extended to mediators to encourage mediators to be candid with the parties by allowing the mediator to block evidence of the mediator’s notes and other statements by the mediator.

    Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Section 2317.023 (1996).

    <p>
     Similarly, public confidence in and the voluntary use of mediation can be expected to expand if people have confidence that the mediator will not take sides or disclose their statements, particularly in the context of other investigations or judicial processes. The public confidence rationale has been extended to permit the mediator to object to testifying, so that the mediator will not be viewed as biased in future mediation sessions that involve comparable parties.
    See, e.g., NLRB v. Macaluso,
    618 F.2d 51 (9th Cir. 1980) (public interest in maintaining the perceived and actual impartiality of mediators outweighs the benefits derivable from a given mediator’s testimony). To maintain public confidence in the fairness of mediation, a number of States prohibit a mediator from disclosing mediation communications to a judge or other officials in a position to affect the decision in a case. Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, Section 712(c) (1998) (employment discrimination); Fla. Stat. Ann. Section 760.34(1) (1997) (housing discrimination); Ga. Code Ann.

Code Section 703.5 (1994). This justification also is reflected in standards against the use of a threat of disclosure or recommendation to pressure the parties to accept a particular settlement.

    <p>
     A statute is required only to assure that aspect of confidentiality that relates to evidence compelled in a judicial and other legal proceeding. The parties can rely on the mediator’s assurance of confidentiality in terms of mediator disclosures outside the proceedings, as the mediator would be liable for a breach of such an assurance.
    See, e.g., Cohen v. Cowles Media Co
    , 501 U.S. 663 (1991) (First Amendment does not bar recovery against a newspaper’s breach of promise of confidentiality);
     Horne v. Patton
     , 291 Ala. 701, 287 So.2d 824 (1973) (physician disclosure may be invasion of privacy, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract). Also, the parties can expect enforcement of their agreement to keep things confidential through contract damages and sometimes specific enforcement. The courts have also enforced court orders or rules regarding nondisclosure through orders striking pleadings and fining lawyers.
     See
     Section 8;
     see also Parazino v. Barnett Bank of South Florida
     , 690 So.2d 725 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997);
     Bernard v. Galen Group, Inc.
     , 901 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Promises, contracts, and court rules or orders are unavailing, however, with respect to discovery, trial, and otherwise compelled or subpoenaed evidence. Assurance with respect to this aspect of confidentiality has rarely been accorded by common law. Thus, the major contribution of the Act is to provide a privilege in legal proceedings, where it would otherwise either not be available or would not be available in a uniform way across the States.
    </p>
    <p>
     As with other privileges, the mediation privilege must have limits, and nearly all existing state mediation statutes provide them. Definitions and exceptions primarily are necessary to give appropriate weight to other valid justice system values, in addition to those already discussed in this Section. They often apply to situations that arise only rarely, but might produce grave injustice in that unusual case if not excepted from the privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this regard, the Drafters recognize that the credibility and integrity of the mediation process is almost always dependent upon the neutrality and the impartiality of the mediator. The provisions of this Act are not intended to provide the parties with an unwarranted means to bring mediators into the discovery or trial process to testify about matters that occurred during a court ordered or agreed mediation. There are of course exceptions and they are specifically provided for in Section 5(a)(1) [§ 9-805(1)(a)], (express waiver by the mediator) or pursuant to Section 6’s narrow exceptions such as 6(b)(1) [§ 9-806(2)(a)], (felony). Contrary use of the provisions of this Act to involve mediators in the discovery or trial process would have a destructive effect on the mediation process and would not be in keeping with the intent and purpose of the Act.

     2. Encouraging resolution in accordance with other principles
    </h5>
    <p>
     Mediation is a consensual process in which the disputing parties decide the resolution of their dispute themselves with the help of a mediator, rather than having a ruling imposed upon them. The parties’ participation in mediation, often accompanied by counsel, allows them to reach results that are tailored to their interests and needs, and leads to their greater satisfaction in the process and results. Moreover, disputing parties often reach settlement earlier through mediation, because of the expression of emotions and exchanges of information that occur as part of the mediation process.
    </p>
    <p>
     Society at large benefits as well when conflicts are resolved earlier and with greater participant satisfaction. Earlier settlements can reduce the disruption that a dispute can cause in the lives of others affected by the dispute, such as the children of a divorcing couple or the customers, clients and employees of businesses engaged in conflict.
    See
    generally, Jeffrey Rubin, Dean Pruitt and Sung Hee Kim, Social Conflict: Escalation, Stalemate and Settlement 68-116 (2d ed. 1994) (discussing reasons for, and manner and consequences of conflict escalation). When settlement is reached earlier, personal and societal resources dedicated to resolving disputes can be invested in more productive ways. The public justice system gains when those using it feel satisfied with the resolution of their disputes because of their positive experience in a court-related mediation. Finally, mediation can also produce important ancillary effects by promoting an approach to the resolution of conflict that is direct and focused on the interests of those involved in the conflict, thereby fostering a more civil society and a richer discussion of issues basic to policy.

     The primary guarantees of fairness within mediation are the integrity of the process and informed self-determination. Self-determination also contributes to party satisfaction. Consensual dispute resolution allows parties to tailor not only the result but also the process to their needs, with minimal intervention by the State. For example, parties can agree with the mediator on the general approach to mediation, including whether the mediator will be evaluative or facilitative. This party agreement is a flexible means to deal with expectations regarding the desired style of mediation, and so increases party empowerment. Indeed, some scholars have theorized that individual empowerment is a central benefit of mediation.

    , Robert A. Baruch Bush & Joseph P. Folger,
     The Promise of Mediation
     (1994).

    <p>
     Self-determination is encouraged by provisions that limit the potential for coercion of the parties to accept settlements,

    <i>

     3. Importance of uniformity.
    </h5>
    <p>
     This Act is designed to simplify a complex area of the law. Currently, legal rules affecting mediation can be found in more than 2500 statutes. Many of these statutes can be replaced by the Act, which applies a generic approach to topics that are covered in varying ways by a number of specific statutes currently scattered within substantive provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Existing statutory provisions frequently vary not only within a State but also by State in several different and meaningful respects. The privilege provides an important example. Virtually all States have adopted some form of privilege, reflecting a strong public policy favoring confidentiality in mediation. However, this policy is effected through more than 250 different state statutes. Common differences among these statutes include the definition of mediation, subject matter of the dispute, scope of protection, exceptions, and the context of the mediation that comes within the statute (such as whether the mediation takes place in a court or community program or a private setting).
    </p>
    <p>
     Uniformity of the law helps bring order and understanding across state lines, and encourages effective use of mediation in a number of ways. First, uniformity is a necessary predicate to predictability if there is any potential that a statement made in mediation in one State may be sought in litigation or other legal processes in another State. For this reason, the UMA will benefit those States with clearly established law or traditions, such as Texas, California, and Florida, ensuring that the privilege for mediation communications made within those States is respected in other States in which those mediation communications may be sought. The law of privilege does not fit neatly into a category of either substance or procedure, making it difficult to predict what law will apply.
    See, e.g., U.S. v. Gullo
    , 672 F. Supp. 99 (W.D.N.Y. 1987) (holding that New York mediation-arbitration privilege applies in federal court grand jury proceeding);
     Royal Caribbean Corp. v. Modesto
     , 614 So.2d 517 (Fla. App. 1992) (holding that Florida mediation privilege law applies in federal Jones Act claim brought in Florida court). Moreover, parties to a mediation cannot always know where the later litigation or administrative process may occur. Without uniformity, there can be no firm assurance in any State that a mediation is privileged. Ellen E. Deason,
     <i>
      The Quest for Uniformity in Mediation Confidentiality: Foolish Consistency or Crucial Predictability?
     </i>
     , 85 Marquette L. Rev . 79 (2001).
    </p>
    <p>
     A second benefit of uniformity relates to cross-jurisdictional mediation. Mediation sessions are increasingly conducted by conference calls between mediators and parties in different States and even over the Internet. Because it is unclear which State’s laws apply, the parties cannot be assured of the reach of their home state’s confidentiality protections.
    </p>
    <p>
     A third benefit of uniformity is that a party trying to decide whether to sign an agreement to mediate may not know where the mediation will occur and therefore whether the law will provide a privilege or the right to bring counsel or support person. Uniformity will add certainty on these issues, and thus allows for more informed party self-determination.
    Finally, uniformity contributes to simplicity. Mediators and parties who do not have meaningful familiarity with the law or legal research currently face a more formidable task in understanding multiple confidentiality statutes that vary by and within relevant States than they would in understanding a Uniform Act. Mediators and parties often travel to different States for the mediation sessions. If they do not understand these legal protections, participants may react in a guarded way, thus reducing the candor that these provisions are designed to promote, or they may unnecessarily expend resources to have the legal research conducted.

     First, States in the past thirty years have been able to engage in considerable experimentation in terms of statutory approaches to mediation, just as the mediation field itself has experimented with different approaches and styles of mediation. Over time clear trends have emerged, and scholars and practitioners have a reasonable sense as to which types of legal standards are helpful, and which kinds are disruptive. The Drafters have studied this experimentation, enabling state legislators to enact the Act with the confidence that can only come from learned experience.

     Second, as the use of mediation becomes more common and better understood by policymakers, States are increasingly recognizing the benefits of a unified statutory environment for privilege that cuts across all applications. This modern trend is seen in about half of the States that have adopted statutes of general application, and these broad statutes provide guidance on effective approaches to a more general privilege.

     The Mediation Act results from an historic collaboration. The Uniform Law Commission Drafting Committee, chaired by Judge Michael B. Getty, was joined in the drafting of this Act by a Drafting Committee sponsored by the American Bar Association, working through its Section of Dispute Resolution, which was co-chaired by former American Bar Association President Roberta Cooper Ramo (Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris & Sisk, P.A.) and Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer of the Supreme Court of Ohio. The leadership of both organizations had recognized that the time was ripe for a uniform law on mediation. While both Drafting Committees were independent, they worked side by side, sharing resources and expertise in a collaboration that augmented the work of both Drafting Committees by broadening the diversity of their perspectives. See Michael B. Getty, Thomas J. Moyer & Roberta Cooper Ramo,
    Preface to Symposium on Drafting a Uniform/Model Mediation Act
    , 13 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 787 (1998). For instance, the Drafting Committees represented various contexts in which mediation is used: private mediation, court-related mediation, community mediation, and corporate mediation. Similarly, they also embraced a spectrum of viewpoints about the goals of mediation — efficiency for the parties and the courts, the enhancement of the possibility of fundamental reconciliation of the parties, and the enrichment of society through the use of less adversarial means of resolving disputes. They also included a range of viewpoints about how mediation is to be conducted, including, for example, strong proponents of both the evaluative and facilitative models of mediation, as well as supporters and opponents of mandatory mediation.
    Finally, with the assistance of a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, both Drafting Committees had substantial academic support for their work by many of mediation’s most distinguished scholars, who volunteered their time and energies out of their belief in the utility and timeliness of a uniform mediation law. These included members of the faculties of Harvard Law School, the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law, the Ohio State University College of Law, and Bowdoin College, including Professors Frank E.A. Sander (Harvard Law School); Chris Guthrie, John Lande, James Levin, Richard C. Reuben, Leonard L. Riskin, Jean R. Sternlight (University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law); James Brudney, Sarah R. Cole, L. Camille H/Aebert, Nancy H. Rogers, Joseph B. Stulberg, Laura Williams, and Charles Wilson (Ohio State University College of Law); Jeanne Clement (Ohio State University College of Nursing); and Craig A. McEwen (Bowdoin College). The Hewlett support also made it possible for the Drafting Committees to bring noted scholars and practitioners from throughout the nation to advise the Committees on particular issues. These are too numerous to mention but the Committees especially thank those who came to meetings at the advisory group’s request, including Peter Adler, Christine Carlson, Jack Hanna, Eileen Pruett, and Professors Ellen Deason, Alan Kirtley, Kimberlee K. Kovach, Thomas J. Stipanowich, and Nancy Welsh.

     Their scholarly work for the project examined the current legal structure and effectiveness of existing mediation legislation, questions of quality and fairness in mediation, as well as the political environment in which uniform or model legislation operates.

     Finally, observers from a vast array of mediation professional and provider organizations also provided extensive suggestions to the Drafting Committees, including: the Association for Conflict Resolution (formerly the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution, Academy of Family Mediators and CRE/Net), National Council of Dispute Resolution Organizations, American Arbitration Association, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS), CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution, International Academy of Mediators, National Association for Community Mediation, and the California Dispute Resolution Council. Other official observers to the Drafting Committees included: the American Bar Association Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice, American Bar Association Section of Litigation, American Bar Association Senior Lawyers Division, American Bar Association Section of Torts and Insurance Practice, American Trial Lawyers Association, Equal Employment Advisory Council, National Association of District Attorneys, and the Society of Professional Journalists.

     6. Drafting philosophy.
    </h5>
    <p>
     Mediation often involves both parties and mediators from a variety of professions and backgrounds, many of who are not attorneys or represented by counsel. With this in mind, the Drafters sought to make the provisions accessible and understandable to readers from a variety of backgrounds, sometimes keeping the Act shorter by leaving some discretion in the courts to apply the provisions in accordance with the general purposes of the Act, delineated and expanded upon in Section 1 of this Prefatory Note. These policies include fostering prompt, economical, and amicable resolution, integrity in the process, self-determination by parties, candor in negotiations, societal needs for information, and uniformity of law.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Drafters sought to avoid including in the Act those types of provisions that should vary by type of program or legal context and that were therefore more appropriately left to program-specific statutes or rules. Mediator qualifications, for example, are not prescribed by this Act. The Drafters also recognized that some general standards are often better applied through those who administer ethical standards or local rules, where an advisory opinion might be sought to guide persons faced with immediate uncertainty. Where individual choice or notice was important to allow for self-determination or avoid a trap for the unwary, such as for nondisclosure by the parties outside the context of proceedings, the Drafters left the matter largely to local rule or contract among the participants. As the result, the Act largely governs those narrow circumstances in which the mediation process comes into contact with formal legal processes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the Drafters operated with respect for local customs and practices by using the Act to establish a floor rather than a ceiling for some protections. It is not the intent of the Act to preempt state and local court rules that are consistent with the Act, such as those well-established rules in Florida.
    See
    , for example, Fla. R. Civ. P. Rule 1.720;
     see also
     Sections 12 and 15.
    </p>
    <p>
     Consistent with existing approaches in law, and to avoid unnecessary disruption, the Act adopts the structure used by the overwhelming majority of these general application States: the evidentiary privilege. However, many state and local laws do not conflict with the Act and would not be preempted by it. For example, statutes and court rules providing standards for mediators, setting limits of compulsory participation in mediation, and providing mediator qualifications would remain in force.
    </p>
    <p>
     The matter may be less clear if the existing provisions relate to the mediation privilege. Legislative notes provide guidance on some key issues. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the simplicity and clarity sought by the Act, it will be important in each State to review existing privilege statutes and specify in Section 15 which will be repealed and which will remain in force.

     PREFATORY NOTE
    </h5>
    <p>
     As currently approved, the Uniform Mediation Act (UMA) applies to both domestic and international mediation. The purpose of this Amendment is to facilitate state adoption of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation (set forth in Appendix A) that was adopted on November 19, 2002. Adoption of the amendment will encourage the use of mediation of commercial disputes among parties from different nations while maintaining the strong protections of the Uniform Mediation Act regarding the use of mediation communications in legal proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is broad international agreement that it is important to have a similar legal approach internationally for the mediation of international commercial disputes, so that the international parties will know the applicable law and feel comfortable using mediation. With this increased use of mediation, the parties will resolve more of their disputes short of arbitration and litigation. The stated purpose of the UNCITRAL Model Law is to “support the increased use of conciliation” for international commercial disputes, according to the Draft Guide issued by the UNCITRAL Secretariat. Draft Guide to Enactment and Use of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation (November 14, 2002) (“UNCITRAL Draft Guide”). The Draft Guide notes that parties in international commercial conciliation can agree to incorporate by reference existing conventions, such as the UNCITRAL Conciliation Rules, but often fail to make the reference. The UNCITRAL Draft Guide states, “The conciliation process might thus benefit from the establishment of non-mandatory legislative provisions that would apply when the parties mutually desired to conciliate but had not agreed on a set of conciliation rules. Moreover in countries where agreements as to the admissibility of certain kinds of evidence were of uncertain effect, uniform legislation might provide a useful clarification. In addition it was pointed out with respect to certain issues, such as facilitating enforcement of settlement agreements resulting from conciliations, that the level of predictability and certainty required to foster conciliation could only be achieved through legislation.” UNCITRAL Draft Guide 4-5.
    </p>
    <p>
     International consensus on the benefits on enacting the Model Law is strong, and the U.S. State Department has joined the consensus. UNCITRAL adopted the Model Law on June 28, 2002, and it was endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on November 19, 2002. The negotiations leading to the Model Law draft represented a major international effort to harmonize competing legal approaches in order to adopt a common default law for international conciliation. Representatives of 90 countries participated in the drafting of the UNCITRAL Model Law over a two-year period. In addition, 12 intergovernmental organizations and 22 international non-governmental organizations took part in the discussions. The U.S. Department of State represented the United States in the drafting process. The U.S. delegation included advisors from NCCUSL, the American Bar Association, the American Arbitration Association, and the Maritime Law Association. Adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law by U.S. States would help to achieve the desired international uniformity in a default law for international conciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
     There also are strong reasons not to re-draft the UNCITRAL Model Law in substantial ways for enactment by the States. International lawyers may be hesitant to conciliate if they must retain domestic counsel to determine the effects of any changes in the U.S. draft. The UNCITRAL Model Law Draft Guide notes, “In order to achieve a satisfactory degree of harmonization and certainty, States should consider making as few changes as possible in incorporating the Model Law into their legal system, but, if changes are made, they should remain within the basic principles of the Model Law. A significant reason for adhering as much as possible to the uniform text is to make the national law as transparent and familiar as possible for foreign parties, advisers and conciliators who participate in conciliations in the enacting state.” UNCITRAL Draft Guide 5.
    This Amendment incorporates the existing version (Appendix A) of the UNCITRAL Model Law by reference in order to avoid the substantial re-drafting that would be necessary to comport with U.S. drafting conventions. The Legislative Note references important notes on interpretation from the UNCITRAL Secretariat, the Draft Guide to Enactment and Use of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation (November 14, 2002).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Amendment also makes clear that the protection to mediation communications should be as strong for international commercial mediation as it is for domestic mediation of all types under the Uniform Mediation Act. It also makes explicit how the parties can waive those protections.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Amendment was drafted at two sessions that included broad observer participation, including representatives of the Association of Conflict Resolution, the U.S. State Department, and the American Bar Association. Professors Ellen Deason and Jim Brudney of the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law provided able counsel and assistance in the drafting process.

        The emphasis on negotiation in this definition is intended to exclude adjudicative processes, such as arbitration and fact-finding, as well as counseling. It was not intended to distinguish among styles or approaches to mediation. An earlier draft used the word “conducted,” but the Drafting Committees preferred the word “assistance” to emphasize that, in contrast to an arbitration, a mediator has no authority to issue a decision. The use of the word “facilitation” is not intended to express a preference with regard to approaches of mediation. The Drafters recognize approaches to mediation will vary widely. 2. Section 2(2). “Mediation Communication.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Mediation communications are statements that are made orally, through conduct, or in writing or other recorded activity. This definition is aimed primarily at the privilege provisions of Sections 4-6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806]. It is similar to the general rule, as reflected in Uniform Rule of Evidence 801, which defines a “statement” as “an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of an individual who intends it as an assertion.” Most generic mediation privileges cover communications but do not cover conduct that is not intended as an assertion.

By contrast, nonverbal conduct such as nodding in response to a question would be a “communication” because it is meant as an assertion; however nonverbal conduct such as smoking a cigarette during the mediation session typically would not be a “communication” because it was not meant by the actor as an assertion.
       </p>
       <p>
        A mediator’s mental impressions and observations about the mediation present a more complicated question, with important practical implications.
    See Olam v. Congress Mortgage Co.
    , 68 F. Supp. 2d 1110 (N.D. Cal. 1999). As discussed below, the mediation privilege is modeled after, and draws heavily upon, the attorney-client privilege, a strong privilege that is supported by well-developed case law. Courts are to be expected to look to that well developed body of law in construing this Act. In this regard, mental impressions that are based even in part on mediation communications would generally be protected by privilege.
       </p>
       <p>
        More specifically, communications include both statements and conduct meant to inform, because the purpose of the privilege is to promote candid mediation communications.
    U.S. v. Robinson
    , 121 F.3d 911, 975 (5th Cir. 1997). By analogy to the attorney-client privilege, silence in response to a question may be a communication, if it is meant to inform.
        U.S. v. White
        , 950 F.2d 426, 430 n.2 (7th Cir. 1991). Further, conduct meant to explain or communicate a fact, such as the re-enactment of an accident, is a communication.
        See
        Weinstein’s Federal Evidence 503.14 (2000). Similarly, a client’s revelation of a hidden scar to an attorney in response to a question is a communication if meant to inform. In contrast, a purely physical phenomenon, such as a tattoo or the color of a suit of clothes, observable by all, is not a communication.
       </p>
       <p>
        If evidence of mental impressions would reveal, even indirectly, mediation communications, then that evidence would be blocked by the privilege.
    Gunther v. U.S.,
    230 F.2d 222, 223-224 (D.C. Cir. 1956). For example, a mediator’s mental impressions of the capacity of a mediation participant to enter into a binding mediated settlement agreement would be privileged if that impression was in part based on the statements that the party made during the mediation, because the testimony might reveal the content or character of the mediation communications upon which the impression is based. In contrast, the mental impression would not be privileged if it was based exclusively on the mediator’s observation of that party wearing heavy clothes and an overcoat on a hot summer day because the choice of clothing was not meant to inform.
    <i>
     Darrow v. Gunn
    </i>
    , 594 F.2d 767, 774 (9th Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no justification for making readily observable conduct privileged, certainly not more privileged than it is under the attorney-client privilege. If the conduct is seen in the mediation room, it can also be observed, even photographed, outside of the mediation room, as well as in other contexts. One of the primary reasons for making mediation communications privileged is to promote candor, and excluding evidence of a readily observable characteristic is not necessary to promote candor.
    In re Walsh
    , 623 F.2d 489, 494 (7th Cir. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision makes clear that conversations to initiate mediation and other non-session communications that are related to a mediation are considered “mediation communications.” Most statutes are silent on the question of whether they cover conversations to initiate mediation. However, candor during these initial conversations is critical to insuring a thoughtful agreement to mediate, and the Act therefore extends confidentiality to these conversations to encourage that candor.
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition in Section 2(2) is narrowly tailored to permit the application of the privilege to protect communications that a party would reasonably believe would be confidential, such as the explanation of the matter to an intake clerk for a community mediation program, and communications between a mediator and a party that occur between formal mediation sessions. These would be communications “
    made for the purposes of
    considering, initiating, continuing, or reconvening a mediation or retaining a mediator.” This language protects the confidentiality of such a communication when doing so advances the underlying policies of the privilege, while at the same time gives the courts the latitude to restrict the application of the privilege in situations where such an application of the privilege would constitute an abuse. For example, an individual trying to hide information from a court might later attempt to characterize a call to an acquaintance about a dispute as an inquiry to the acquaintance about the possibility of mediating the dispute. This definition would permit the court to disallow a communication privilege, and admit testimony from that acquaintance by finding that the communication was not “
        made for the purposes of
        initiating considering, initiating, continuing, or reconvening a mediation or retaining a mediator.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Responding in part to public concerns about the complexity of earlier drafts, the Drafting Committees also elected to leave the question of when a mediation ends to the sound judgment of the courts to determine according to the facts and circumstances presented by individual cases.
    See Bidwell v. Bidwell
    , 173 Or. App. 288 (2001) (ruling that letters between attorneys for the parties that were sent after referral to mediation and related to settlement were mediation communications and therefore privileged under the Oregon statute). In weighing language about when a mediation ends, the Drafting Committees considered other more specific approaches for answering these questions. One approach in particular would have terminated the mediation after a specified period of time if the parties failed to reach an agreement, such as the 10-day period specified in Cal. Evid. Code Section 1125 (1997) (general). However, the Drafting Committees rejected that approach because it felt that such a requirement could be easily circumvented by a routine practice of extending mediation in a form mediation agreement. Indeed, such an extension in a form agreement could result in the coverage of communications unrelated to the dispute for years to come, without furthering the purposes of the privilege.
    Finally, this definition would also include mediation “briefs” and other reports that are prepared by the parties for the mediator. Whether the document is prepared for the mediation is a crucial issue. For example, a tax return brought to a divorce mediation would not be a “mediation communication” because it was not a “statement made as part of the mediation,” even though it may have been used extensively in the mediation. However, a note written on the tax return to clarify a point for other participants would be a mediation communication. Similarly, a memorandum specifically prepared for the mediation by the party or the party’s representative explaining the rationale behind certain positions taken on the tax return would be a “mediation communication.” Documents prepared for the mediation by expert witnesses attending the mediation would also be covered by this definition.

        Several points are worth stressing with regard to the definition of mediator. First, this definition should be read in conjunction with Section 9(c) [§ 9-809(3)], which makes clear that the Act does not require that a mediator have a special qualification by background or profession. Second, this definition should be read in conjunction with the model language in Section 9(a) through (e) [§ 9-809(1) through (5)] on disclosures of conflicts of interest. Finally, the use of the word “conducts” is intended to be value neutral, and should not be read to express a preference for the manner by which mediations are conducted.

       </p>
       <p>
        This definition would cover experts, friends, support persons, potential parties, and others who participate in the mediation. The definition is pertinent to the privilege accorded nonparty participants in Section 4(b)(3) [§ 9-804(2)(c)], and to the ability of parties to bring attorneys or support persons in Section 10 [§ 9-810]. In the event that an attorney is deemed to be a nonparty participant, that attorney would be constricted in exercising that right by ethical provisions requiring the attorney to act in ways that are consistent with the interests of the client.
    See
    Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3 (Diligence. A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.); and Rule 1.6(a) (Confidentiality of Information. A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).).

        5. Section 2(5). “Mediation Party.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The Act defines “mediation party” to be a person who participates in a mediation and whose agreement is necessary to resolve the dispute. These limitations are designed to prevent someone with only a passing interest in the mediation, such as a neighbor of a person embroiled in a dispute, from attending the mediation and then blocking the use of information or taking advantage of rights meant to be accorded to parties. Such a person would be a non-party participant and would have only a limited privilege.
    See
    Section 4(b)(3) [§ 9-804(2)(c)]. Similarly, counsel for a mediation party would not be a mediation party, because their agreement is not necessary to the resolution of the dispute.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of these structural limitations on the definition of parties, participants who do not meet the definition of “mediation party,” such as a witness or expert on a given issue, do not have the substantial rights under additional sections that are provided to parties. Rather, these non-party participants are granted a more limited privilege under Section 4(b)(3) [§ 9-804(2)(c)]. Parties seeking to apply restrictions on disclosures by such participants — including their attorneys and other representatives — should consider drafting such a confidentiality obligation into a valid and binding agreement that the participant signs as a condition of participation in the mediation.
    A mediation party may participate in the mediation in person, by phone, or electronically. A person, as defined in Section 2(6), may participate through a designated agent. If the party is an entity, it is the entity, rather than a particular agent, that holds the privilege afforded in Sections 4-6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806].

        These Sections adopt standard language approved by the Uniform Law Conference that is intended to conform Uniform Acts with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) and its federal counterpart, Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign) (15 U.S.C 7001, et seq. (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both UETA and E-Sign were written in response to broad recognition of the commercial and other use of electronic technologies for communications and contracting, and the consensus that the choice of medium should not control the enforceability of transactions. These Sections are consistent with both UETA and E-Sign. UETA has been adopted by the Conference and received the approval of the American Bar Association House of Delegates. As of December 2001, it had been enacted in more than 35 states.

        The practical effect of these provisions is to make clear that electronic signatures and documents have the same authority as written ones for purposes of establishing an agreement to mediate under Section 3(a) [§ 9-803(1)], party opt-out of the mediation privilege under Section 3(c) [§ 9-803(3)], and participant waiver of the mediation privilege under Section 5(a) [§ 9-805(1)].

        The Act is broad in its coverage of mediation, a departure from the common state statutes that apply to mediation in particular contexts, such as court-connected mediation or community mediation, or to the mediation of particular types of disputes, such as worker’s compensation or civil rights.
    See, e.g.
    , Neb. Rev. Stat. Section 48-168 (1993) (worker’s compensation); Iowa Code Section 216.15A (1999) (civil rights). Moreover, unlike many mediation privileges, it also applies in some contexts in which the Rules of Evidence are not consistently followed, such as administrative hearings and arbitration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the Act in fact applies is a crucial issue because it determines not only the application of the mediation privilege but also whether the mediator has the obligations regarding the disclosure of conflicts of interest and, if asked, qualifications in Section 9 [§ 9-809]; is prohibited from making disclosures about the mediation to courts, agencies and investigative authorities in Section 7 [§ 9-807]; and must accommodate requirements regarding accompanying individuals in Section 10 [§ 9-810].
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the breadth of the Act’s coverage, it is important to delineate its scope with precision. Section 3(a) [(1)] sets forth three different mechanisms that trigger the Act’s coverage, and will likely cover most mediation situations that commonly arise. Section 3(b) [(2)] on the other hand, carves out a series of narrow and specific exemptions from the Act’s coverage. Finally, Section 3(c) [(3)] provides a vehicle through which parties who would be mediating in a context covered by Section 3(a) [(1)] may “opt out” of the Act’s protections and responsibilities. The central operating principle throughout this Section is that the Act should support, and guide, the parties’ reasonable expectations about whether the mediations in which they are participating are included within the scope of the Act.

       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3(a) [(1)] sets forth three conditions, the satisfaction of any one of which will trigger the application of the Act. This triggering requirement is necessary because the many different forms, contexts, and practices of mediation and other methods of dispute resolution make it sometimes difficult to know with certainty whether one is engaged in a mediation or some other dispute resolution or prevention process that employs mediation and related principles.
    See, e.g.
    , Ellen J. Waxman & Howard Gadlin,
        Ombudsmen: A Buffer Between Institutions, Individuals
        , 4 Disp. Resol. Mag. 21 (Summer 1998) (describing functions of ombuds, which can at times include mediation concepts and skills); Janice Fleischer & Zena Zumeta,

        , 4 Disp. Resol. Mag. 4 (Summer 1998) (comparing post-dispute mediation with pre-dispute facilitation); Lindsay “Peter” White,
        Partnering: Agreeing to Work Together on Problems
        , 4 Disp. Resol. Mag. 18 (Summer 1998) (describing a common collaborative problem solving technique used in the construction industry). This problem is exacerbated by the fact that unlike other professionals — such as doctors, lawyers, and social workers — mediators are not licensed and the process they conduct is informal. If the intent to mediate is not clear, even a casual discussion over a backyard fence might later be deemed to have been a mediation, unfairly surprising those involved and frustrating the reasonable expectations of the parties. The first triggering mechanism, Section 3(a)(1) [(1)(a)], subject to exceptions provided in 3(b) [(2)], covers those situations in which mediation parties are either required to mediate or referred to mediation by governmental institutions or by an arbitrator. Administrative agencies include those public agencies with the authority to prescribe rules and regulations to administer a statute, as well as the authority to adjudicate matters arising under such a statute. They include agricultural departments, child protective services, civil rights commissions and worker’s compensation boards, to name only a few. Through this triggering mechanism, the formal court-referred mediation that many people associate with mediation is clearly covered by the Act.
    Where Section 3(a)(1) [(1)(a)] focuses on publicly referred mediations, the second triggering mechanism, Section 3(a)(2) [(1)(b)], furthers party autonomy by allowing mediation parties and the mediator to trigger the Act by agreeing to mediate in a record that is signed by the parties and by the mediator. A later note by one party that they agreed to mediate would not constitute a record of an agreement to mediate. In addition, the record must demonstrate the expectation of the mediation parties and the mediator that the mediation communications will have a privilege against disclosure.

        Yet significantly, these individuals are not required to use any magic words to obtain the protection of the Act.
    See Haghighi v. Russian-American Broadcasting Co.
    , 577 N.W.2d 927 (Minn. 1998). The lack of a requirement for magic words tracks the intent to be inclusive and to embrace the many different approaches to mediation. Moreover, were magic words required, party and mediator expectations of confidentiality under the Act might be frustrated, since a mediation would only be covered by the Act if the institution remembered to include them in any agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase “privileged against disclosure” clarifies the type of expectations that the record must demonstrate tin order to show an expectation of confidentiality in a subsequent legal setting. Mere generalized expectations of confidentiality in a non-legal setting are not enough to trigger the Act if the case does not fit under Sections 3(a)(1) [(1)(a)] or 3(a)(3) [(1)(c)]. Take for example a dispute in a university between the heads of the Spanish and Latin departments that is mediated or “worked out informally” with the assistance of the head of the French department, at the suggestion of the university provost. Such a mediation would not reasonably carry with it party or mediator expectations that the mediation would be conducted pursuant to an evidentiary privilege, rights of disclosure and accompaniment and the other protections and obligations of the Act. Indeed, some of the parties and the mediator may more reasonably expect that the mediation results, and even the underlying discussions, would be disclosed to the university provost, and perhaps communicated throughout the parties’ respective departments and elsewhere on campus. By contrast, however, if the university has a written policy regarding the mediation of disputes that embraces the Act, and the mediation is specifically conducted pursuant to that policy, and the parties agree to participate in mediation in a record signed by the parties, then the parties would reasonably expect that the Act would apply and conduct themselves accordingly, both in the mediation and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third triggering mechanism, Section 3(a)(3) [(1)(c)], focuses on individuals and organizations that provide mediation services and provides that the Act applies when the mediation is conducted by one who is held out as a mediator. For example, disputing neighbors who mediate with a volunteer at a community mediation center would be covered by the Act, since the center holds itself out as providing mediation services. Similarly, mediations conducted by a private mediator who advertises his or her services as a mediator would also be covered, since the private mediator holds himself or herself out to the public as a mediator. Because the mediator is publicly held out as a mediator, the parties may reasonably expect mediations they conduct to be conducted pursuant to relevant law, specifically the Act. By including those mediations conducted by private mediators who hold themselves out as mediators, the Act tracks similar doctrines regarding other professions. In other contexts, “holding out” has included making a representation in a public manner of being in the business or having another person make that representation.
    See
    18A Am. Jur. 2d Corporations Section 271 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mediations can be conducted by ombuds practitioners.
    See Standards for the Establishment and Operation of Ombuds Offices
    (August 2001). If such a mediation is conducted pursuant to one of these triggering mechanisms, such as a written agreement under Section 3(a)(2) [(1)(b)], it will be protected under the terms of the Act. There is no intent by the Drafters to exclude or include mediations conducted by an ombuds
        a priori
        . The terms of the Act determine applicability, not a mediator’s formal title.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, on the issue of Section 3(a) [(1)] inclusions into the Act, the Drafting Committees discussed whether it should cover the many cultural and religious practices that are similar to mediation and that use a person similar to the mediator, as defined in this Act. On the one hand, many of these cultural and religious practices, like more traditional mediation, streamline and resolve conflicts, while solving problems and restoring relationships. Some examples of these practices are Ho’oponopono, circle ceremonies, family conferencing, and pastoral or marital counseling. These cultural and religious practices bring richness to the quality of life and contribute to traditional mediation. On the other hand, there are instances in which the application of the Act to these practices would be disruptive of the practices and therefore undesirable. On balance, furthering the principle of self-determination, the Drafting Committees decided that those involved should make the choice to be covered by the Act in those instances in which other definitional requirements of Section 2 [§ 9-802] are met by entering into an agreement to mediate reflected by a record or securing a court or agency referral pursuant to Section 3(a)(1) [(1)(a)]. At the same time, these persons could opt out the Act’s coverage by not using this triggering mechanism. This leaves a great deal of leeway, appropriately, with those involved in the practices.

        Collective bargaining disputes are excluded because of the longstanding, solidified, and substantially uniform mediation systems that already are in place in the collective bargaining context.

This exclusion includes the mediation of disputes arising under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, as well as mediations relating to the formation of a collective bargaining agreement. By contrast, the exclusion does not include employment discrimination disputes not arising under the collective bargaining agreement as well as employment disputes arising after the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement. Mediations of disputes in these contexts remain within the protections and responsibilities of the Act.

       <p>
        Difficult issues arise in mediations that are conducted by judges during the course of settlement conferences related to pending litigation, and this Section excludes certain judicially conducted mediations from the Act. Some have the concern that party autonomy in mediation may be constrained either by the direct coercion of a judicial officer who may make a subsequent ruling on the matter, or by the indirect coercive effect that inherently inures from the parties’ knowledge of the ultimate presence of that judge.
    See, e.g.,
    James J. Alfini,
        Risk of Coercion Too Great: Judges Should Not Mediate Cases Assigned to Them For Trial
        , 6 Disp. Resol. Mag. 11 (Fall 1999), and Frank E.A. Sander,
        A Friendly Amendment
        , 6 Disp. Resol. Mag. 11 (Fall 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        This concern is further complicated by the variegated nature of judicial settlement conferences. As a general matter, judicial settlement conferences are typically conducted under court or procedural rules that are similar to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and have come to include a wide variety of functions, from simple case management to a venue for court-ordered mediations.
    See
    Mont. R. Civ. P., Rule 16(a). In situations in which a part of the function of judicial conferences is case management, the parties hardly have an expectation of confidentiality in the proceedings, even though there may be settlement discussions initiated or facilitated by the judge or judicial officer. In fact, such hearings frequently lead to court orders on discovery and issues limitations that are entered into the public record. In such circumstances, the policy rationales supporting the confidentiality privilege and other provisions of the Act are not furthered.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, there are judicially-hosted settlement conferences that for all practical purposes are mediation sessions for which the Act’s policies of promoting full and frank discussions between the parties would be furthered.
    See
    generally Wayne D. Brazil,
        Hosting Settlement Conferences: Effectiveness in the Judicial Role

       </p>
       <p>
        The Act recognizes the tension created by this wide variety of settlement functions by drawing a line with regard to those conferences that are covered by the Act and those that are not covered by the Act. The Act excludes those settlement conferences in which information from the mediation is communicated to a judge with responsibility for the case. This is consistent with the prohibition on mediator reports to courts in Section 7 [§ 9-807]. The term “judge” in Section 3(b)(3) [(2)(c)] includes magistrates, special masters, referees, and any other persons responsible for making rulings or recommendations on the case. However, the Act does not apply to a court mediator, or a mediator who contracts or volunteers to mediate cases for a court because they may not make later rulings on the case. Similarly mediations conducted by judges specifically and exclusively are assigned to mediate cases, so-called “buddy judges,” and retired judges who return to mediate cases do not fall within the Section 3(b)(3) [(2)(c)] exemption because such mediators do not make later rulings on the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local rules are usually not recognized beyond the court’s jurisdiction, and may not provide assurance of confidentiality if the mediation communications are sought in another jurisdiction, and if the jurisdiction does not permit recognize privilege by local rule.

        The Act also exempts mediations between students conducted under the auspices of school programs because the supervisory needs of schools toward students, particularly in peer mediation, may not be consistent with the confidentiality provisions of the Act. For example, school administrators need to be able to respond to, and in a proceeding verify, legitimate threats to student safety or domestic violence that may surface during a mediation between students.
    See
    Memorandum from ABA Section of Dispute Resolution to Uniform Mediation Act Reporters (Nov. 15, 1999) (on file with UMA Drafting Committees).

The Act also exempts programs involving youths at correctional institutions if the mediation parties are all residents of the institution. This is to facilitate and encourage mediation and conflict prevention and resolution techniques among those juveniles who have well-documented and profound needs in those areas. Kristina H. Chung, Kids Behind Bars: The Legality of Incarcerating Juveniles in Adult Jails, 66 Ind. L.J. 999, 1021 (1991). Exempting these programs serves the same policies as are served by the peer mediation exclusion for non-incarcerated youths. The Drafters do not intend to exclude cases where at least one party is not a resident, such as a class action suit against a non-resident in which the parties mediate or attempt to mediate the case.

        7. Section 3(c) [(3)]. Alternative of non-privileged mediation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Section allows the parties to opt for a non-privileged mediation or mediation session by mutual agreement, and furthers the Act’s policy of party self-determination. If the parties so agree, the privilege sections of the Act do not apply, thus fulfilling the parties reasonable expectations regarding the confidentiality of that mediation or session. For example, parties in a sophisticated commercial mediation, who are represented by counsel, may see no need for a privilege to attach to a mediation or session, and may by express written agreement “opt out” of the Act’s privilege provisions. Similarly, parties may also use this option if they wish to rely on, and therefore use in evidence, statements made during the mediation. It is the parties rather than the mediator who make this choice, although a mediator could presumably refuse to mediate a mediation or session that is not covered by this Act. Even if the parties do not agree in advance, the parties, mediator, and all nonparty participants can waive the privilege pursuant to Section 5. In this instance, however, the mediator and other participants can block the waiver in some respects.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the parties want to opt out, they should inform the mediators or nonparty participants of this agreement, because without actual notice, the privileges of the Act still apply to the mediation communications of the persons who have not been so informed until such notice is actually received. Thus, for example, if a nonparty participant has not received notice that the opt-out has been invoked, and speaks during a mediation, that mediation communication is privileged under the Act. If, however, one of the parties or the mediator tells the nonparty participant that the opt-out has been invoked, the privilege no longer attaches to statements made after the actual notice has been provided, even though the earlier statements remain privileged because of the lack of notice.

    Sections 4 through 6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806] set forth the Uniform Mediation Act’s general structure for protecting the confidentiality of mediation communications against disclosure in later legal proceedings. Section 4 [this section] sets forth the evidentiary privilege, which provides that disclosure of mediation communications generally cannot be compelled in designated proceedings or discovery and results in the exclusion of these communications from evidence and from discovery if requested by any party or, for certain communications, by a mediator or nonparty participant as well, unless within an exception delineated in Section 6 [§ 9-806] applies or the privilege is waived under the provisions of Section 5 [§ 9-805]. It further delineates the fora in which the privilege may be asserted. The term “proceeding” is defined in Section 2(7) [§ 9-802(7)]. The provisions of Sections 4-6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806] may not be expanded by the agreement of the parties, but the protections may be waived under Section 5 [§ 9-805] or under Section 3(c) [§ 9-803(3)]. 2.

     Developments in the Law — Privileged Communications
    
    , 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1450 (1985). The Drafters considered several other approaches to mediation confidentiality — including a categorical exclusion for mediation communications, the extension of evidentiary settlement discussion rules to mediation, and mediator incompetency. Upon exhaustive study and consideration, however, each of these mechanisms proved either overbroad in that they failed to fairly account for interests of justice that might occasionally outweigh the importance of mediation confidentiality (categorical exclusion and mediator incompetency), underbroad in that they failed to meet the reasonable needs of the mediation process or the reasonable expectations of the parties in the mediation process (settlement discussions), or under-inclusive in that they failed to provide protection for all of those involved in the mediation process (mediator incompetency).
   
    The Drafters ultimately settled on the use of the privilege structure, the primary means by which communications are protected at law, an approach that is narrowly tailored to satisfy the legitimate interests and expectations of participants in mediation, the mediation process, and the larger system of justice in which it operates. The privilege structure also provides greater certainty in judicial interpretation because of the courts’ familiarity with other privileges, and is consistent with the approach taken by the overwhelming majority of legislatures that have acted to provide broad legal protections for mediation confidentiality. Indeed, of the 25 States that have enacted confidentiality statutes of general application, 21 have plainly used the privilege structure. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 12-2238 (1993); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 16-7-206 (1997); Iowa Code Section 679C.2 (1998); Kan. Stat. Ann. Section 60-452 (1964); La. Rev. St. Ann. Section 9:4112 (1997); Me. R. Evid. Section 408 (1997); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, Section 23C (1985); Mont. Code Ann. Section 26-1-813 (1999); Nev. Rev. Stat. Section 48.109(3) (1993); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Section 2317.023 (1996); Okla. stat. tit. 12, Section 1805 (1983); Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 36.220 (1997); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. Section 5949 (1996) (general); R.I. Gen. Laws Section 9-19-44 (1992); S.D. Codified Laws Section 19-13-32 (1998); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Section 154.053 (c) (1999); Utah Code Ann. Section 30-3-38(4) (2000); Va. Code Ann. Section 8.01-576.10 (1994); Wash. Rev. Code Section 5.60.070 (1993); Wis. Stat. Section 904.085(4)(a) (1997); Wyo. Stat. Section 1-43-103 (1991). At least one other has arguably used the privilege structure:
    See Olam v. Congress Mortgage Co.
    , 68 F. Supp. 2d 1110 (N.D. Cal. 1999) (treating Cal. Evid. Code Section 703.5 (1994) and Cal. Evid. Code Section 1119, 1122 (1997) as a privilege).
   
    That these privilege statutes also tend to be the more recent of mediation confidentiality statutory provisions suggests that privilege may also be seen as the more modern approach taken by state legislatures.
    See, e.g.,
    Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. Section 2317.023 (1996); Fla. Stat. Ann. Section 44.102 (1999); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. Section 5.60.072 (1993);

    The privilege structure carefully balances the needs of the justice system against party and mediator needs for confidentiality. For this reason, legislatures and courts have used the privilege to provide the basis for protection for other forms of professional communications privileges, including attorney-client, doctor-patient, and priest-penitent relationships.

    The privilege applies to a broad array of “mediation communications” including some communications that are not made during the course of a formal mediation session, such as those made for purposes of convening or continuing a mediation.

       </p>

        As with other privileges, a mediation privilege operates to allow a person to refuse to disclose and to prevent another from disclosing particular communications.
    See generally
    Strong,
        supra
        , at Section 72;
        Developments in the Law — Privileged Communications

       </p>
       <p>
        This blocking function is critical to the operation of the privilege. As discussed in more detail below, parties have the greatest blocking power and may block provision of testimony about or other evidence of mediation communications made by anyone in the mediation, including persons other than the mediator and parties. The evidence may be blocked whether the testimony is by another party, a mediator, or any other participant. However, if all parties agree that a party should testify about a party’s mediation communications, no one else may block them from doing so, including a mediator or nonparty participant.
    Mediators may block their own provision of evidence, including their own testimony and evidence provided by anyone else of the mediator’s mediation communications, even if the parties consent. Nonetheless, the parties’ consent is required to admit the mediator’s provision of evidence, as well as evidence provided by another regarding the mediator’s mediation communications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, a nonparty participant may block evidence of that individual’s mediation communication regardless of who provides the evidence and whether the parties or mediator consent. Once again, nonetheless, the nonparty participant may not provide such evidence if the parties do not consent. This is consistent with fixing the limits of the privilege to protect the expectations of those persons whose candor is most important to the success of the mediation process.

        A critical component of the Act’s general rule is its designation of the holder — i.e., the person who is eligible to raise and waive the privilege.
       </p>
       <p>
        This designation brings both clarity and uniformity to the law. Statutory mediation privileges are somewhat unusual among evidentiary privileges in that they often do not specify who may hold and/or waive the privilege, leaving that to judicial interpretation.
    See, e.g.,
    710 Ill. Comp. Stat. Section 20/6 (1987) (community dispute resolution centers); Ind. Code Section 20-7.5-1-13 (1987) (university employee unions); Iowa Code Section 679.12 (1985) (general); Ky.

        Those statutes that designate a holder tend to be split between those that make the parties the only holders of the privilege, and those that also make the mediator a holder.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The mediation privilege of the parties draws upon the purpose, rationale, and traditions of the attorney-client privilege, in that its paramount justification is to encourage candor by the mediation parties, just as encouraging the client’s candor is the central justification for the attorney-client privilege.
    See
    Paul R. Rice,
        Attorney Client Privilege in the United States
        2.1-2.3 (2d ed. 1999).
    The analysis for the parties as holders appears quite different at first examination from traditional communications privileges because mediations involve parties whose interests appear to be adverse. However, the law of attorney-client privilege has considerable experience with situations in which multiple-client interests may conflict, and those experiences support the analogy of the mediation privilege to the attorney-client privilege. For example, the attorney-client privilege has been recognized in the context of a joint defense in which interests of the clients may conflict in part and yet one may prevent later disclosure by another.

        It should be noted that even if the mediator loses the privilege to block or assert a privilege, the parties may still come forward and assert their privilege, thus blocking the mediator who has lost the privilege from providing testimony about the affected mediation.

        Mediators are made holders with respect to their own mediation communications, so that they may participate candidly, and with respect to their own testimony, so that they will not be viewed as biased in future mediations, as discussed further in the Reporter’s Prefatory Note. As noted above in Section 4(a)(2) above and in commentary to Section 9(d) below, even if the mediator loses the privilege to block or assert a privilege, the parties may still come forward and assert their privilege.

       <p>
        In addition, the Act adds a privilege for the nonparty participant, though limited to the communications by that individual in the mediation.
    See
    5 U.S.C. Section 574(a)(1). The purpose is to encourage the candid participation of experts and others who may have information that would facilitate resolution of the case. This would also cover statements prepared by such persons for the mediation and submitted as part of it, such as experts’ reports. Any party who expects to use such an expert report prepared to submit in mediation later in a legal proceeding would have to secure permission of all parties and the expert in order to do so. This is consistent with the treatment of reports prepared for mediation as mediation communications.

       <p>
        As a practical matter, a person who holds a mediation privilege can only assert the privilege if that person knows that evidence of a mediation communication will be sought or offered at a proceeding. This presents no problem in the usual case in which the subsequent proceeding arises because of the failure of the mediation to resolve the dispute because the mediation party would be one of the parties to the proceeding in which the mediation communications are being sought. To guard against the unusual situation in which a party or mediator may wish to assert the privilege, but is unaware of the necessity, the parties and mediator may wish to contract for notification of the possible use of mediation information, as is a practice under the attorney-client privilege for joint defense consultation.
    See

        5. Section 4(c) [(3)]. Otherwise discoverable evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        This provision acknowledges the importance of the availability of relevant evidence to the truth-seeking function of courts and administrative agencies, and makes clear that relevant evidence may not be shielded from discovery or admission at trial merely because it is communicated in a mediation. For purposes of the mediation privilege, it is the communication that is made in a mediation that is protected by the privilege, not the underlying evidence giving rise to the communication. Evidence that is communicated in a mediation is subject to discovery, just as it would be if the mediation had not taken place.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine in the mediation privilege. For example, a party who learns about a witness during a mediation is not precluded by the privilege from subpoenaing that witness. This is a common exemption in mediation privilege statutes, and is also found in Uniform Rule of Evidence 408.

       </p>
       <p>
        Section 5 [this section] provides for waiver of privilege, and for a party, mediator, or nonparty participant to be precluded from asserting the privilege in situations in which mediation communications have been disclosed before the privilege has been asserted. Waiver must be express and either recorded through a writing or electronic record or made orally during specified types of proceedings. These rules further the principle of party autonomy in that mediation participants may generally prefer not to waive their mediation privilege rights. However, there may be situations in which one or more parties may wish to be freed from the burden of privilege, and the waiver provision permits that possibility.
    See, e.g., Olam v. Congress Mortgage Co.
    , 68 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1131-33 (N.D. Cal. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Significantly, these provisions differ from the attorney-client privilege in that the mediation privilege does not permit waiver to be implied by conduct.
    See
    Michael H. Graham,
    <i>
     Handbook of Federal Evidence
    </i>
    Section 511.1 (4th ed. 1996). The rationale for requiring explicit waiver is to safeguard against the possibility of inadvertent waiver, such as through the often salutary practice of parties discussing their dispute and mediation with friends and relatives. In contrast to these settings, there is a sense of formality and awareness of legal rights in all of the proceedings to which the privilege may be waived if the waiver is oral. They generally are conducted on the record, easing the difficulties of establishing what was said.
    Read together with Section 4 [§ 9-804], the waiver operates as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        •  For testimony about mediation communications made by a party, all parties are the holders and therefore all parties must waive the privilege before a party or nonparty participant may testify or provide evidence; if that testimony is to be provided by a mediator, all parties and the mediator must waive the privilege.
       </p>
       <p>
        •  For testimony about mediation communications that are made by the mediator, both the parties and the mediator are holders of the privilege, and therefore both the parties and the mediator must waive the privilege before a party, mediator, or nonparty participant may testify or provide evidence of a mediator’s mediation communications.
       </p>
       <p>
        •  For testimony about mediation communications that are made by a nonparty participant, both the parties and the nonparty participants are holders of the privilege and therefore both the parties and the nonparty participant must waive before a party or nonparty participant may testify; if that testimony is to be offered through the mediator, the mediator must also waive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier drafts included provisions that permitted waiver by conduct, which is common among communications privileges. However, the Drafting Committees deleted those provisions because of concerns that mediators and parties unfamiliar with the statutory environment might waive their privilege rights inadvertently. That created the anomalous situation of permitting the opportunity for one party to blurt out potentially damaging information in the midst of a trial and then use the privilege to block the other party from contesting the truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        To address this anomaly, the Drafters added Section 5(b) [(2)], a preclusion provision to cover situations in which the parties do not expressly waive the privilege but engage in conduct inconsistent with the assertions of the privilege, and that cause prejudice. As under existing interpretations for other communications privileges, waiver through preclusion would not typically constitute a waiver with respect to all mediation communications, only those related in subject matter.
    See generally
    Unif. R. Evid. R. 510 and 511 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Critically, the preclusion provision applies only if the disclosure prejudices another in a proceeding. It is not intended to encompass the casual recounting of the mediation session to a neighbor that is not admissible in court, but would include disclosure that would, absent the exception, allow one party to take unfair advantage of the privilege. For example, if one party’s attorney states in court that the other party admitted destroying evidence during mediation, that party should not be able to block the use of testimony to refute that statement later in that proceeding. Such advantage-taking or opportunism would be inconsistent with the policy rationales that support continued recognition of the privilege, while the casual conversation would not. Thus, if Andy and Betty were the parties in a mediation, and Andy affirmatively stated in court that Betty admitted destroying evidence during the mediation, Andy is precluded from asserting that A did not waive the privilege. If Betty decides to waive as well, evidence of Andy’s and Betty’s statements during mediation may be admitted.

        cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances), and the rule of completeness in Rule 106 of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, which states that if one party introduces part of a record, an adverse party may introduce other parts when to do otherwise would be unfair.
    Finally, it is worth noting that in arbitration, which is sometimes conducted without an ongoing record, it will be important for waiving parties to ask the arbitrator to note the waiver. Any individual who wants notice that another has received a subpoena for mediation communications or has waived the privilege can provide for notification as a clause in the agreement to mediate or the mediated agreement.

        2. Section 5(c) [(3)]. Preclusion for use of mediation to plan or commit crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        This preclusion reflects a common practice in the States of exempting from confidentiality protection those mediation communications that relate to the ongoing or future commission of a crime, as discussed in the Comments to Section 6(a)(4) [§ 9-806(1)(d)]. However, it narrows the preclusion, thus retaining broader confidentiality, and removes the privilege protection only when an actor uses or attempts to use the mediation itself to further the commission of a crime, rather than lifting the confidentiality protection more broadly to any discussion of crimes. For example, it would preclude gang members from claiming that a meeting to plan a drug deal was really a mediation that would privilege those communications in a later criminal or civil case.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Section should be read together with Section 6(a)(4) [§ 9-806(1)(d)], which applies to particular communications within a mediation which are used for the same purposes. The two differ on the purpose of the mediation: Section 5(c) [(3)] applies when the mediation itself is used to further a crime, while Section 6(a)(4) [§ 9-806(1)(d)] applies to matters that are being mediated for other purposes but which include discussion of acts or statements that may be deemed criminal in nature. Under Section 5(c) [(3)], the preclusion applies to all mediation communications because the purpose of the mediation frustrates public policy. Under Section 6(a)(4) [§ 9-806(1)(d)], the preclusion only applies to those mediation communications that have a criminal character; the privilege may still be asserted to block the introduction of other communications made during the mediation. This rationale is discussed more fully in the comments to Section 6(a)(4) [§ 9-806(1)(d)].

        1. In general.
       </h5>
       <p>
        This Section articulates specific and exclusive exceptions to the broad grant of privilege provided to mediation communications in Section 4 [§ 9-804]. As with other privileges, when it is necessary to consider evidence in order to determine if an exception applies, the Act contemplates that a court will hold an in camera proceeding at which the claim for exemption from the privilege can be confidentially asserted and defended.
    See, e.g.,
    Rinaker v. Superior Court, 74 Cal. Rptr. 2d 464, 466 (Ct. App. 1998);
    <i>
     Olam v. Congress Mortgage Co.
    </i>
    , 68 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1131-33 (N.D. Cal. 1999) (discussing whether an in camera hearing is necessary).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exceptions in Section 6(a) [(1)] apply regardless of the need for the evidence because society’s interest in the information contained in the mediation communications may be said to categorically outweigh its interest in the confidentiality of mediation communications. In contrast, the exceptions under Section 6(b) [(2)] would apply only in situations where the relative strengths of society’s interest in a mediation communication and mediation participant interest in confidentiality can only be measured under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The Act places the burden on the proponent of the evidence to persuade the court in a non-public hearing that the evidence is not otherwise available, that the need for the evidence substantially outweighs the confidentiality interests and that the evidence comes within one of the exceptions listed under Section 6(b) [(2)]. In other words, the exceptions listed in 6(b) [(2)] include situations that should remain confidential but for overriding concerns for justice.

        2. Section 6(a)(1) [(1)(a)]. Record of an agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        This exception would permit evidence of a signed agreement, such as an agreement to mediate, an agreement regarding how the mediation should be conducted — including whether the parties and mediator may disclose outside of proceedings, or, more commonly, written agreements memorializing the parties’ resolution of the dispute. The exception permits such an agreement to be introduced in a subsequent court proceeding convened to determine whether the terms of that settlement agreement had been breached.
       </p>
       <p>
        The words “agreement evidenced by a record” and “signed” refer to written and executed agreements, those recorded by tape recorded and ascribed to by the parties on the tape, and other electronic means to record and sign, as defined in Sections 2(9) and 2(10) [§ 9-802(9) and (10)]. In other words, a participant’s notes about an oral agreement would not be a signed agreement. On the other hand, the following situations would be considered a signed agreement: a handwritten agreement that the parties have signed, an e-mail exchange between the parties in which they agree to particular provisions, and a tape recording in which they state what constitutes their agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Written agreements are commonly excepted from mediation confidentiality protections, permitting the Act to embrace current practices in a majority of States.

    This exception is noteworthy only for what is not included: oral agreements. The disadvantage of exempting oral settlements is that nearly everything said during a mediation session could bear on either whether the parties came to an agreement or the content of the agreement. In other words, an exception for oral agreements has the potential to swallow the rule of privilege. As a result, mediation participants might be less candid, not knowing whether a controversy later would erupt over an oral agreement. Unfortunately, excluding evidence of oral settlements reached during a mediation session would operate to the disadvantage of a less legally sophisticated party who is accustomed to the enforcement of oral settlements reached in negotiations. Such a person might also mistakenly assume the admissibility of evidence of oral settlements reached in mediation as well. However, because the majority of courts and statutes limit the confidentiality exception to signed written agreements, one would expect that mediators and others will soon incorporate knowledge of a writing requirement into their practices.

       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the limitation on oral agreements, the Act leaves parties other means to preserve the agreement quickly. For example, parties can agree that the mediation has ended, state their oral agreement into the tape recorder and record their assent.
    See Regents of the University of California v. Sumner
    , 42 Cal. App. 4th 1209, 1212 (1996). This approach was codified in Cal. Evid. Code Section 1118, 1124 (1997).

        The parties may still provide that particular settlements agreements are confidential with regard to disclosure to the general public, and provide for sanctions for the party who discloses voluntarily.
    See
    Stephen A. Hochman,
        Confidentiality in Mediation: A Trap for the Unwary
        , SB41 ALI-ABA 605 (1995). However, confidentiality agreements reached in mediation, like those in other settlement situations, are subject to the need for evidence and public policy considerations.

        3. Section 6(a)(2) [(1)(b)]. Mediations open to the public; meetings and records made open by law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 6(a)(2) [(1)(b)] makes clear that the privileges in Section 4 [§ 9-804] do not preempt state open meetings and open records laws, thus deferring to the policies of the individual States regarding the types of meetings that will be subject to these laws. In addition, it provides an exception when the mediation is opened to the public, such as a televised mediation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This exception recognizes that there should be no after-the-fact confidentiality for communications that were made in a meeting that was either voluntarily open to the public — such as a workgroup meeting in a federal negotiated rule making that was made open to the general public, even though not required by Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) to be open — or was required to be open to the public pursuant to an open meeting law. For example, the Act would provide no privilege if an agency holds a closed meeting but FACA would require that it be open. This exception also applies if a meeting was properly closed but an open record law requires that the meeting summaries or other documents — perhaps even a transcript — be made available under certain circumstances, e.g. the Federal Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b (1995). In this situation, only the records would be excepted from the privilege, however.

       </p>
       <p>
        The policy rationales supporting the privilege do not support mediation communications that threaten bodily injury or crimes of violence. To the contrary, in cases in which a credible threat has been made disclosure would serve the public interest in safety and the protection of others. Because such statements are sometimes made in anger with no intention to commit the act, the exception is a narrow one that applies only to the threatening statements; the remainder of the mediation communication remains protected against disclosure.
       </p>
       <p>
        State mediation confidentiality statutes frequently recognize a similar exception.

        Almost a dozen States currently have mediation confidentiality protections that contain exceptions related to a commission of a crime. Colo. Rev Stat. Section 13-22-307 (1991) (general) (future felony); Fla. Stat. Ann. Section 723.038 (mobile home parks) (ongoing or future crime or fraud); Iowa Code Section 216.15B (1999) (civil rights); Iowa Code Section 654A.13 (1990) (farmer-lender); Iowa Code Section 679C.2 (1998) (general) (ongoing or future crimes); Kan.

    While ready to exempt attempts to commit or the commission of crimes from confidentiality protection, the Drafting Committees declined to cover “fraud” that would not also constitute a crime because civil cases frequently include allegations of fraud, with varying degrees of merit, and the mediation would appropriately focus on discussion of fraud claims. Some state statutes do exempt fraud, although less frequently than they do crime.
    See, e.g.,
    Fla. Stat. Ann. Section 723.038(8) (1994) (mobile home parks) (communications made in furtherance of commission of crime or fraud); Kan. Stat. Ann. Section 23-605(b)(3) (1999) (domestic relations) (ongoing crime or fraud); Kan. Stat. Ann. Section 44-817(c)(3) (1996) (labor) (ongoing crime or fraud); Kan. Stat. Ann.

Section 25-2914 (1994) (general) (crime or fraud); S.D. Codified Laws Section 19-13-32 (1998) (general) (crime or fraud).
       </p>
       <p>
        Significantly, this exception does not cover mediation communications constituting admissions of past crimes, or past potential crimes, which remain privileged. Thus, for example, discussions of past aggressive positions with regard to taxation or other matters of regulatory compliance in commercial mediations remain privileged against possible use in subsequent or simultaneous civil proceedings. The Drafting Committees discussed the possibility of creating an exception for the related circumstance in which a party makes an admission of past conduct that portends future bad conduct. However, they decided against such an expansion of this exception because such past conduct can already be disclosed in other important ways. The other parties can warn others, because parties are not prohibited from disclosing by the Act. The Act permits the mediator to disclose if required by law to disclose felonies or if public policy requires.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to emphasize that the Act’s limited focus as an evidentiary and discovery privilege, rather than a broader rule of confidentiality means that this privilege provision would not prevent a party from calling the police, or warning someone in danger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, it should be noted that this exception is intended to prevent the abuse of the privilege as a shield to evidence that might be necessary to prosecute or defend a crime. The Drafters recognize that it is possible that the exception itself could be abused. Such unethical or bad faith conduct would continue to be subject to traditional sanction standards.

        The rationale behind the exception is that disclosures may be necessary to promote accountability of mediators by allowing for grievances to be brought against mediators, and as a matter of fundamental fairness, to permit the mediator to defend against such a claim. Moreover, permitting complaints against the mediator furthers the central rationale that States have used to reject the traditional basis of licensure and credentialing for assuring quality in professional practice: that private actions will serve an adequate regulatory function and sift out incompetent or unethical providers through liability and the rejection of service.

    , 1997 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 715, 740-751. The failure to provide an exception for such evidence would mean that lawyers and fiduciaries could act unethically or in violation of standards without concern that evidence of the misconduct would later be admissible in a proceeding brought for recourse. This exception makes it possible to use testimony of anyone except the mediator in proceedings at which such a claim is made or defended. Because of the potential adverse impact on a mediator’s appearance of impartiality, the use of mediator testimony is more guarded, and therefore protected by Section 6(c) [(3)]. It is important to note that evidence fitting this exception would still be protected in other types of proceedings, such as those related to the dispute being mediated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reporting requirements operate independently of the privilege and this exception. Mediators and other are not precluded by the Act from reporting misconduct to an agency or tribunal other than one that might make a ruling on the dispute being mediated, which is precluded by Section 8(a) and (b) [§ 9-807(1) and (2)].

       <p>
        By referring to “child and adult protective services agency,” the exception broadens the coverage to include the elderly and disabled if that State has protected them by statute and has created an agency enforcement process. It should be stressed that this exception applies only to permit disclosures in public agency proceedings in which the agency is a party or nonparty participant. The exception does not apply in private actions, such as divorce, because the need for the evidence is not as great as in proceedings brought to protect against abuse and neglect so that the harm can be stopped, and is outweighed by the policy of promoting candor during mediation. For example, in a mediation between Husband and Wife who are seeking a divorce, Husband admits to sexually abusing a child. Husband’s admission would not be privileged in an action brought by the public agency to protect the child, but would be privileged in the divorce hearings.
    The last bracketed phrases make an exception to the exception to privilege of mediation communications in certain mediations involving such public agencies. Child protection agencies in many States have created mediation programs to resolve issues that arise because of allegations of abuse. Those advocating the use of mediation in these contexts point to the need for privilege to promote the use of the process, and these alternatives provide it. National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges,
    Resource Guidelines: Improving the Child Abuse and Neglect Court Process
    , 1995. These alternatives are bracketed and offered to the states as recommended model provisions because of concerns raised by some mediators of such cases that mediator testimony sometimes can be necessary and appropriate to secure the safety of a vulnerable party in a situation of abuse.
        See
        Letter from American Bar Association Commission on Mental and Physical Disability Law, November 15, 2000 (on file with Drafting Committees).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words “child or adult protection” are bracketed so that States using a different term or encouraging mediation of disputes arising from abuse of other protected classes can add appropriate language.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each state may chose to enact either Alternative A or Alternative B. The Alternative A exception only applies to cases referred by the court or public agency. In this situation, allegations already have been made in an official context and a court has made the determination that settlement of that case is in the public interest by referring it to mediation. In Alternative B exception, no court referral is required. A state enacting Alternative B would be adopting a policy that it is sufficient that the public agency favors settlement of a particular case by its participation in the mediation. [Idaho adopted Alternative B.]
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “public agency” may have to be modified in a State in which a private agency is charged by law to assume the duties to protect children in these contexts.

        The exceptions under this Section constitute less common fact patterns that may sometimes justify carving an exception, but only when the unique facts and circumstances of the case demonstrate that the evidence is otherwise unavailable, and the need for the evidence outweighs the policies underlying the privilege. Thus, Section 6(b) [(2)] effectively places the burden on the proponent to persuade the court on these points. The evidence will not be disclosed absent a finding on these points after an in camera hearing. Further, under Section 6(d) [(4)] the evidence will be admitted only for that limited purpose.

       <p>
        As noted in the commentary to Section 6, point 5, the Act affords more specialized treatment for the use of mediation communications in subsequent felony proceedings, which reflects the unique character, considerations, and concerns that attend the need for evidence in the criminal process. States may also wish to extend this specialized treatment to misdemeanors, and the Drafters offer appropriate model language for states in that event.
    Existing privilege statutes are silent or split as to whether they apply only to civil proceedings, apply also to some juvenile or misdemeanor proceedings, or apply as well to all criminal proceedings. The split among the States reflects clashing policy interests. One the one hand, mediation participants operating under the benefit of a privilege might reasonably expect that statements made in mediation would not be available for use in a later felony prosecution. The candor this expectation promotes is precisely that which the mediation privilege seeks to protect. It is also the basis upon which many criminal courts throughout the country have established victim-offender mediation programs, which have enjoyed great success in misdemeanor, and, increasingly, felony cases.

    , 7 Disp. Resol Mag. 12 (Fall 2000); Mark S. Umbreit, The Handbook of Victim Offender Mediation (2001). Public policy, for example, specifically supports the mediation of gang disputes, and these programs may be less successful if the parties cannot discuss the criminal acts underlying the disputes. Cal. Penal Code Section 13826.6 (1996) (mediation of gang-related disputes); Colo. Rev. Stat. Section 22-25-104.5 (1994) (mediation of gang-related disputes).
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, society’s need for evidence to avoid an inaccurate decision is greatest in the criminal context — both for evidence that might convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent — because the stakes of human liberty and public safety are at their zenith. For this reason, even without this exception, the courts can be expected to weigh heavily the need for the evidence in a particular case, and sometimes will rule that the defendant’s constitutional rights require disclosure.
    See Rinaker v. Superior Court
    , 74 Cal. Rptr. 2d 464, 466 (Ct. App. 1998) (juvenile’s constitutional right to confrontation in civil juvenile delinquency trumps mediator’s statutory right not to be called as a witness);

        After great consideration and public comment, the Drafting Committees decided to leave the critical balancing of these competing interests to the sound discretion of the courts to determine under the facts and circumstances of each case. It is drafted in a manner to ensure that both the prosecution and the defense have the same right with respect to evidence, thus assuring a level playing field. In addition, it puts the parties on notice of this limitation on confidentiality.

    This exception is designed to preserve traditional contract defenses to the enforcement of the mediated settlement agreement that relate to the integrity of the mediation process, which otherwise would be unavailable if based on mediation communications. A recent Texas case provides an example. An action was brought to enforce a mediated settlement. The defendant raised the defense of duress and sought to introduce evidence that he had asked the mediator to permit him to leave because of chest pains and a history of heart trouble, and that the mediator had refused to let him leave the mediation session. See Randle v. Mid Gulf, Inc., No. 14-95-01292, 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 3451 (Tex App. 1996) (unpublished). The exception might also allow party testimony in a personal injury case that the driver denied having insurance, causing the plaintiff to rely and settle on that basis, where such a misstatement would be a basis for reforming or avoiding liability under the settlement. Under this exception the evidence will not be privileged if the weighing requirements are met. This exception differs from the exception for a record of an agreement in Section 6(a)(1) [(1)(a)] in that Section 6(a)(1) [(1)(a)] only exempts the admissibility of the record of the agreement itself, while the exception in Section 6(b)(2) [(2)(a)] is broader in that it would permit the admissibility of other mediation communications that are necessary to establish or refute a defense to the validity of a mediated settlement agreement. 12. Section 6(c) [(3)]. Mediator not compelled.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 6(c) [(3)] allows the mediator to decline to testify or otherwise provide evidence in a professional misconduct and mediated settlement enforcement cases to protect against frequent attempts to use the mediator as a tie-breaking witness, which would undermine the integrity of the mediation process and the impartiality of the individual mediator. Nonetheless, the parties and others may testify or provide evidence in such cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Section is discussed in the comments to Sections 6(a)(7) [(1)(g)] and 6(b)(2) [(2)(b)]. The mediator may still testify voluntarily if the exceptions apply, or the parties waive their privilege, but the mediator may not be compelled to do so.

        1. Section 7. Disclosures by the mediator to an authority that may make a ruling on the dispute being mediated.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 7(a) [(1)] prohibits communications by the mediator in prescribed circumstances. In contrast to the privilege, which gives a right to refuse to provide evidence in a subsequent legal proceeding, this Section creates a prohibition against disclosure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some states have already adopted similar prohibitions.
    See, e.g.
    , Cal. Evid. Code Section 1121 (1997); Fla. Stat. Ann. Section 373.71 (1999) (water resources); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Section 154.053 (c) (1999) (general). Disclosures of mediation communications to a judge also could run afoul of prohibitions against ex parte communications with judges.
        See
        Code of Conduct for Federal Judges, Canon 3(A)(3), 175 F.R.D. 364, 367 (1998); American Bar Association Model Code of Conduct of Judicial Conduct at 9. The purpose of this Section is consistent with the conclusions of seminal reports in the mediation field condemn the use of such reports as permitting coercion by the mediator and destroying confidence in the neutrality of the mediator and in the mediation process.
        See
        Society for Professionals in Dispute Resolution,
        Mandated Participation and Settlement Coercion: Dispute Resolution as it Relates to the Courts
        (1991); Center for Dispute Settlement, National Standards for Court-Connected Mediation Programs (D.C. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, the prohibition is limited to reports or other listed communications to those who may rule on the dispute being mediated. While the mediators are thus constrained in terms of reports to courts and others that may make rulings on the case, they are not prohibited from reporting threatened harm to appropriate authorities, for example, if learned during a mediation to settle a civil dispute. In this regard, Section 7(b)(3) [(2)(c)] responds to public concerns about clarity and makes explicit what is otherwise implied in the Act, that mediators are not constrained by this Section in their ability to disclose threats to the safety and well being of vulnerable parties to appropriate public authorities, and is consistent with the exception for disclosure in proceedings in Section 6(a)(7) [§ 9-806(1)(g)]. Similarly, while the provision prohibits mediators from making these reports, it does not constrain the parties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The communications by the mediator to the court or other authority are broadly defined. The provisions would not permit a mediator to communicate, for example, on whether a particular party engaged in “good faith” negotiation, or to state whether a party had been “the problem” in reaching a settlement. Section 7(b)(1) [(2)(a)], however, does permit disclosure of particular facts, including attendance and whether a settlement was reached. For example, a mediator may report that one party did not attend and another attended only for the first five minutes. States with “good faith” mediation laws or court rules may want to consider the interplay between such laws and this Section of the Act.

        The evidentiary privilege granted in Sections 4 to 6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806] assures party expectations regarding the confidentiality of mediation communications against disclosures in subsequent legal proceedings. However, it is also possible for mediation communications to be disclosed outside of proceedings, for example to family members, friends, business associates and the general public. Section 8 focuses on such disclosures.

        a. Party expectations of confidentiality outside of proceedings
   
    Party expectations regarding such disclosures outside of proceedings are complex. On the one hand, parties may reasonably expect in many situations that their mediation communications will not be disclosed to others, that the statements they make in mediation “will stay in the room.” This is often the tenor of confidentiality discussions during the initial phases of mediations, when ground rules regarding confidentiality and other issues are being established. See e.g., Christopher W. Moore,
    The Mediation Process: Practical Strategies for Resolving Conflict 156
    (2nd ed. 1996); Kimberly Kovach,
    
     Mediation: Principles and Practice 109
    
    (2nd ed. 2000). Indeed, parties may choose to resolve their disputes through mediation in order to assure this kind of privacy concerning their dispute and related communications. On the other hand, those same parties may also reasonably expect that they can discuss their mediations with spouses, family members and others without the risk of civil liability that might accompany an affirmative statutory duty prohibiting such disclosures. Such disclosures often have salutary effects-such as bringing closure on issues of conflict and educating others about the benefits of mediation or the underlying causes of a dispute.
   
    The tension between these reasonable but contradictory sets of party expectations presented a difficult drafting challenge for the Committees. Confidentiality is viewed by many as the lynchpin of mediation proceedings, and the confidentiality of mediation communications against disclosures outside of proceedings may be as important to the integrity of the mediation process for some as the protection against disclosures of mediation communications in subsequent proceedings that is assured by the privilege.
    The Act takes an approach of restraint. In providing an evidentiary privilege, it established statutory law when statutory law is necessary and uniformity is appropriate: the discoverability and admissibility of mediation communications. A statute is necessary in this context because parties by private contract cannot agree to keep evidence from the courts; uniformity is appropriate because it promotes certainty about the treatment of mediation communications in the courts and other formal proceedings, thus allowing the parties to guide their conduct as appropriate.
   
    By contrast, uniformity is not necessary or even appropriate with regard to the disclosure of mediation communications outside of proceedings. In some situations, parties may prefer absolute non-disclosure to any third party, in other situations, parties may wish to permit, even encourage, disclosures to family members, business associates, even the media. These decisions are best left to the good judgment of the parties, to decide what is appropriate under the unique facts and circumstances of their disputes, a policy that furthers the Act’s fundamental principle of party self-determination. Such confidentiality agreements are common in law, and are enforceable in courts. See e.g., Doe v. Roe, 93 Misc. 2d 201, 400 N.Y.S.2d 668 (1977); Stephen A. Hochman,
    Confidentiality in Mediation: A Trap for the Unwary
    , SB41 ALI-ABA 605 (1996); Rogers & McEwen, supra, Section 9.24.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c08s9-808-STATUTORYNOTESol1b">
        b. Restatement and affirmation of current law and practices
   
    Section 8’s [this section’s] language “mediation communications are confidential to the extent agreed upon by the parties” restates the general rule in the states regarding the confidentiality of mediation communications outside the context of proceedings: It is a matter of party choice through private contract. However, the language “or provided by other law or rule of this State” also acknowledges that some jurisdictions may have engrafted upon their statutes strong cultural norms discouraging disclosures outside of proceedings, cultural norms that have resulted from consistent practice by trained mediators to establish this ground rule early in the mediation by contractual agreement, and from many professionals’ interpretation of state law to impose such a requirement. See e.g., Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code, Sec. 154.073 (a) (arguably imposing a duty of non-disclosure outside the context of proceedings). This language makes clear that the Act does not preempt current court rules or statutes that may be understood or interpreted to impose a duty of confidentiality outside of proceedings, or otherwise interfere with local customs, practices, interpretations, or understandings regarding the disclosure of mediation communications outside of proceedings.
   
    Significantly, Section 8’s [this section’s] language “or provided by other law or rule of this State” also puts parties on notice that the parties’ capacity to contract for this aspect of confidentiality, while broad, is subject to the limitations of existing State law. This recognizes the important policy choices that the State already has made through its various mechanisms of law. For example, such a contract would be subject to the rule in some states that would permit or require a mediator to reveal information if there is a present and substantial threat that a person will suffer death or substantial bodily harm if the mediator fails to take action necessary to eliminate the threat. See, e.g.,
    Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California
    , 551 P.2d 334 (Cal. 1976) (en banc) (permitting action against psychotherapist who knows of a patient’s dangerousness and fails to warn the potential victim). The mediator in such a case may first wish to secure a determination by a court, in camera, that the facts of the particular case justify or indeed dictate divulging the information to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm. See, for example, ABA Rule 1.6(b)(1) and accompanying commentary; 5 U.S.C. Section 574(a)(4)(C). This result is consistent with the ABA/AAA/SPIDR Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators, and the American Bar Association’s revised the Standards of Conduct for Attorneys. In addition, under contract law the courts may make exceptions to enforcement for public policy reasons. See, e.g.,
    
     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Astra USA
    
    , 94 F.3d 738 (1st Cir. 1996). Such agreements are typically not enforceable by nonsignatories. They are also not enforceable if they conflict with public records requirements. See, e.g.
    
     Anchorage School Dist. v. Anchorage Daily News
    
    , 779 P.2d 1191 (Alaska 1989);
    
     Pierce v. St. Vrain Valley School District
    
    , 944 P.2d 646 (Colo. Ct. App. Div. 1 1997).
   
    To avoid misunderstandings about the extent of confidentiality, it is wise for mediation participants to consider whether to enter into a confidentiality agreement at the outset of mediation for purposes of guiding their expectations with respect to the disclosure of mediation communications outside of legal proceedings. Even in the absence of such discussions, the privilege for mediation communications within legal proceedings in Section 4 to 7 remains intact, and the signatories of a confidentiality agreement cannot expand the scope of the privilege.

       <li id="t09c08s9-808-STATUTORYNOTESol1c">
        c. Legislative history
   
    Section 8 [this section] was the culmination of efforts in several drafts to understand and manage the reasonable expectations of mediation participants regarding disclosures outside of proceedings. Reflecting deeply felt values among mediators, early drafts were criticized by some in the mediation community for failing to impose an affirmative duty on mediation participants not to disclose mediation communications to third persons outside of the context of the proceedings at which the Section 4 [§ 9-804)] privilege applies.
   
    In several subsequent drafts, the Drafters attempted to establish a comprehensive rule that would prohibit such disclosures, but found it impracticable to do so without imposing a severe risk of civil liability on the many unknowing mediation participants who might discuss their mediations with others for any number of reasons. The Drafters were deeply concerned about their capacity to develop a truly comprehensive list of legitimate and appropriate exceptions. Some exceptions were obvious, such as for the education and training of mediators, for the monitoring evaluation and improvement of court-related mediation programs, but some were more subtle, such as for the reporting of threats to police and abuse to public agencies — and each draft drew forth more calls for legitimate and appropriate exceptions. As the drafts grew in length and complexity, the Drafters became concerned about the intelligibility and accessibility of the statute, which is particularly important given the important role of non-lawyer mediators and the many people who participate in mediations without counsel or knowledge of the law.
   
    Similarly, efforts to create a simpler rule with fewer exceptions but with greater judicial discretion to act as appropriate on a case-by-case basis to prevent “manifest injustice” also met severe resistance from many different sectors of the mediation community, as well as a number of state bar ADR communities.
   
    In the end, the Drafters ultimately chose to draw a clear line, and to follow the general practice in the states of leaving the disclosure of mediation communications outside of proceedings to the good judgment of the parties to determine in light of the unique characteristics and circumstances of their dispute.

    This Section provides legislative support for the professional standards requiring mediators to disclose their conflicts of interest.
    See, e.g.

    </i>
    (1992). It is consistent with the ethical obligations imposed on other ADR neutrals.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (2000) Section 12; Code of Professional Responsibility for Arbitrators of Labor-Management Disputes, Section 2(B) (1985) (required disclosures).
    Sections 7(a)(2) and 7(b) [§ 9-807(1)(b) and (2)] make clear that the duty to disclose is a continuing one.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c08s9-809-STATUTORYNOTESol1b">
        b. Reasonable duty of inquiry
   
    The phrase in Section 9(b)(1) [(1)(a)] “make an inquiry that is reasonable under the circumstances” makes clear that the mediator’s burden of inquiry into possible conflicts is not absolute, but rather is one that is consistent with the purpose of the Section: to make the parties aware of any conflict of interest that could lead the parties to believe that the mediator has an interest in the outcome of the dispute. Such disclosure fulfills the reasonable expectations of the parties, and furthers the Act’s core principles of party self-determination and informed consent by assuring the parties that they will have sufficient information about the mediator’s potential conflicts of interests to make the determination about whether that mediator is acceptable for the dispute at hand.
   
    One may reasonably anticipate many situations in which parties are willing to waive a conflict of interest; indeed, depending upon the dispute, the very fact that a mediator is familiar to both parties may best qualify the mediator to mediate that dispute. That choice, however, properly belongs to the parties after informed consent, and in preserving this autonomy, this provision not only confirms the integrity of the individual mediator, but also supports the integrity of the mediation process by providing a visible, fundamental, and familiar safeguard of public protection.
   
    Critically, the reasonable inquiry language is also intended to convey the Drafters’ intent to exclude inadvertent failures to disclose that would result in the loss of the mediator privilege. The duty of reasonable inquiry is specific to each mediation, and such an inquiry always would discover those conflicts that are sufficiently material as to call for disclosure. For example, stock ownership in a company that is a party to an employment discrimination matter that is being mediated would likely be identified under a reasonable inquiry, and should be disclosed to both parties under Section 9(a) [(1)]. On the other hand, less substantial or merely arguable conflicts of interest may not be discoverable upon reasonable inquiry and that may therefore result in inadvertent nondisclosure. In the foregoing hypothetical, for example, the mediator may not be aware, or have any reason to be aware, that he or she has membership in the same country club as an officer or board member of the company. The failure to disclose this arguable conflict would be inadvertent, not a violation of Section 9(a) or (b) [(1) or (2)], and therefore not subject to the loss of privilege sanction in Section 9(d) [(4)].
   
    The reasonable inquiry also depends on the circumstances. For example, if a small claims court refers parties to a mediator who has a volunteer attorney standing in court, the parties would not expect that mediator to check on conflicts with all lawyers in the mediator’s firm in the five minutes between referral and mediation. Presumably, only conflicts known by the mediator would affect that mediation in any event.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c08s9-809-STATUTORYNOTESol1c">
        c. Conflicts that must be disclosed
   
    Section 9 (a)(1) and 9(b) [(1)(a) and (2)] expressly state that mediators should disclose financial or personal interests, and personal relationships, that a “reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the mediator.” One aspect of this would be whether the conflict is material to the matter being mediated. Further, the Drafters chose the word “including” to convey their intent that these types of conflicts not be viewed as an exclusive list of that which must be disclosed.
    Again, the standard is one of reasonableness under the circumstances, given the Sections purpose in furthering informed consent and the integrity of the mediation process.
   
    It should be stressed that the Drafters recognize that it is sometimes difficult for the practitioner to know precisely what must be disclosed under a reasonableness standard. Prudence, professional reputation, and indeed common practice would compel the practitioner to err on the side of caution in close cases. Moreover, mediators with full-time or otherwise extensive mediation practices may wish to avail themselves of the common technologies used by law firms to identify conflicts of interest. Finally in this regard, it is worth underscoring that this duty to disclose conflicts of interest is intended to further party self-determination and the integrity of the mediation process, and is not intended to provide a cover or vehicle for bad faith litigation tactics, such as fishing expeditions into a mediator’s professional or personal background. Such conduct would continue to be subject to traditional sanction standards.

       </p>
       <p>
        Sections 9(c) [(3)] and (f) [(6)] address the issue of mediator qualifications, and, like the conflicts of interest provision, are intended to further principles of party autonomy and informed consent. In particular, these Sections do not require mediators to have certain qualifications, specifically including a law degree; nor, unlike the conflicts of interest provision, do they impose an affirmative duty on the mediator to disclose qualifications. Rather, the mediator’s obligation is responsive: if a party asks for the mediator’s qualifications to mediate a particular dispute, the mediator must provide those qualifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some situations, the parties may make clear that they care about the mediator’s substantive knowledge of the context of the dispute, or that they want to know whether the mediator in the past has used a purely facilitative mediation process or instead an evaluative approach.

        It must be stressed that the Act does not establish mediator qualifications. No consensus has emerged in the law, research, or commentary as to those mediator qualifications that will best produce effectiveness or fairness. As clarified by Section 9(f) [(6)], mediators need not be lawyers. In fact, the American Bar Association Section on Dispute Resolution has issued a statement that “dispute resolution programs should permit all individuals who have appropriate training and qualifications to serve as neutrals, regardless of whether they are lawyers.” ABA Section of Dispute Resolution Council Res., April 28, 1999.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time, the law and commentary recognize that the quality of the mediator is important and that the courts and public agencies referring cases to mediation have a heightened responsibility to assure it.

        The decision of the Drafting Committees against prescribing qualifications should not be interpreted as a disregard for the importance of qualifications. Rather, respecting the unique characteristics that may qualify a particular mediator for a particular mediation, the silence of the Act reflects the difficulty of addressing the topic in a uniform statute that applies to mediation in a variety of contexts. Qualifications may be important, but they need not be uniform. It is not the intent of the Act to preclude a statute, court or administrative agency rule, arbitrator or contract between the parties from requiring that a mediator have a particular background or profession; those decisions are best made by individual states, courts, governmental entities, and parties.

        This provision makes clear that the mediator who violates the disclosure requirements of Sections 9(a) or (b) [(1) or (2)] may not refuse to disclose a mediation communication or prevent another person from disclosing a mediation communication of the mediator, pursuant to Section 4(b)(2) [§ 9-804(2)(b)]. If a state adopts the impartiality provision of Section 9(f) [(6)], a violation of that provision triggers the same denial of the privilege. Only those states adopting the impartiality provision should adopt the second bracket [(a), (b), or (g)]; all other states should adopt the first bracket [(a) or (b)]. [Idaho adopted the first bracket.] States that do not want to adopt either bracketed option, and prefer other remedies for violations of the duties prescribed in Sections 9(a) and (b) [and 9(g)], such as roster delisting, civil, criminal, or other sanctions, would simply delete the current language of 9(d) [(4)], and insert as the new 9(d) [(4)] appropriate reference to such preferred alternative remedy.

        b. Only mediator privilege lost; party, nonparty participant privileges remain intact
       </h5>
       <p>
        Crucially, while the mediator who fails to comply with the Act’s conflicts of interest and impartiality requirements loses the privilege for purpose of that mediation, the parties and the non-party participants retain their privilege for that mediation. Thus, in a situation in which the mediator has lost the privilege, for example, the parties may still come forward and assert their privilege, thus blocking the mediator who has lost the privilege from providing testimony about the affected mediation. Similarly, to the extent the mediator’s purported testimony would be about the mediation communications of a nonparty participant, the nonparty participant may block the testimony if the mediator has lost the privilege.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only person prejudiced by the violation is the mediator who failed to disclose a conflict [or who had a bias in the dispute], and as such the loss of privilege provides an important but narrowly tailored measure of accountability. Section 9(d) [(4)] makes clear that mediators cannot avoid testifying in such situations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Drafters considered other sanctions for mediators who failed to disclose conflicts [or who were partial], such as criminal and civil sanctions. However, it rejected specifically providing for those options because of the possibility of discouraging people from becoming mediators, and because the loss of privilege sanction was deemed to be tailored to the precise harm caused by the violation.

        c. Practical operation
       </h5>
       <p>
        The loss of privilege in this narrow context raises important practical questions with regard to how a party or a nonparty participant would know that the mediator may lose, or has lost, the privilege with respect to a particular mediation. This is significant because they should have the opportunity to decide whether they wish to assert their own privilege and block the mediator’s testimony to the extent permitted by the privilege, or to permit the testimony, consistent with the Act’s underlying premises of party autonomy and informed consent.
    As a practical matter, notice is not likely to be a concern in the typical case in which the mediation communications evidence is being sought in an action to set aside the mediated settlement agreement, or in a professional misconduct proceeding or action, arising out of the conflict of interest. The parties would be aware of the loss of privilege, and indeed, the loss of the privilege is consistent with the exceptions permitting such testimony in cases to establish the validity of the settlement agreement or professional misconduct.
    See
    Sections 6(a)(6) and 6(b)(2) [§ 9-806(1)(f) and (2)(b)].
       </p>
       <p>
        However, in the more remote situation in which these exceptions would not be applicable, and the mediator’s testimony is sought under a claim that the privilege has been lost by virtue of the mediator’s failure to disclose a conflict of interest, the notice issue becomes more problematic. It may be expected that the mediator would give notice to the other mediation participants who may be affected by such a request. It may also be expected under usual customs and practices that the party seeking the privileged testimony would move the matter before a court and provide notice to all interested persons who would have the right to assert the privilege. For a challenge to the mediation privilege, those interested parties would be the mediator, parties, and nonparty participants. In any event, mediation participants are advised to consider including notice provisions in their agreements to mediate that call for participants who receive subpoenas for privileged testimony to provide notice to the other participants of such a request.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with the exceptions recognized under this Act, the Act anticipates that the question of whether a privilege has been lost would typically be decided by courts in an in camera proceeding that would preserve the confidentiality of the mediation communications that may be necessary to establish the validity of the loss of privilege claim. The materiality of the failure to disclose is not likely to be in issue in the more common situations in which the mediator’s testimony is being sought in a case other than to establish the invalidity of a mediated settlement agreement or professional misconduct arising from the failure to disclose. However, in those rare other situations in which the mediator’s testimony is being sought, the proponent of the evidence may also need to establish the materiality of the failure to disclose.

        5. Section 9(g) [(7)]. Mediator impartiality.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Impartiality” has been equated with “evenhandedness” in the Model Standards of Practice approved by the American Bar Association, American Association of Arbitrators, and the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution (now Association for Conflict Resolution). The mediator’s employment situation may present difficult issues regarding impartiality. A mediator who is employed by one of the parties is not typically viewed as impartial, especially if the person who mediates also represents a party. In the representation situation, the mediator’s overriding responsibility is toward a single party. For example, the parties’ legal counsel would not be an impartial mediator. Ombuds often are obligated by ethical standards to be impartial, although they are employed by one of the parties.
    While few would argue that it is almost always best for mediators to be impartial as a matter of practice, including such a requirement into a uniform law drew considerable controversy. Some mediators, reflecting a deeply and sincerely felt value within the mediation community that a mediator not be predisposed to favor or disfavor parties in dispute, persistently urged the Drafters to enshrine this value in the Act; for these, the failure to include the notion of impartiality in the Act would be a distortion of the mediation process. Other mediators, service providers, judges, mediation scholars, however, urged the Drafters not to include the term “impartiality” for a variety of reasons.
       </p>
       <p>
        At least three are worth stressing. One pressing concern was that including such a statutory requirement would subject mediators to an unwarranted exposure to civil lawsuits by disgruntled parties. In this regard, mediators with a more evaluative style expressed concerns that the common practice of so-called “reality checking” would be used as a basis for such actions against the mediator. A second major concern was over the workability of such a statutory requirement. Scholarly research in cognitive psychology has confirmed many hidden but common biases that affect judgment, such as attributional distortions of judgment and inclinations that are the product of social learning and professional culturation.
    See generally
    , Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,
        Choices, Values, and Frames
        (2000); Scott Plous,
        The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making
        (1993). Similarly, mediators in certain contexts sometimes have an ethical or felt duty to advocate on behalf of a party, such as long-term care ombuds in the health care context. Third, some parties seek to use a mediator who has a duty to be partial in some respects — such as a domestic mediator who is charged by law to protect the interests of the children. It has been argued that such mediations should still be privileged.
       </p>
       <p>
        For these and other reasons, the Drafting Committees determined that impartiality, like qualifications, was an issue that was important but that did not need to be included in a uniform law. Rather, out of regard for the gravity of the issue, the Drafting Committees determined that it was enough to flag the issue for states to consider at a more local level, and to provide model language that may be helpful to states wishing to pursue the issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        If this Section is adopted, the state should also choose the bracketed option with this Section in Section (d) [(4)], so that a mediator who is not impartial is precluded from asserting the privilege. Section (e) [(5)] makes this inapplicable to an individual acting as a judge, whose impartiality is governed by judicial canons.

        Some parties may prefer not to bring counsel. However, because of the capacity of attorneys to help mitigate power imbalances, and in the absence of other procedural protections for less powerful parties, the Drafting Committees elected to let the parties, not the mediator, decide. Also, their agreement to exclude counsel should be made after the dispute arises, so that they can weigh the importance in the context of the stakes involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Act does not preclude the possibility of parties bringing multiple lawyers or translators, as often is common in international commercial and other complex mediations. The Act also makes clear that parties may be accompanied by a designated person, and does not require that person to be a lawyer. This provision is consistent with good practices that permit the
    pro se
    party to bring someone for support who is not a lawyer if the party cannot afford a lawyer.
    Most statutes are either silent on whether the parties’ lawyers can be excluded or, alternatively, provide that the parties can bring lawyers to the sessions.
    <i>
     See, e.g.
    </i>
    , Neb. Rev. Stat. Section 42-810 (1997) (domestic relations) (counsel may attend mediation); N.D. Cent. Code Section 14-09.1-05 (1987) (domestic relations) (mediator may not exclude counsel); Okla. Stat. tit. 12, Section 1824(5) (1998) (representative authorized to attend); Or. Rev. Stat.

Section 655.58(5) (1990) (health care) (authorizes counsel to attend mediation). Several States, in contrast, have enacted statutes permitting the exclusion of counsel from domestic mediation. See Cal. Fam. Code Section 3182 (1993); Mont. Code Ann. Section 40-4-302(3) (1997) (family); S.D. Codified Laws Section 25-4-59 (1996) (family); Wis. Stat. Section 767.11(10)(a) (1993) (family).

       <p>
        As a practical matter, this provision has application only when the parties are compelled to participate in the mediation by contract, law, or order from a court or agency. In other instances, any party or mediator unhappy with the decision of a party to be accompanied by an individual can simply leave the mediation. In some instances, a party may seek to bring an individual whose presence will interfere with effective discussion. In divorce mediation, for example, a new friend of one of the parties may spark new arguments. In these instances, the mediator can make that observation to the parties and, if the mediation flounders because of the presence of the nonparty, the parties or the mediator can terminate the mediation. The pre-mediation waiver of this right of accompaniment can be rescinded, because the party may not have understood the implication at that point in the process. However, this provision can be waived once the mediation begins. Limitations on counsel in small claims proceedings may be interpreted to apply to the small claims mandatory mediation program. If so, the States may wish to consider whether to provide an exception for mediation conducted within these programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to accompaniment does not operate to excuse any participation requirements for the parties themselves.

        This Amendment allows parties to international commercial mediation to take advantage of the privilege protections of the Uniform Mediation Act, which typically are broader than the evidentiary exclusions of the UNCITRAL Model Law.

    This is the default situation under this Amendment to the Uniform Mediation Act. This result is reached by reading subsections (a) and (c) [(1) and (3)] together. No additional agreement is necessary.
        </li>
        <li id="t09c08s9-811-STATUTORYNOTESol12">
         If the participants prefer not to have the mediation covered by the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Act but want the mediation covered by the Uniform Mediation Act:
    The parties should agree, pursuant to Article 1, subsection (7) of the UNCITRAL Model Law to exclude the applicability of the Model Law. In this situation, subsection (d) of the Amendment provides that the default is that the mediation is covered by the Uniform Mediation Act.
    (3)
    <i>
     If the participants prefer the narrower protections for the use of mediation communications provided by the UNCITRAL Model Law and do not want to be covered by the privilege provisions of the Uniform Mediation Act:
    </i>
    The participants should agree, in a record (written or other electronic form), that the privileges under Sections 4 through 6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806] of the Uniform Mediation Act do not apply to the mediation or part agreed upon. It is important to note that this agreement does not preclude the raising of the privilege by a participant who does not know of the agreement before making the statement that is the subject of the privilege. Section 3(c) [§ 9-803(3)] provides:
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        If the parties agree in advance in a signed record, or a record of proceeding reflects agreement by the parties, that all or part of a mediation is not privileged, the privileges under Sections 4 through 6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806] do not apply to the mediation or part agreed upon. However, Sections 4 through 6 [§§ 9-804 through 9-806] apply to a mediation communication made by a person that has not received actual notice of the agreement before the communication is made.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the participants so agree, the UNCITRAL Model Law provision on the use of mediation communications, Article 10, will be the default position.

        (4)
    If the parties would like to have an open mediation, with mediation communications being available for later proceedings:

       </p>
       <p>
        (5)
    If the parties would like to have the mediation covered by another law:
    They should designate in their agreement to mediate what law that will cover the international commercial mediation, in addition to taking the steps listed in point (4). They should realize, however, that a court may be unwilling to import a law of privilege because the court might deem privilege to be an aspect of procedure governed by the forum state’s law. In addition, if the parties seek to import a mediation privilege law that is broader than that of the forum state, the court might view the agreement as an attempt to keep evidence from the tribunal and against public policy and therefore unenforceable.

       <p>
        Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Model Law is consistent with Section 8 [§ 9-808] of the Uniform Mediation Act, which indicates that mediation communications are confidential to extent agreed upon by the parties or provided in state law, when Article 9 is read together with the notes on interpretation in the to Draft Guide to Enactment and Use of UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation. The Draft Guide makes clear that the violation of Article 9 should not be a basis for sanctions unless the party disclosing understood that the mediation was governed by the confidentiality rule. The Draft Guide also makes clear that a participant may warn or disclose in the public interest despite the prohibitions. This is the current state of U.S. contract law regarding secrecy agreements as discussed in the Reporter’s Notes to Section 8. The pertinent portion of the Draft Guide states:
       </p>
       <p>
        The Working Group agreed that an illustrative and non-exhaustive list of possible exceptions to the general rule on confidentiality would more appropriately be provided in the Guide to Enactment. Examples of such laws may include laws requiring the conciliator or parties to reveal information if there is a reasonable threat that a person will suffer death or substantial bodily harm if the information is not disclosed and laws requiring disclosure if it is in the public interest. For example to alert the public about a health or environmental or safety risk. It is the intent of the drafters that, in the event a court or other tribunal is considering an allegation that a person did not comply with article 9, it should include in its consideration any evidence of conduct of the parties that shows whether they had, or did not have, an understanding that a conciliation existed and consequently an expectation of confidentiality. When enacting the Model Law, certain States may wish to clarity article 9 to reflect that interpretation.
    It is important that a reference to the Draft Guide be included in the Legislative Note, so that the courts will understand the intent of the UNCITRAL Model Law drafters.

        The drafters intend the privilege provisions to be widely applied by courts so that the mediation participants will know the breadth of the mediation communications privilege when they are engaged in the mediation, even though they may not anticipate all of the nations or states where the mediation communications might be sought or introduced. Nonetheless, the mediation participants should realize that choice of law rules in other nations and states vary and those rules may result in application of law other than that of the state where the mediation took place.
    See, e.g.
    , Asten, Inc. v. Wangner Systems Corp., No. C.A. 15617, 1999 Del. Ch. LEXIS 195 (Del. Ch. Sept 23, 1999) (applying South Carolina law to dispute arising out of Florida mediation of South Carolina court litigation between parties incorporated in Delaware because South Carolina had the most significant relationship to the transaction). In addition, courts in other nations and states may consider mediation privilege provisions to be procedural in nature, rather than substantive, and therefore apply the forum’s privilege law rather than the law where the mediation occurred. Even within the United States, the courts have acted inconsistently with respect to mediation privileges that apply where the mediation was held.
        See, e.g., United States v. Gullo
        , 672 F. Supp. 99 (W.D.N.Y. 1987) (applying a state privilege in a federal grand jury proceeding concerning communications made during mediation in state program);

For this reason, the drafters believe that courts in the United States will be most likely to apply this law to international commercial mediations occurring in other nations or states that later become the subject of a suit in the United States if the parties to the mediation have specified that it will be governed by the Uniform Mediation Act.

       <p>
        Whenever mediation occurs as part of a legal proceeding, the parties would be especially aggrieved if, in absence of full settlement, the mediator could make reports to the judge who will rule on the dispute being mediated. Such reports are specifically prohibited by Section 7 [§ 9-807] of the Uniform Mediation Act.

        6. Derogation from the Uniform Mediation Act
       </h5>
       <p>
        <p class="">
    The drafters believe that Articles 9 and 10 of the UNCITRAL Model Law achieve the same result as Section 7 [§ 9-807] of the Uniform Mediation Act. Article 10(1) prohibits disclosures by a mediator and Article 10(3) prohibits a court or arbitral tribunal from ordering disclosures. When Article 9, which broadly requires confidentiality for all mediation information, is read in conjunction with these prohibitions, it should be interpreted to include a narrower confidentiality requirement that prohibits mediator reports, including recommendations of a specific outcome, to a judge or arbitrator. This interpretation maintains the reasonable expectations of the parties regarding confidentiality and avoids a situation in which the mediator could pressure settlement by threatening to make an unwelcome report to the person who will rule in the event that the mediation does not result in settlement. 6. Derogation from the Uniform Mediation Act
       </p>
       <p>
        The Amendment, subsection (c) [(3)], provides that “nothing in Article 10 of the Model Law
    derogates
    from Section 4, 5 or 6 [§§ 9-804, 9-805 and 9-806].” Black’s Law Dictionary indicates that one law derogates another law if it “limits the scope or impairs its utility and force.” The drafters intend that the Uniform Mediation Act purposes should be achieved. For example, under the Uniform Mediation Act, a mediation communication includes any mediator statement whereas the Model Law protects only mediator proposals. This provision directs to court to protect mediator statements that were not proposals so that the protections of the Uniform Mediation Act are given full force. As a further example, the Uniform Mediation Act applies to discovery process, while the Model Law does not mention discovery. Under this provision, the court should accord a privilege during the discovery phase in order to avoid limiting the force of the Uniform Mediation Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision that the Model Law does not derogate also would apply to exceptions to the Uniform Mediation Act that are not recognized in the Model Act. For example, the Uniform Mediation Act excepts from the privilege a mediation communication that is a threat to commit a crime of violence, but the Model Law does not. The derogation provision makes clear that the court should give effect to the exception for the threat, because to do otherwise would frustrate the purposes of the Uniform Mediation Act.

        It is important to note that the Amendment incorporates by reference a specific version of the Model Law, that adopted on June 22, 2002 (included in Appendix A). An amendment of the Model Law will not change this Section.
       </p>

        Some state legislatures may hesitate to incorporate by reference and may prefer to enact the Model Law. In that situation, the State can achieve uniformity by enacting this Amendment as well as the Model Law, changing the internal references accordingly.

       <p>
        This Section adopts standard language approved by the Uniform Law Conference that is intended to conform Uniform Acts with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) and its federal counterpart, Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign) (15 U.S.C 7001, et seq. (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both UETA and E-Sign were written in response to broad recognition of the commercial and other use of electronic technologies for communications and contracting, and the consensus that the choice of medium should not control the enforceability of transactions. These Sections are consistent with both UETA and E-Sign. UETA has been adopted by the Conference and received the approval of the American Bar Association House of Delegates. As of December 2001, it had been enacted in more than 35 states.
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of this provision is to reaffirm state authority over matters of contract by making clear that UETA is the controlling law if there is a conflict between this Act and the federal E-sign law, except for E-sign’s consumer consent provisions (Section 101(c) and its notice provisions (Section 103(b) (which have no substantive impact on this Act). Among other things, such clarification assures that agreements related to mediation — such as the agreement to mediate and the subsequently mediated settlement agreement — may not be challenged on the basis of a conflict between this Act and the federal E-sign law. Such challenges should be dismissed summarily by the courts.

       One of the goals of the Uniform Mediation Act is to simplify the law regarding mediation. Another is to make the law uniform among the States. In most instances, the Act will render unnecessary the other hundreds of different privilege statutes among the States, and these can be repealed. In fact, to do otherwise would interfere with the uniformity of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the Drafters contemplate the Act as a floor in many aspects, rather than a ceiling, one that provides a uniform starting point for mediation but which respects the diversity in contexts, cultures, and community traditions by permitting states to retain specific features that have been tried and that work well in that state, but which need not necessarily be uniform. For example, as noted after Section 4, [§ 9-804] those States that provide specially that mediators cannot testify and impose damages from wrongful subpoena may elect to retain such provisions. Similarly, as discussed in the comments to Section 8 [§ 9-808], States with court rules that have confidentiality provisions barring the disclosure of mediation communications outside the context of proceedings may wish to retain those provisions because they are not inconsistent with the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       As discussed in the preface, point 5, the constructive role of certain laws regarding mediation can be performed effectively only if the provisions are uniform across the States.
    See generally
    James J. Brudney,
       Mediation and Some Lessons from the Uniform State Law Experience
       , 13 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 795 (1998). In this regard, the law may serve to provide not only uniformity of treatment of mediation in certain legal contexts, but can serve to help define what reasonable expectations may be with regard to mediation. The certainty that flows from uniformity of interpretation can serve to promote local, state, and national interests in the expansive use of mediation as an important means of dispute resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Drafters recognize that some such variations of the mediation law are inevitable given the diverse nature of mediation, the specific benefits of uniformity should also be emphasized. As discussed in the Prefatory Notes, uniform adoption of the UMA will make the law of mediation more accessible and certain in these key areas. Practitioners and participants will know where to find the law, and they and courts can reasonably anticipate how the statute will be interpreted. Moreover, uniformity of the law will provide greater protection of mediation than any one state has the capacity to provide. No matter how much protection one state affords confidentiality protection, for example, the communication will not be protected against compelled disclosure in another state if that state does not have the same level of protection. Finally, uniformity has the capacity to simplify and clarify the law, and this is particularly true with respect to mediation confidentiality. Where many states have several different confidentiality provisions, most of them could be replaced with an integrated Uniform Mediation Act. Similarly, to the extent that there may be confusion between states over which state’s law would apply to a mediation with an interstate character, uniformity simplifies the task of those involved in the mediation by requiring them to look at only one law rather than the laws of all affected states.

        The phrase “the effective date of this chapter” refers to the effective date of chapter 8, title 9, Idaho Code, enacted by S.L. 2008, ch. 35, effective July 1, 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 2 of S.L. 2008, ch. 35 provides: “The provisions of this act are hereby declared to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this act.”

       <p>
        Section 17 [this section] is designed to avert unfair surprise, by setting dates that will make it likely that the mediation participants took the Act into account in setting up the mediation. Subsection (a) [combined with (a) in Idaho] precludes application of the Act to mediations pursuant to pre-effective date referral or agreement on the assumption that most of those making these referrals or agreements did not take into account the changes in law. If parties to these mediations seek to be covered by the Act, they can sign a new agreement to mediate on or after the effective date of the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) [combined with (a) from model act in one sentence in Idaho] is based on the assumption that persons involved in mediation are likely to know about the Act and would therefore be more surprised by the non-application of the Act than the application of the Act after that point. Each legislature can specify a year or another likely period for dissemination of the news among those involved in mediation.

       <p>
        The statute does not require disclosure of either the number or the nature of the felony or felonies of which an accused has been previously convicted, to be used for impeachment purposes when he has taken the stand in his own defense; therefore, where defendant, charged with committing a lewd and lascivious act with a minor child under the age of 16 was asked the question on cross-examination, “Have you ever been previously convicted of a felony?” and the defendant answered in affirmative, it deprived the defendant of a fair trial by allowing the prosecution to continue further interrogation concerning number or nature of such previous felonies. State v. Shepherd, 94 Idaho 227, 486 P.2d 82 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the legislature did not repeal this section after adoption of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure is indicative of an intent to retain the practice of impeachment by use of a prior felony conviction. State v. Knee, 101 Idaho 484, 616 P.2d 263 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The use of a prior felony conviction for impeachment purposes did not deprive defendant of his right to a fair and impartial jury trial where a jury instruction limited the prejudicial impact by stating that the conviction could be considered only on the issue of credibility and that the conviction did not necessarily impair defendant’s credibility. State v. Knee, 101 Idaho 484, 616 P.2d 263 (1980).

        Where accused refused to answer direct question as to former conviction of felony, but answered only of having liquor in his possession without specifying whether it was a second offense, he can not complain on appeal. State v. Alvord, 46 Idaho 765, 271 P. 322 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant in a criminal action who takes the witness stand in his own behalf may be required on cross-examination to state whether or not he has ever been convicted of a felony, the objection that such answer may tend to incriminate him having no validity in such case.

        Statutes, declaring written offer to pay money or deliver an instrument or personalty equivalent to production and tender thereof, if not accepted, and providing that the debtor is entitled to a receipt and may demand a proper signature thereto as a condition precedent to the payment or delivery, are inapplicable to an oral offer by an agent of a mortgage assignee to pay the assignee of a prior mortgage the sum paid by the latter therefor.

        To stop the running of interest, it is not only necessary to tender whole amount due, but, if money so tendered is not accepted, it must be kept on deposit subject to demand of the person to whom tender is made, or, a sufficient offer in writing must be made to avoid necessity of keeping money on deposit.

        Tender is an offer to pay money coupled with a present ability to do the act. It must be definite and certain in character so as to leave no reasonable doubt that the tenderer, at the time, intended to make full and unconditional payment. Wooten v. Dahlquist, 42 Idaho 121, 244 P. 407 (1926).

        Offer of payment of $100,000 by insurance check in hand, which would extinguish defendant parents’ liability, and partially satisfy defendant son’s liability, was unconditional, and, by either the terms of the policy or this section, insurer was not liable for interest accruing on $100,000 of the judgment after the letter making the offer was mailed.

       In litigation to which the Act should apply, Sections 2(3) and (4) define criminal and noncriminal proceedings broadly. In these sections, the word “court” embraces both jury and non-jury actions. Section 2(3) defining criminal proceeding also includes a juvenile delinquency proceeding or comparable proceeding involving conduct that if engaged in by an adult would constitute a violation of the criminal law of the state. An alternative method by which a child testifies in a juvenile proceeding involving such conduct is no less important than in an adult criminal proceeding. See
    In re Gault
    , 387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967);
       In re Winship
       , 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       In noncriminal proceedings, the Act may be invoked in civil cases generally, in juvenile and family law proceedings, subject to the provisions of Section 3, and in administrative proceedings. In the context of physical or sexual abuse, the impact upon and risks to a child testifying in the courtroom in civil cases for damages, in juvenile proceedings and in family law proceedings are potentially as real as in criminal prosecutions. Similarly, the testimony of a child by an alternative method may also, for instance, be appropriate in an administrative proceeding to revoke the license of a day care center.
    “Child witness” is defined in Section 2(2) as an individual under the age of a bracketed [13] who is competent to testify and is called to testify in the proceeding. The Act thereby accommodates the diverse approaches to age currently recognized among the several states for taking the testimony of a child by an alternative method. For example, while in Georgia the taking of testimony by closed-circuit television applies to a child ten years of age or younger (Ga. Code Ann. § 17-8-55) and in Florida the age is under sixteen years (Fla. Stat. Ann. § 92.54). The approach in the Act is based upon a recommendation that the maximum age should be thirteen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “child witness” in Section 2(2) includes both a child who is a party to a proceeding and one who is merely called to testify as a witness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, as to the taking of the testimony of a child by an alternative method, the term is defined broadly in Section 2(1) to mean not only alternative methods currently recognized among the several states for taking the testimony of a child, such as audio visual recordings to be later presented in the courtroom, closed-circuit television which is transmitted directly to the courtroom, and room arrangements that avoid direct confrontation between a witness and a particular party or the finder of fact, but also other similar methods either currently employed or through technology yet to be developed or recognized in the future.

      This chapter applies to the testimony of child witnesses in all criminal or noncriminal proceedings. However, this chapter does not preclude, in a noncriminal proceeding, any other procedure permitted by law for a child witness to testify, or in a juvenile courtroom proceeding involving conduct that if engaged in by an adult would constitute a violation of a criminal law of this state, testimony by a child witness in a closed forum as may be authorized or required by law.

       Section 3 provides that in noncriminal proceedings the Act does not preclude the use of other recognized state procedures for taking the testimony of a child by an alternative method. For example, in Delaware in custody and visitation cases the court is authorized to “interview the child in chambers to ascertain the child’s wishes as to his or her custodian.” Del. Code Ann. Tit. 13, § 724. There are twenty states that have statutes similar to the Delaware statute. In addition, there are also a number of states in which a similar procedure is authorized by court rule or decisional law. See, for example, the Davidson County Juvenile Court Rules in Tennessee and the North Dakota case of
    Ryan v. Flemming
    , 533 N.W.2d 920 (N.D. 1995), authorizing a trial judge to interview a child in chambers. Section 3 also accommodates the law of eight states (and perhaps other states when children under 12 years of age are involved) authorizing or requiring a closed forum in juvenile proceedings in which criminal law violations are at issue. Thus, the Act preserves the right to utilize existing closed court procedures in an adopting state but, at the same time, also preserves the use of the other alternative method procedures provided for by the Act. The Act does not apply to or govern the taking or use of evidence obtained through discovery depositions or other discovery methods or devices authorized and regulated by the Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure of the enacting jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a legislative note, it should be observed that the bracketed material in Section 3 should be omitted in enacting states that require or substantially require an open forum in juvenile proceedings in which criminal law violations are at issue.

       Sections 4(a) and (b) set forth the procedures for instituting and conducting the hearing to determine whether an alternative method for taking the testimony of the child should be authorized. The hearing authorized in Section 4 is in the nature of a preliminary hearing or a hearing on a motion in limine to determine only whether the testimony of the child should be taken by an alternative method. The Uniform Rules of Evidence (1999), Rule 104(d) and the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 104(c) provide for conducting a hearing on a preliminary matter out of the presence of the jury if the interests of justice require. The Section 4 hearing is a separate and distinct hearing from the proceeding defined in Sections 2(3) and (4) in which, upon order of the presiding officer, the testimony is actually presented by an alternative method. See also Sections 7 and 8,
    infra
    . The hearing under Section 4 may, in the discretion of the presiding officer, be conducted in an
       in camera
       proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “presiding officer” is used in this Act to broadly describe the person under whose supervision and jurisdiction the proceeding is being conducted. It includes a judge in whose court the case is being heard, a quasi-judicial officer, or an administrative law judge or hearing officer, depending upon the nature of the case and the type of proceeding in which the testimony of a child is sought or presented by an alternative method.
    The hearing under Section 4 is initiated upon the motion of a party, the child witness, an interested individual with sufficient connection to the child to be a proper person to seek to protect the child’s best interests, or the presiding officer
    sua sponte
    , all as set forth in Section 4(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also required under Section 4(b) that reasonable notice be given to all parties, a nonparty movant, or other appropriate person. The child’s presence at the hearing is not required unless ordered by the presiding officer. The presiding officer should consider the factors enumerated in Section 6 of the Act,
    infra
    , in determining whether the child should be present at the hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conducting the hearing under Section 4, the presiding officer is not bound by the rules of evidence except for the rules of privilege, for example, as set forth in Rule 104(a) of the Uniform Rules of Evidence (1999) or Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. At the same time, if, as provided in Rule 104(b) of the Uniform Rules, “there is a factual basis to support a good faith belief that a review of the allegedly privileged material is necessary, the court [or presiding officer], in making its determination, may review the material outside the presence of any other person.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Section 4(b) also provides that the hearing to determine whether an alternative method for the presenting of the testimony of the child is to be permitted shall be conducted on the record. It is also expected that a transcript of the record of the hearing will be made available to the public and news media to the same extent as in similar motions in any other judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, subject, of course, to the presiding officer’s authority, as in any other case, to balance constitutional and privacy interests and seal from public view sensitive information that should be protected.

       In a criminal proceeding, the presiding officer may order the presentation of the testimony of a child witness by an alternative method only in the following situations:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t09c18s9-1805ol11a">
         A child witness’ testimony may be taken otherwise than in an open forum in the presence and full view of the finder of fact if the presiding officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child would suffer serious emotional trauma that would substantially impair the child’s ability to communicate with the finder of fact if required to testify in the open forum.

        <li id="t09c18s9-1805ol11b">
         A child witness’ testimony may be taken other than in a face-to-face confrontation between the child and a defendant if the presiding officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child would suffer serious emotional trauma that would substantially impair the child’s ability to communicate with the finder of fact if required to be confronted face-to-face by the defendant.

      <li id="t09c18s9-1805ol12">
       In a noncriminal proceeding, the presiding officer may order the presentation of the testimony of a child witness by an alternative method if the presiding officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that presenting the testimony of the child by an alternative method is necessary to serve the best interests of the child or enable the child to communicate with the finder of fact. In making this finding, the presiding officer shall consider:

       Section 5 sets forth the standards that must be applied by the presiding officer in determining whether to allow the child to testify by an alternative method. Sections 5(a)(1) and (2) prescribe the standards that must be applied in criminal proceedings. In the case of face-to-face confrontation, Section 5(a)(2) comports with the essence of the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in
    Maryland v. Craig
    , 497 U.S. 836, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990), that the presenting of the testimony by an alternative method is necessary to protect the welfare of the child witness and that the child would suffer serious emotional stress and be traumatized to the extent the child could not reasonably be expected to communicate in the courtroom or the personal presence of a party. The Act does not attempt to define the method or methods by which face-to-face confrontation may be avoided. Closed-circuit television projected directly into the courtroom, video-taped testimony presented in the courtroom or room arrangements or equipment that shield the witness from the defendant [or the finder of fact in the case of Section 5(a)(1)] have been used with varying degrees of approval by the courts. See
       Maryland v. Craig
       , 497 U.S. 836, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990);
       Coy v. Iowa
       , 487 U.S. 1012, 108 S. Ct. 2798, 101 L. Ed. 2d 857 (1988). The word “defendant” in Section 5(a)(2) is intended to include and incorporate the word respondent or other similar term, if any, that may be used to denote the accused in a juvenile delinquency proceeding included in Section 2(3).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 5(a)(1) and (2) establish the standard of “clear and convincing evidence” (highly probably true) as the standard that must be met in determining whether to permit the presentation of testimony of a child by an alternative method. The standard of persuasion in criminal cases currently varies throughout the several states. However, there are at least four states that apply the clear and convincing evidence standard of persuasion in determining whether to permit the presentation of a child’s testimony by an alternative method. These are: Alaska (
    Reutter v. State
    , 886 P.2d 1298 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994)); Arkansas (Ark. Code Ann.<cite class="id_code">§ 16-43</cite>-1001); California (Cal. Penal Code § 1347); Connecticut (Conn. Gen. Stat.<cite class="id_code">§ 54-86</cite>g); and New York (N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 65.10). Of these, the Alaska decision in
    <i>
     Reutter
    </i>
    seems most persuasive because of the court’s reliance on
    <i>
     Maryland v. Craig, supra
    </i>
    . In
    <i>
     Craig
    </i>
    , the Supreme Court did not address the issue other than to require specific evidence and an express finding that the probable effect of the defendant’s presence on the child witness would significantly impair the ability of the child to testify accurately. See
    <i>
     Maryland v. Craig
    </i>
    , 497 U.S. at 855-56, 110 S. Ct. at 3169. In
    <i>
     Reutter
    </i>
    , the court held that the preponderance of evidence standard was insufficient to meet the requirements of
    <i>
     Craig
    </i>
    . See
    <i>
     Reutter v. State
    </i>
    , 886 P.2d at 1308. Therefore, given the criminal nature of the proceedings under Sections 5(a)(1) and (2) and the persuasiveness of
    <i>
     Reutter
    </i>
    , it seems appropriate that any state adopting the Act should conform to the clear and convincing evidence standard of persuasion even though there are at least two jurisdictions which follow the preponderance of evidence standard of persuasion. See
    <i>
     Thomas v. People
    </i>
    , 803 P.2d 144 (Colo. 1990);
    <i>
     United States v. Carrier
    </i>
    , 9 F.3d 867 (10th Cir. 1993).

       Section 5(b) sets forth the standards that must be applied in noncriminal proceedings to determine whether to permit an alternative method for presenting the testimony of a child. In these proceedings the Act sets forth the alternative standards of “best interests of the child” or to “enable the child to communicate with the finder of fact.” However, unlike criminal proceedings, the standard of persuasion is only that the presiding officer must find by a preponderance of the evidence (more probably true than not)“that allowing the child to testify by an alternative method is necessary to protect the best interests of the child or enable the child to communicate with the finder of fact.” Given the civil nature of these proceedings and the fact that the preponderance of evidence standard generally applies to civil proceedings, this lesser standard of persuasion is appropriate for noncriminal proceedings. Sections 5(b)(1) through (5) set forth a non-exclusive list of factors that the presiding officer may consider in making this determination.

       Section 7 provides expressly for the issuance of an order either allowing or disallowing the presentation of the testimony of a child witness by an alternative method. First, Section 7(a) requires a statement of the findings of fact and conclusions of law that support the presiding officer’s determination. Second, Section 7(b) specifies the conditions under which the testimony is to be presented if an alternative method is to be ordered. Third, Section 7(c) requires that the alternative method be no more restrictive of the rights of the parties than is necessary to serve the purposes of presenting the testimony by an alternative method. In this connection, it should also be observed that the Act does not expressly provide for a priority in the alternative methods that may be ordered by the presiding officer. Nevertheless, in complying with Section 7(c), the importance of the examination or cross-examination of the child witness as provided in Section 8 strongly suggests that the alternative method authorized would normally include only video-taped testimony, closed-circuit television, or shielding the child witness in the courtroom from a face-to-face confrontation with the defendant or other party against whom the testimony is being offered.

       Section 8 ensures that the requirements of the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation will be met in criminal proceedings and, when applicable, preserves the right of examination and cross-examination of the child witness in noncriminal proceedings. However, Section 8 does not impact upon other state noncriminal proceedings where limitations are placed upon the right to examine or cross-examine the child witness through the interviewing of a child in chambers, or some other recognized
    in camera
    examination of the child witness. See Comment to Section 3,
       supra
       . When the testimony of a child witness is presented by an alternative method as permitted under this Act, such testimony becomes part of the trial or hearing record like any other evidence presented to the finder of fact.
