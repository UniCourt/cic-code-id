        As enacted the section heading of this section read: “Idaho fish and game code and department.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The fish and game law dates back to 1863-1864. It was variously amended and codified in R.S.,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.7185.html#t7185c71s7185-7197" target="_blank">§§ 7185-7197</a></cite>. S.L. 1893, p. 157, was a further codification and provided for the appointment of county game wardens by the county commissioners. S.L. 1895, p. 152, reenacted and amended the latter act, but omitted reference to game wardens, leaving the enforcement of the law to sheriffs and constables, as had been the law prior to the act of 1893. S.L. 1899, p. 428, provided for the appointment of a state fish and game warden and prescribed his powers and duties. The legislature continued to amend the fish and game regulations from time to time and by S.L. 1903, p. 188, § 8, a license was first required.
       </p>
       <p>
        The law was codified in the Revised Codes, the powers and duties of the state fish and game warden being covered in R.C.,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.195.html#t195c01s195-198" target="_blank">§§ 195-198</a></cite>; the state fish hatchery, R.C.,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.857.html#t857c08s857-862" target="_blank">§§ 857-862</a></cite>; regulations concerning fishing and hunting, R.C.,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.7180.html#t7180c72s7180-7203" target="_blank">§§ 7180-7203</a></cite>. In S.L. 1909, p. 85, the legislature repealed these sections and codified the fish and game law in one act. To this law there were numerous direct and implied amendments: S.L. 1909, p. 152; S.L. 1911, ch. 62, p. 171; S.L. 1915, ch. 90, p. 210; S.L. 1915, ch. 96, p. 220; S.L. 1915, ch. 140, p. 298; S.L. 1917, ch. 32, p. 75; S.L. 1917, ch. 37, p. 85, and S.L. 1917, ch. 56, p. 149. These were included in the rearrangement of the law in Compiled Laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature again codified the fish and game law in S.L. 1919, ch. 65, p. 203. This provided for the establishment of a bureau of fish and game in the department of law enforcement created by S.L. 1919, ch. 8, p. 43. This latter act repealed C.L. 117:1-7, 9, 10, 13-15, relating to the fish and game warden, deputies, and clerks, and gave to the department of law enforcement general powers sufficient to authorize the employment of all necessary employees for the bureau of fish and game. The provisions of nearly all of these repealed sections, however, were reenacted in parts of §§ 2-8 of the 1919 codification of the fish and game law, but as the latter part of § 53 of ch. 65 of the 1919 act provided that “nothing herein contained shall be construed to amend or repeal the provisions of an act of the 15th session of the legislature, designated senate bill 19,” (1919, ch. 8, above referred to).
    Init. Meas. 1939, amended by S.L. 1943, ch. 151, established a fish and game commission and prescribed its functions and duties.

        This is a question of the right to establish private ponds and stock them with fish under the provisions of the fish and game laws. The doctrine is well established that, by reason of the state’s control over fish and game within its limits, it is within the police power of the legislature to enact such general laws as may be necessary for the protection and regulation of the public’s right in such fish and game, even to the extent of restricting the use of or right of property in game after it has been taken.

Whenever said commission determines that the supply of any particular species of wildlife is being, or will be, during any particular period of time, injuriously affected by depletion by permitting the same to be taken, or if it should find a longer or different season, or different bag limit should be adopted for the better protection thereof, or if it finds that an open season may be declared without endangering the supply thereof, then it shall make a rule or proclamation embodying its findings in respect to when, under what circumstances, in which localities, by what means, what sex, and in what amounts and numbers the wildlife of this state may be taken.

     </p>
     <p>
      Upon request, the department shall grant one (1) hearing per transplant or relocation if any affected individual or entity expresses written concern within ten (10) days of notification regarding any transplants or relocations of bighorn sheep and shall take into consideration these concerns in approving, modifying or canceling any proposed bighorn sheep transplant or relocation. Any such hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of the request. It is the policy of the state of Idaho that existing sheep or livestock operations in the area of any bighorn sheep transplant or relocation are recognized and that the potential risk, if any, of disease transmission and loss of bighorn sheep when the same invade domestic livestock or sheep operations is accepted. Prior to any transplant or relocation of bighorn sheep into areas they do not now inhabit or a transplant or relocation for the purpose of augmenting existing populations, the department shall provide for any affected federal or state land grazing permittees or owners or leaseholders of private land a written agreement signed by all federal, state and private entities responsible for the transplant or relocation stating that the existing sheep or livestock operations in the area of any such bighorn sheep transplant or relocation are recognized and that the potential risk, if any, of disease transmission and loss of bighorn sheep when the same invade domestic livestock or sheep operations is accepted.

The director’s certification shall continue for as long as the best management practices are implemented. The director may also certify that the risk of disease transmission, if any, between bighorn and domestic sheep is acceptable for the viability of the bighorn sheep based upon a finding that other factors exist, including but not limited to previous exposure to pathogens that make separation between bighorn and domestic sheep unnecessary.
    6.(A) The director shall have the power, at any time when it is desired to introduce any new species, or if at any time any species of wildlife of the state of Idaho shall be threatened with excessive shooting, trapping, or angling or otherwise, to close any open season or to reduce the bag limit or possession limit for such species for such time as he may designate; in the event an emergency is declared to exist, such closure shall become effective forthwith upon written order of the director; in all other cases, upon publication and posting as provided in section 36-105, Idaho Code.

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      12. The director may define activities or facilities that primarily provide a benefit: to the department; to a person; for personal use; to a commercial enterprise; or for a commercial purpose.

        The words “this act”, in subdivision (e)1, refer to S.L. 1976, Chapter 95, which is compiled as<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.22.html#t22c10s22-102A" target="_blank">§ 22-102A</a></cite> and throughout Title 36. Probably, this reference should be to “this title”, being title 36, Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Idaho fish and game code, referred to at the end of subdivision (e)2, is not defined statutorily. It is believed to be a reference to all of title 36, Idaho Code, as it was enacted by S.L. 1976, ch. 95, § 2.
    The phrase “effective date of this act”, in subdivision (e)5(E), refers to the effective date of S.L. 2009, Chapter 314, which was May 7, 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        The letter “s” enclosed in parentheses so appeared in the law as enacted.

Transferred funds shall be spent pursuant to the respective appropriations for the set-aside account and the animal damage control account”; in subsection (d), substituted “seven hundred fifty dollars ($750)” for “one thousand dollars ($1,000)” near the beginning and end of paragraph 2.(A) and near the middle of paragraph 2.(B); substituted “seven hundred fifty dollars ($750)” for “one thousand dollars ($1,000)” in the second sentence of paragraph (e)2.; and, in subsection (f), substituted “seven hundred fifty dollars ($750)” for “one thousand dollars ($1,000)” near the beginning of paragraph 2.(A), and substituted “fifty percent (50%)” for “twenty-five percent (25%)” near the end of paragraph 2.(B).

        Amendments.
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section was amended by three 1998 acts — ch. 170, § 4, effective July 1, 1998, ch. 175, § 1, effective July 1, 1998, and ch. 212, § 1, effective July 1, 1998 — which do not conflict and have been compiled together. However, two of the acts — ch. 170 and ch. 175 — added and redesignated subsections differently. The compiler has attempted to resolve these differences by letting stand the addition of a new subsection (h) by ch. 175 and the accompanying redesignations of former subsections (h) through (aa) as present subsections (i) through (bb) while redesignating the addition of new subsection (bb) by ch. 170 as subsection [(cc)].
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 170, § 1, inserted “(1)” following the word “one” in subsections (n) and (q); added “and proclamation” following “Order, rule, regulation” in the first sentence of subsection (u); and added subsection (bb).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 175, § 1, added present subsections (h), (h)1. through (h)8., and (i); redesignated former subsections (i) through (aa) as present subsections (j) through (bb); and added “(1)” following “one” in present subsection (o).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 212, § 1, substituted “means” for “shall” throughout this section; inserted “(1)” following the word “one” in subsections (n) and (q); added the last sentence in subdivision (r)3; and substituted “includes” for “shall” in subsection (w).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1999 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1999 amendment, by ch. 173, in subdivision (g), added “provided that domestic cervidae as defined in section 25-3701, Idaho Code, shall not be classified as wildlife” following “state of nature”; redesignated former subdivision (bb) as present subdivision (cc), in present subdivision (cc), substituted “means the action” for “shall mean the action.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1999 amendment, by ch. 370, in subdivision (e), substituted “chapter 53, title 67, Idaho Code” for “the Idaho personnel commission act” and redesignated former subdivision (bb) as present subdivision (cc).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 53, in the first sentence of subsection (h), substituted “as defined in this subsection (h)1. through 8” for “as per Boone and Crockett standards”; in the second sentence of subsection (h), added “a score shall be determined from the antlers of the mule deer, white-tailed deer or elk as measured by the copyrighted Boone and Crockett scoring system”; in the last sentence of subsection (h), substituted “for determining the total score” for “described as follows”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 55, in subsection (t), substituted “meets the definition of a ‘resident’ pursuant to the provisions of this section” for “has been a resident of the state of Idaho as hereinbefore provided for not less than five (5) years”.
    This section was amended by two 2017 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 61, deleted “(h)1. through 8” at the end of the first sentence of the introductory paragraph of subsection (h) and added paragraph (h)(9).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 161, added subsection (dd).

Provided, that any and all license vendors, other than employees of the department of fish and game of the state of Idaho, may be required to furnish to the director, before entering upon the sale of said licenses, a good and sufficient surety bond to the state of Idaho in an amount designated by the director. Provided further that when a surety bond is furnished by a surety company authorized to do business in the state of Idaho, said bond shall be approved and accepted by the director and filed in the state office of the department of fish and game. All bonds executed by any person required to furnish the same shall cover a period of two (2) years and said bond shall be in a form prescribed by said director.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director may at his discretion furnish a scheduled bond sufficient to cover the amount designated by the director. All or any part of said bond may be paid for out of the fish and game account and shall be in lieu of any other bond requirement for the sale of licenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any bond given in accordance with this section of the statute is declared to be an official bond of the state of Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided further that no person except an employee of the department shall be authorized to issue and sell such licenses until any required bond as hereinbefore provided for shall have been properly signed, approved and filed with the director. All moneys collected by any person for the sale of such licenses in the state of Idaho, with the exception of the vendor fee to be retained by them, shall be and remain the property of the department. Any person appropriating any of said funds of the department of fish and game for his own use shall be guilty of a felony.

License vendors shall” for “Any person to whom licenses, tags and permits are consigned shall be charged with the full value thereof, less the authorized sales commission therefor as provided in section 36-306, Idaho Code, and such persons shall”; in the present fourth sentence of the first paragraph, substituted “licenses less the authorized vendor fee as provided for in section 36-306, Idaho Code,” for “licenses, tags and permits,” and inserted “if any,” following “official bonds”; in the fifth sentence of the first paragraph, substituted “all license vendors” for “all persons to whom licenses, tags and permits are consigned for sale,” substituted “may be required” for “shall be required,” deleted “tags and permits” following “sale of said licenses,” and substituted “amount designated by the director.” for “amount sufficient to cover all licenses, tags and permits so consigned.”; in the first sentence of the second paragraph, substituted “cover the amount designated by the director.” for “cover all licenses, tags and permits to be consigned for sale”; in the second sentence of the second paragraph, substituted “game account” for “game fund” and deleted “tags or permits” at the end of the sentence; in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph, substituted “licenses until any required bond as hereinbefore” for “licenses, tags and permits until the bond hereinbefore”; in the second sentence of the fourth paragraph, deleted “tags and permits” following “licenses” and substituted “the vendor fee to be retained by them” for “any commission on said amount that may be due any person selling the same as vendor thereof.”

      All persons authorized to issue licenses shall charge a vendor issuance fee of one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) upon all licenses issued, one dollar ($1.00) of which shall be retained by them as compensation for the issuance of such licenses; provided that the vendor fee for an eighth class license as that license is provided for in section 36-406(f), Idaho Code, shall be equal to one-half (½) the total vendor fee had each license, tag, permit or stamp been separately issued; provided further, the director may waive the vendor issuance fee for a license not issued by the department’s computerized licensing system. Seventy-five cents (75¢) of the vendor fee shall be retained by the department, shall be deposited in the fish and game account, and shall be used to help offset the cost of the computerized licensing system. Such vendor fee shall be charged in addition to the regular cost of the license. However, in the case of crayfish or minnow traps, beaver, bobcat or lynx tags the vendor fee shall be charged for each issuance of tags for each species regardless of the number of tags issued in said transaction.

        This section was amended by two 1995 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.

       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 64, § 4, in the first sentence, deleted “, tags and permits” following “licenses” in two places; and deleted the former last sentence which read, “Be it further provided that no resident or duplicate license shall be issued without taking the written application of the purchaser in the manner prescribed by section 36-405(a), Idaho Code.”

    The 1995 amendment, by ch. 287, § 6, substituted the present catchline for the former version which read, “Commission on Sales — Written application of purchaser”; substituted the present first sentence for the former first sentence which read, “All persons authorized to sell licenses shall charge a commission of one dollar ($1.00) upon all licenses, tags and permits for which there is a fee, to be retained by them as compensation for the sale of such licenses, tags or permits; provided that such commission fee shall be charged in addition to the regular cost of the license, tag or permits.”; added the present second sentence; in the present third sentence, substituted “vendor fee” for “commission fee” and deleted “, tag or permit” from the end of the sentence; in the fourth sentence, substituted “vendor fee” for “commission fee,” substituted “issuance of tags” for “purchase of tags” and substituted “tags issued” for “tags purchased”; and deleted the former last sentence which read, “Be it further provided that no resident or duplicate license shall be issued without taking the written application of the purchaser in the manner prescribed by section 36-405(a), Idaho Code.” Compiler’s Notes.

        § 36-408. Commission’s authority — Tags — Permits — Nonresidents limited — Outfitters set-aside. — (1) Tags and Permits
       </h3>
       <p>
        Method of Use. The commission is hereby authorized to prescribe the number and kind of wildlife that may be taken under authority of the several types of tags and permits provided for in this title and the manner in which said tags and permits shall be used and validated.
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) Limit — Licenses, Tags or Permits — Controlled Hunts. The commission is hereby authorized to establish a limit annually as to the number of each kind and class of licenses, tags, or permits to be sold or issued and is further authorized to limit the number or prohibit entirely the participation by nonresidents in controlled hunts.
       </p>
       <p>
        (3) Outfitted Hunter Tags Set-Aside. When the commission establishes a limit as to the number of nonresident deer tags and nonresident elk tags, it shall set aside, when setting big game seasons, in a statewide pool, a maximum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the nonresident deer tag and nonresident elk tag limit. These tags may be allocated to the outfitted hunters in capped hunts and controlled hunts and set aside for outfitted hunter use in general hunts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such outfitted allocated set-aside tags shall be separate from the tag numbers set for residents and nonresidents in each capped or controlled hunt, unit, or game management area. The set-aside tags shall be sold pursuant to commission rule, only to persons that have entered into a signed agreement for that year to utilize the services of an outfitter licensed pursuant to chapter 21, title 36, Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for a person to purchase any set-aside nonresident deer tag or nonresident elk tag, that person’s outfitter must submit an application with the proper fees as required by the director. If any nonresident deer tags or nonresident elk tags set aside for use in general hunts pursuant to this subsection are unsold by July 15 of the year in which they were set aside, they may be sold by the department to the general public pursuant to commission rule. If any nonresident deer tags or nonresident elk tags set aside as general capped allocated tags pursuant to this subsection are unsold by July 31 of the year in which they were set aside, they may be sold by the department to the general public pursuant to commission rule.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission may promulgate all necessary rules to implement the provisions of this subsection.
       </p>
       <p>
        (4) Deer and Elk Tag Allocation. When setting big game seasons, if the commission limits the number of deer or elk tags available for use in any game management area, unit, or zone, the commission may allocate by rule, where there are outfitted operations, a number of deer and elk tags from the outfitted hunter set-aside pool of tags for use by hunters that have entered into a signed agreement for that year to utilize the services of an outfitter licensed pursuant to chapter 21, title 36, Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to rules promulgated by the commission regarding allocation, or pursuant to this section, in capped hunts the commission may allocate the number of outfitted hunter elk and deer tags based on the highest number within each of the last two (2) years of all elk or deer tags using the services of an outfitter in each capped hunt. Any additional tags above the original outfitted hunter tag quota may come from the nonresident outfitted hunter set-aside pool or the nonresident quota in the capped hunt, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the nonresident quota for each capped hunt. In capped hunts, when tag numbers change for all users, they will apply proportionally to all user groups.
    In controlled hunts, the commission may allocate the number of outfitted hunter elk or deer tags based on a number compiled from each outfitter’s highest year within the last two (2) years of all elk or deer tags using the services of an outfitter for each controlled hunt. Any additional tags above the original outfitted hunter tag quota may come from the nonresident outfitted hunter set-aside pool or the nonresident quota in the controlled hunt, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the nonresident quota for each controlled hunt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Outfitted hunter tag use history will be provided through records from the sale of outfitted hunter tags compiled by the Idaho department of fish and game and verified use other than allocated tags recorded with the department by December 20 by outfitters. The department shall distribute the allocated outfitted tags through its point-of-sale machines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beginning December 1, 2020, all outfitted deer and elk tag use shall be verified in order to qualify for allocated outfitted hunter tag use history. Verification consists of the purchase of allocated tags from the Idaho department of fish and game or the use of an outfitter-provided agreement, including the tag number that is recorded with the department.
       </p>
       <p>
        All big game tags used in allocated outfitted hunts must be recorded by outfitters with the department by December 20 each year. An administrative fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be assessed for each allocated outfitted big game tag sold or exchanged at a point-of-sale machine. An administrative fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be assessed for each big game tag submitted for verification as being outfitted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The allocated tags shall be designated by the Idaho outfitters and guides licensing board to those authorized outfitting operations licensed for elk and deer hunting for the use by the outfitted hunter, pursuant to section 36-2107(i), Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those tags not qualified for allocated tag use history include emergency depredation, landowner appreciation program hunts, or meat packing without an outfitted allocated deer or elk tag.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission may promulgate all necessary rules to implement the provisions of this subsection.

The lottery permit can be marketed by the department of fish and game or a nonprofit organization dedicated to wildlife conservation selected by the commission. The tag will be issued by the department of fish and game to an eligible person drawn from the lottery provided in this subsection. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of gross revenue can be retained for administrative costs by the organization. All net proceeds for the tag disposed of by lottery pursuant to this subsection shall be remitted to the department and deposited in the fish and game expendable trust account. Moneys in the account from the lottery bighorn sheep tag shall be utilized by the department in solving problems between bighorn sheep and domestic sheep, solving problems between wildlife and domestic animals or improving relationships between sportsmen and private landowners.

     <p>
      Upon finding a biological need or public need or unsold licenses, including tags and permits, the commission is authorized to order a discount in fees for specific species, units, areas, zones, or gender as necessary to encourage increased license sales or to encourage hunting, fishing or trapping. The commission is also authorized to order a discount in fees to encourage the purchase of licenses in consecutive years or to encourage the purchase of multiple tags and permits. Notwithstanding the provisions of other law to the contrary, any discounted fee shall be effective only for the time period set by the commission order, and holders of licenses purchased before the discount shall not be entitled to a refund except as provided by rule.

        The 2014 amendment, by ch. 232, substituted “license” for “tag” in the section heading and rewrote the section, which formerly read: “Upon finding a biological need or public need or unsold tags, the commission is authorized to order a discount in tag fees for specific species, units, areas, zones, or gender as necessary to encourage increased tag sales, hunting or use of the resource. Notwithstanding the provisions of other law to the contrary, the discounted tag fee shall be effective only for the time period set by the commission order, and holders of tags purchased before the discount shall not be entitled to a refund except as provided by rule.”

        Section 5 of S.L. 2009, ch. 201 provided: “Legislative Intent. The legislature recognizes a benefit to the public from elk and mule deer population monitoring to assess abundance, sex ratios and juvenile production and from studies to monitor survival and mortality factors of elk, deer and moose. It is the intent of the Legislature that a Department of Fish and Game continue to monitor and study populations of elk, deer and moose, including predation by wolves, to provide this beneficial information.”

        Section 10 of S.L. 2017, ch. 195, effective December 1, 2017, provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that prior to the effective date of this act, the commission shall issue an order to discount sport licenses, sport tags and sport permits to the 2016 fees for eligible persons who purchase any form of annual license for 2017 and continue to purchase any form of annual license for every year there after through the duration of the order. The order shall be known as the ‘price lock discount order’ and shall be in effect for at least five years and until legislative review is complete. Further, the price lock discount order shall apply to any resident of Idaho who is absent from the state for religious purposes, not to exceed two years, or full-time educational purposes, not to exceed five years, who does not claim residency in any other state or country for any purpose, irrespective of whether such persons purchase any form of annual license during the period of allowed absence. Further, the Legislature finds it beneficial to apply the provisions of the price lock discount order to Idaho residents who are in the military service of the United States, together with their spouses and children under the age of eighteen years residing in the household, who have been officially transferred, stationed, domiciled, and on active duty in another state or country, and maintain Idaho as their official state of residence as shown on their current leave and earnings statement, irrespective of whether such persons have purchased any annual license during the period of official absence. Also, the commission shall submit a report to the Senate Resources and Environment Committee and the House of Representatives Resources and Conservation Committee reflecting the results of implementation of the provisions of the price lock discount order during each legislative session that the order is in effect”.

        Under S.L. 1905, p. 257, § 9, making it a misdemeanor for any person to have in his possession carcasses, heads or antlers of game animals in excess of the number provided in said act, game warden (now director) has authority to take possession of game animals, or any part thereof, from any person who has possession thereof in excess of the number prescribed in the statute, irrespective of the question as to where the animals were killed.

        Ownership acquired in game or fish is not such ownership as one acquires in chattels or lands, but merely qualified ownership; and possession of fish and game is at all times subject to such regulation as legislature may make, subject to constitutional provisions.

     <p>
      The commission shall at such times and in such amounts as, through investigations it deems proper, allow commercial fishing for fish or crustacea in the waters under the jurisdiction of the state. Commercial fishing shall mean the taking or attempting to take fish or crustacea for the purpose of selling, bartering, exchanging, offering, or exposing for sale. No person shall conduct, operate or manage a commercial fishing operation without obtaining a commercial fishing license and commercial gear tags from the director prior to engaging in such commercial fishing operation. Fishermen using five (5) or fewer traps or a single minnow net and having annual gross retail sales of five hundred dollars ($500) or less, are exempt from purchasing a commercial license. Either the licensed commercial operator or a licensed employee must be present whenever the commercial gear is operated, lifted, or fished. The director shall charge the fee as specified in section 36-416, Idaho Code, for each resident license and the fee as specified in section 36-416, Idaho Code, for each nonresident license. Said licenses shall expire on June 30 next following date of issuance. The director shall charge the following fees for the commercial gear tags: for each crayfish or minnow trap, the fee as specified in section 36-416, Idaho Code; and for each net longer than four (4) feet, the fee as specified in section 36-416, Idaho Code.

       Director to Authorize Removal of Wildlife Causing Damage. Except for antelope, elk, deer or moose when any other wildlife, protected by this title, is doing damage to or is destroying any property, including water rights, or is likely to do so, the owner or lessee thereof may make complaint and report the facts to the director or his designee who shall investigate the conditions complained of. In the case of water rights, the director shall request an investigation by the director of the department of water resources of the conditions complained of. The director of the department of water resources shall request a recommendation from the local water master, if any and, upon such examination, shall certify to the director of the department of fish and game whether said wildlife, or houses, dams or other structures erected by said wildlife, is injuring or otherwise adversely impacting water rights. If it appears that the complaint is well-founded and the property of such complainant is being or is likely to be damaged or destroyed by any such wildlife protected under this title, the director may:
       <ol>
        <li id="t36c11s36-1107ol1a1">
         Send a representative onto the premises to control, trap, and/or remove such protected wildlife as will stop the damage to said property. Any animals or birds so taken shall remain the property of the state and shall be turned over to the director.
        </li>
        <li id="t36c11s36-1107ol1a2">

        </li>
        <li id="t36c11s36-1107ol1a3">
         Whenever deemed to be in the public interest, authorize or cause the removal, modification or destruction of any dam, house, structure or obstruction erected by any furbearing animals. The director shall have authority to enter upon all lands, both public and private, as necessary, to control, trap or remove such animals, or to so remove, modify or destroy such dam, house, structure or obstruction that is injuring or otherwise adversely impacting water rights, or to require the landowner to do so. The director shall make a reasonable effort to contact any private landowner to schedule a date and approximate time for the removal, modification or destruction. No liability whatever shall accrue to the department or the director by reason of any direct or indirect damage arising from such entry upon land, destruction, removal or modification.
        </li>
        <li id="t36c11s36-1107ol1a4">
         Issue a permit to any bona fide owner or lessee of property that is being actually and materially damaged by furbearing animals, to trap or kill or to have trapped or killed such animals on his own or leased premises. Such permit may be issued without cost to a landholder applicant and shall designate therein the number of furbearing animals that may be trapped or killed, the name of the person who the landowner has designated to take such furbearers and the valid trapping license number of the taker. Furbearers so taken shall be the property of the taker. The term “premises” shall be construed to include any irrigation ditch or right-of-way appurtenant to the land for which said permit is issued.
    (b) Control of Depredation of Black Bear, Mountain Lion, and Predators. Black bear, mountain lion, and predators may be disposed of by livestock owners, their employees, agents and animal damage control personnel when same are molesting or attacking livestock and it shall not be necessary to obtain any permit from the department.

Wolves so taken shall be reported to the director within ten (10) days of being taken. Wolves so taken shall remain the property of the state. Livestock and domestic animal owners may take all nonlethal steps they deem necessary to protect their property. A permit must be obtained from the director to control wolves not molesting or attacking livestock or domestic animals. Control is also permitted by owners, their employees and agents pursuant to the Idaho department of fish and game harvest rules. For the purposes of this subsection, “molesting” means the actions of a wolf that are annoying, disturbing or persecuting, especially with hostile intent or injurious effect, or chasing, driving, flushing, worrying, following after or on the trail of, or stalking or lying in wait for, livestock or domestic animals.
     </p>
     <p>

Grizzly bears so taken shall be reported to the director within seventy-two (72) hours, with additional reasonable time allowed if access to the site where taken is limited. Grizzly bears so taken shall remain the property of the state. Livestock and domestic animal owners may take all nonlethal steps they deem necessary to protect their property.

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1996 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 64, § 1, in subdivision (b), in the second sentence substituted “owners, their employees, agents and animal damage control personnel” for “owners or their employees”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 394, § 1, in subdivision (a), in the second sentence inserted, “including water rights” following “any property”, and added the third and fourth sentences; and rewrote subdivision (a) 3. which read, “Whenever deemed to be in the public interest, authorize or cause the removal or destruction of any dam, house, structure or obstruction erected by any furbearing animals, provided that no liability whatever shall accrue to the department or the director by reason of any direct or indirect damage arising from such destruction or removal.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 294, in subsection (b), inserted “or attacking” in the first sentence and “within ten (10) days of being taken” in the second sentence; added subsection (c); and redesignated former subsection (c) as subsection (d).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 61, substituted “ten (10) days of being taken” for “seventy-two (72) hours, with additional reasonable time allowed if access to the site where taken is limited” in the second sentence of subsection (c); added present subsection (d); and redesignated former subsection (d) as subsection (e).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 161, deleted the former next-to-last sentence in paragraph (a)4, which read: “Beaver so taken shall be handled in the manner provided in section 36-1104, Idaho Code.”

      <li id="t36c11s36-1108ol1a">
       Prevention of depredation shall be a priority management objective of the department, and it is the obligation of landowners to take all reasonable steps to prevent property loss from wildlife or to mitigate damages by wildlife. When any pronghorn antelope, elk, deer or moose is doing damage to or is destroying any property or is about to do so, the owner or lessee thereof may make complaint and verbally or electronically report the facts to the director or his designee who shall, within seventy-two (72) hours, investigate the conditions complained of. If it appears that the complaint is well-founded and the property of the complainant is being or is likely to be damaged or destroyed by such pronghorn antelope, elk, deer or moose, the director may:
       <ol>

         Send a representative onto the premises to control, trap, and/or remove such animals as will stop the damage to said property.

        <li id="t36c11s36-1108ol1a3">
         Make an agreement with the owner or lessee to allow continued use of lands by the animals where damage by them has occurred to stored, growing or matured crops, prepared seedbed ground, or irrigation equipment on private property whether owned or leased. The agreement made under the provisions of this subsection may provide for financial compensation to the owner or lessee. If made, financial compensation under the provisions of this subsection shall be governed by the provisions of section 36-115, Idaho Code, and shall not be in addition to any payments for the same crop losses from any other source. Compensation for damages under the provisions of this subsection shall be available for damages done to private lands, whether owned or leased, if the owner or lessee allowed hunters reasonable access to the property or through the property to public lands for hunting purposes during the preceding hunting season or as a measure of response to depredation. This provision shall not negate the provisions of section 36-1603, Idaho Code, relating to the necessity of obtaining permission to enter private land. If necessary, the arbitration panel provided for in subsection (b) of this section shall determine the reasonableness of access allowed.

        <li id="t36c11s36-1108ol1bC">
         The department shall not be held liable or accountable for any damages occurring more than twenty (20) days prior to the initial notification of damage. However, the department may extend the period up to thirty (30) days under exceptional circumstances.
    The owner or lessee must have allowed hunters reasonable access to the property or through the property to public lands for hunting purposes during the preceding hunting season or as a measure of response to depredation, provided such access does not impact on their operations, or the claim for damages may be disallowed. Compensation for crop, prepared seedbed ground, or irrigation equipment damages claims shall not be in addition to any payments for the same crop losses from any other source and shall not include fence or other types of property damage. While fences are not subject to claim for payment, the department is allowed to provide support and assistance, including provision of materials to design, construct, and maintain fences for control of depredation. The notice of damages caused must be in written form, shall be in the form of a claim for damages substantially the same as required by section 6-907, Idaho Code, shall be attested to by the claimant under oath, and the claim shall be at least seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The claim shall not be amended after it is filed, provided however, that a claimant may file an additional claim in the event additional damage occurs subsequent to filing the initial claim. The department shall prepare and make available suitable forms for notice and claim for damages. Claims may be submitted only for the fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) in which they occurred, with allowance for submission within the first sixty (60) days of the following fiscal year if the claim occurred within the last sixty (60) days of the previous fiscal year. Any person submitting a fraudulent claim shall be prosecuted for a felony as provided in section 18-2706, Idaho Code. For purposes of this subsection, crop damages shall mean damage to plants grown or stored for profit and exclude ornamental plants, and damage to prepared seedbed ground or irrigation equipment shall include necessary parts and documented labor.

         In the event the owner or lessee and the department fail to agree on the amount of damages within fifteen (15) business days of the written claim, either party may elect to retain the services of an independent certified insurance adjuster licensed in the state of Idaho to view the affected property and determine the amount of damages. In the event the owner or lessee and the department fail to agree on the amount of damages and neither party elects to retain the services of an independent certified insurance adjuster, provisions of paragraph 4. of this subsection shall apply. The independent certified adjuster shall complete his review and determination within twenty (20) days from the date he is retained, and will report his determination in writing by certified mail to the department and to the owner or lessee. Neither the owner or lessee, nor the department, shall disturb the affected property prior to review and determination by the independent insurance adjuster. Costs associated with the services of the independent insurance adjuster shall be divided equally between the owner or lessee and the department, subject to reapportionment of the costs by an arbitration panel pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 4. of this subsection. If the department, or the owner or lessee rejects the determination of the adjuster, they shall notify the other party in writing of the rejection within five (5) business days of receipt of the adjuster’s determination. In the event that either party rejects the adjuster’s determination, the provisions of paragraph 4. of this subsection shall apply.

         Within five (5) business days of a rejection of an adjuster’s determination of damages or failure of the owner or lessee and the department to agree on damages when a certified insurance adjuster is not used, the director must convene an arbitration panel. To convene an arbitration panel, the director must, within five (5) business days, appoint the department’s representative and notify the landholder of the appointment. The landholder(s) shall, within the next five (5) business days following such notice from the department, appoint his representative and notify the department of the appointment. Within the next five (5) business days, the department representative and the landholder must mutually appoint the third arbitrator.

       Any claim received by the department under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section must be processed by the department within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt. If the claim is approved for payment, payment must be made within forty-five (45) calendar days of such approval. Any damage claim determination by an independent insurance adjuster pursuant to subsection (b)3. of this section, accepted by the parties, must be paid by the department within forty-five (45) calendar days of the determination. If the claim is arbitrated, the arbitration must be completed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of filing the claim for such damages.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The panel shall convene within thirty (30) days of the selection of the third arbitrator, and render its decision within fourteen (14) days after the hearing. When convened, the arbitration panel shall have the same authority to make on-site inspections as the department. The owner or lessee shall be responsible for payment of the expenses of his appointee; the director shall pay the expenses of his appointee from the expendable big game depredation fund; and the expenses of the third member shall be a joint responsibility of the owner or lessee, and the department. Provided however, the panel is authorized to review the costs associated with retaining the independent insurance adjuster and to determine whether those costs should instead be borne solely by the owner or lessee, solely by the department, or be apportioned between the owner or lessee and the department. In cases where an independent insurance adjuster was used, the party electing to use the adjuster shall assume the insurance adjuster’s determination of damage as their estimate of damage. The panel shall consider the claim submitted by the owner or lessee, and the estimate of damages submitted by the department, and shall select one amount or the other as being the closest to the actual damages sustained by the claimant. The arbitration panel shall report its decision in writing to both the owner or lessee and to the department within ten (10) days of the decision, and the decision of the panel shall be binding on the owner or lessee and the department. The fish and game advisory committee shall develop guidelines to govern arbitration procedures in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2018, ch. 350 provided: “Legislative intent. The Legislature of the State of Idaho makes the following findings and declares the following statement of intent and legislative purpose:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Under Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho, ‘acquiring, possessing and protecting property’ is an inalienable right. The right to own real property and to exclude others from that property according to law is fundamental to our rights as citizens and has been upheld repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Section 23, Article I of the Idaho Constitution also protects the right to hunt and fish, but that right expressly does not include ‘a right to trespass on private property.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The Legislature finds that trespassing on private property has become a serious problem for landowners throughout the state. While many individuals respect private property rights, landowners report a significant number of persons who blatantly disregard the rights of property owners and frequently cause damage to private property, including cut fences, ruined crops, vandalism and theft.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) The trespass laws of the State of Idaho have been insufficient to deter trespassing and have offered inadequate penalties when trespassers are prosecuted.
    “(5) Moreover, the existing trespass laws are a confusing, inconsistent and constitutionally suspect patchwork of laws. They impose significant posting burdens on landowners, without reducing trespassing. The poor construction of the laws of trespass hinders the effective arrest and prosecution of trespassers.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) It is the intent of the Legislature in passing this act to cultivate a new culture of respect for private property rights and a renewal of the neighborly ways that have been a hallmark of our state.”

For purposes of this section, livestock shall be defined as domestic cattle, sheep, and goats. For purposes of this section, grizzly bear shall be defined as any grizzly bear not protected by the federal endangered species act. If it appears that the complaint is well founded and livestock, berries, bees, beehives or honey of the complainant has been damaged or destroyed by such black bear, grizzly bear or mountain lion, APHIS/ADC shall so inform the owner or his representative of the extent of physical damage or destruction in question. The owner shall provide the director or the department’s regional office with the APHIS/ADC determination of damages or destruction. The physical damages, without establishing a monetary value thereon, as determined by the APHIS/ADC representative shall be final, and shall be binding upon the owner or his representative and on the department.

The director may respond pursuant to section 36-1108(a)1. and 2., Idaho Code. If it appears that the complaint is well founded and the forage is being or is likely to be damaged or destroyed or consumed by grazing wildlife, the owner or lessee shall contract with a qualified range management consultant to prepare an estimate of depredation based on his inspection. The cost of the consultant shall be paid by the owner or lessee. After the initial complaint, it shall be the responsibility of both the department and the owner or lessee to jointly design and implement a mutually agreeable method of determining forage utilization and damage or loss due to wildlife, which may include use of exclosure cages or other devices.

        Although this section provides statutory authority supporting the use of check stations by the department of fish and game to check fish and game licenses and lawful possession of wildlife, where a checkpoint was set up with the department inviting other law enforcement agencies to participate and was not confined to the advancement of the state’s interest in the conservation of wildlife and was without specific policy or procedures to be followed, it violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and resulted in the unreasonable search and seizure of defendant charged with driving under the influence.

        In a prosecution for wasting a game animal in violation of this section, a witness’ mere presence during the events for which the defendant was convicted and his singular act of moving a more culpable hunting companion’s vehicle at the latter’s insistence fell far short of establishing that the witness was an accomplice as a matter of law, and the jury rationally found that his role was more akin to that of an acquiescing bystander; thus, conviction could be had on the witness’ uncorroborated testimony.

        This section, prohibiting the waste of game animals, is silent with regard to any requirement that the person who is charged with violation of this section must also be the same person who killed the animal; thus, although the defendant was found not guilty of illegally shooting at or killing a deer, but guilty of wasting it, the verdicts on all the charges were rationally reconcilable.

        The Idaho fish and game code, referred to at the end of subsection (1), is not defined statutorily. It is believed to be a reference to all of title 36, Idaho Code, as enacted by S.L. 1975, ch. 95, § 2.

        The reference to the Idaho peace officer standards and training advisory council, in the introductory paragraph in subsection (2), should probably be to the Idaho peace officers standards and training council.

       Seizure of Evidence — Confiscation of Unlawfully Used Equipment. The director and all other officers empowered to enforce fish and game laws are hereby authorized at any time to seize and hold as evidence any powder, explosives, lime, toxicants, drugs, spears, traps, snares, guns, tackle, nets, seines or any other hunting, trapping or fishing equipment or devices used in the commission of a violation of any provisions of this title or rules or proclamations promulgated pursuant thereto, provided that all lawful traps, guns, spears, tackle, nets and seines taken from the possession of any person arrested for a violation of this title and held as evidence in any prosecution resulting from such arrest shall not be subject to confiscation but the same shall be returned to the person from whom taken when no longer needed as evidence. Provided, however, if it appears from the evidence before the magistrate hearing the case that the powder, explosive, lime, toxicants, drugs, or other unlawful means and devices were used or were about to be used for the unlawful taking or killing of wildlife, said magistrate shall order the same confiscated and sold by the director at public sale, the proceeds therefrom turned into the fish and game account. Any guns, fishing tackle, nets, traps or other equipment used in the taking of wildlife unlawfully and for which no lawful owner can be determined or any such equipment seized as evidence in a case and for which an owner is known, if not claimed within six (6) months following the final disposition of the case in question, shall be deemed to be the property of the fish and game department; provided, that this shall not occur unless written notice is given to the lawful owner, when known, by registered mail to his last known address within thirty (30) days after the final disposition of the case. Equipment so obtained may be sold by the department unless it would be unlawful for the general public to own or possess such equipment. Any proceeds from the sale of such equipment that would be lawful for the general public to own or possess, shall be deposited in the fish and game account.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2018, ch. 350 provided: “Legislative intent. The Legislature of the State of Idaho makes the following findings and declares the following statement of intent and legislative purpose:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Under Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho, ‘acquiring, possessing and protecting property’ is an inalienable right. The right to own real property and to exclude others from that property according to law is fundamental to our rights as citizens and has been upheld repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Section 23, Article I of the Idaho Constitution also protects the right to hunt and fish, but that right expressly does not include ‘a right to trespass on private property.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The Legislature finds that trespassing on private property has become a serious problem for landowners throughout the state. While many individuals respect private property rights, landowners report a significant number of persons who blatantly disregard the rights of property owners and frequently cause damage to private property, including cut fences, ruined crops, vandalism and theft.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) The trespass laws of the State of Idaho have been insufficient to deter trespassing and have offered inadequate penalties when trespassers are prosecuted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) Moreover, the existing trespass laws are a confusing, inconsistent and constitutionally suspect patchwork of laws. They impose significant posting burdens on landowners, without reducing trespassing. The poor construction of the laws of trespass hinders the effective arrest and prosecution of trespassers.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) It is the intent of the Legislature in passing this act to cultivate a new culture of respect for private property rights and a renewal of the neighborly ways that have been a hallmark of our state.”

        Where defendant was apprehended hiking quickly down a road in the woods dressed in camouflage clothing, carrying nearly all the necessary accouterments of a hunter, including an elk call which protruded from his lips and, just a half an hour prior, defendant had freely stated that he was waiting for his co-workers so that he could go hunting, but that, if the co-workers didn’t arrive soon, he was going hunting without them, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant was “hunting” within the statutory meaning of the term.

      Provided further, that any person who pleads guilty, is found guilty of, or is convicted of illegal killing, illegal possession or illegal waste of a trophy big game animal as defined in section 36-202(h), Idaho Code, shall reimburse the state for each animal so killed, possessed or wasted, as follows:

      1. Trophy mule deer: two thousand dollars ($2,000) per animal killed, possessed or wasted;

      4. Trophy bighorn sheep: ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per animal killed, possessed or wasted;

     <p>
      For each additional animal of the same category killed, possessed or wasted during any twelve (12) month period, the amount to be reimbursed shall double from the amount for each animal previously illegally killed, possessed or wasted. For example, the reimbursable damages for three (3) elk illegally killed during a twelve (12) month period would be five thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($5,250), calculated as follows: seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for the first elk; one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for the second elk; and three thousand dollars ($3,000) for the third elk. In the case of three (3) trophy elk illegally killed in a twelve (12) month period, the reimbursable damages would be thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) calculated as follows: five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the first elk, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the second elk, and twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) for the third elk. Provided however, that wildlife possessing a fifty dollar ($50.00) reimbursement value shall be figured at the same rate per each animal in violation, without compounding.
    (b) In every case of a plea of guilty, a finding of guilt or a conviction of unlawfully releasing any fish species into any public body of water in the state, the court before whom the plea of guilty, finding of guilt, or conviction is obtained shall enter judgment ordering the defendant to reimburse the state for the cost of the expenses, not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), incurred by the state to correct the damage caused by the unlawful release. For purposes of this subsection, “unlawfully releasing any fish species” means a release of any species of live fish, or live eggs thereof, in the state without the permission of the director of the department of fish and game; provided, that no permission is required when fish are being freed from a hook and released at the same time and place where caught or when crayfish are being released from a trap at the same time and place where caught.

        Sections 36-202(h) and 36-1401(c) and subsection (a) of this section are not unconstitutionally vague due to a failure to define the Boone and Crockett measuring standards for determining big game trophy animals, because a definition of every term in a criminal statute is not required.

        Former subdivision (1)(c) of this section is unconstitutional but is not an indispensable part of the statute and may be stricken therefrom; the rest of the statute is fully operative in the absence of that portion. State v. Casey, 125 Idaho 856, 876 P.2d 138 (1994) (see 2010 amendment).

       <p>
        Former subdivision (1)(c) of this section reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Its prohibition against someone entering or remaining on property with the “intent to interfere” includes protected speech in its proscriptions. The subsection does not require physical interference and it is not limited to prohibiting unprotected speech, such as fighting words or obscenity; thus, a substantial amount of protected speech could be affected—and chilled—by the statute, and there is a realistic danger that the statute could significantly compromise recognized First Amendment rights.

        Although the definition under the former statute referred only to navigability of streams for purposes of fishing, it was similar to the common-law definition of navigability for other purposes and had been applied to determine navigability both for purposes of fishing and for other purposes such as recreation or commerce.

        Where the evidence indicated that a six-inch log could be floated on an estuary, that the estuary had, for four decades, been used for fishing, boating, hunting, picnicking and sightseeing and that the building of a downstream dam had not substantially affected the water level in the estuary, the estuary was a navigable stream within the meaning of the former statute.

       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Under Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho, ‘acquiring, possessing and protecting property’ is an inalienable right. The right to own real property and to exclude others from that property according to law is fundamental to our rights as citizens and has been upheld repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Section 23, Article I of the Idaho Constitution also protects the right to hunt and fish, but that right expressly does not include ‘a right to trespass on private property.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The Legislature finds that trespassing on private property has become a serious problem for landowners throughout the state. While many individuals respect private property rights, landowners report a significant number of persons who blatantly disregard the rights of property owners and frequently cause damage to private property, including cut fences, ruined crops, vandalism and theft.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) The trespass laws of the State of Idaho have been insufficient to deter trespassing and have offered inadequate penalties when trespassers are prosecuted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) Moreover, the existing trespass laws are a confusing, inconsistent and constitutionally suspect patchwork of laws. They impose significant posting burdens on landowners, without reducing trespassing. The poor construction of the laws of trespass hinders the effective arrest and prosecution of trespassers.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) It is the intent of the Legislature in passing this act to cultivate a new culture of respect for private property rights and a renewal of the neighborly ways that have been a hallmark of our state.”

        Section 1 of S.L. 2018, ch. 350 provided: “Legislative intent. The Legislature of the State of Idaho makes the following findings and declares the following statement of intent and legislative purpose:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Under Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho, ‘acquiring, possessing and protecting property’ is an inalienable right. The right to own real property and to exclude others from that property according to law is fundamental to our rights as citizens and has been upheld repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Section 23, Article I of the Idaho Constitution also protects the right to hunt and fish, but that right expressly does not include ‘a right to trespass on private property.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The Legislature finds that trespassing on private property has become a serious problem for landowners throughout the state. While many individuals respect private property rights, landowners report a significant number of persons who blatantly disregard the rights of property owners and frequently cause damage to private property, including cut fences, ruined crops, vandalism and theft.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) The trespass laws of the State of Idaho have been insufficient to deter trespassing and have offered inadequate penalties when trespassers are prosecuted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) Moreover, the existing trespass laws are a confusing, inconsistent and constitutionally suspect patchwork of laws. They impose significant posting burdens on landowners, without reducing trespassing. The poor construction of the laws of trespass hinders the effective arrest and prosecution of trespassers.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) It is the intent of the Legislature in passing this act to cultivate a new culture of respect for private property rights and a renewal of the neighborly ways that have been a hallmark of our state.”

        This section applies to public entities; therefore, the city was immune from liability for personal injury to a child who fell from a swing in a city park. McGhee ex rel. McGhee v. City of Glenns Ferry, 111 Idaho 921, 729 P.2d 396 (1986).

       <p>
        This recreational statute applies to public parks, and, although this section’s applicability to the city park was not addressed in the lease between the city and the electric company who owned the park, the lease provided that the city would maintain the park and its equipment and, as such, memorialized the shift in “control of the premises” and the shift in responsibility, as well as immunity, from the company to the city.

        The snowmobile registration fee required under Idaho law (§ 67-7103) is not a “charge” for purposes of this section. Albertson v. Fremont County, 834 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (D. Idaho 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        As plainly read in the context of this section, the statutory language unambiguously demonstrates that the terms “charge” and “compensation” only reflect payment for direct use or admission to the property. Hayes v. City of Plummer, 159 Idaho 168, 357 P.3d 1276 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Character of the property as a gratuitously accessible public recreational space is dispositive when determining whether the compensation exception to this section applies. Hayes v. City of Plummer, 159 Idaho 168, 357 P.3d 1276 (2015).

        Private pilots and aircraft owners—both recreational and business users—have a “special relationship” with the city which precluded city from claiming immunity under this section for damage to private pilot’s airplane even though airplane was used only for recreational purposes.

       <p>
        Since no inference of implied invitation could arise in the face of the uncontroverted evidence of the tubular steel barricade placed across the road and the numerous and clearly visible “no trespassing” signs, motorcyclist who was killed in accident was not on private property by reason of implied invitation. Rice v. Miniver, 112 Idaho 1069, 739 P.2d 368 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute was intended to insulate landowners only from liability predicated on a duty of care owed to an invitee or licensee. Ambrose ex rel. Ambrose v. Buhl Joint Sch. Dist. No. 412, 126 Idaho 581, 887 P.2d 1088 (Ct. App. 1995).

        United States was an owner within the meaning of this section, where a snowmobile operator was injured on a snowmobile trail that was on national forest land. Albertson v. Fremont County, 834 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (D. Idaho 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        County was not a owner for purposes of this section, where its cost-share agreement with the federal government, as to its interest in maintaining groomed snowmobile trail systems on the national forest, did not entitle the county to grant admittance or deny access to use of the snowmobile trails.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section was intended to insulate landowners only from liability predicated on a duty of care owed to an invitee or licensee and it was the intention of the legislature that for liability purposes those who use property for recreational purposes under the statute will be treated the same as if they had been trespassers. Jacobsen v. City of Rathdrum, 115 Idaho 266, 766 P.2d 736 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public without charge for recreational purposes. The statute accomplishes this purpose by generally limiting the duty of care owed by the landowner to recreational users. Public entities are landowners under terms of the statute. Ambrose ex rel. Ambrose v. Buhl Joint Sch. Dist. No. 412, 126 Idaho 581, 887 P.2d 1088 (Ct. App. 1995).

       </p>
       <p>
        The stated legislative determination that the limitation of liability in this section will “encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public without charge for recreational purposes” is a rational legislative judgment; accordingly, this statute survives the rational basis equal protection test.

        Where the plaintiff and his friends had been to the monument on the landowner’s property and had driven back to the vicinity of the sandpit’s edge in order to allow the plaintiff to relieve himself, when the plaintiff fell into the sandpit and injured himself, there was a question of fact as to whether plaintiffs activity fell within the ambit of the recreational land use statute; thus, summary judgment was inappropriate.

        It would be entirely artificial to apply this section to activities of students up to the moment the first bell rings and classes begin.

        This section provides a limitation on liability for a citizen’s injuries because the city does not charge or receive compensation from the citizen or the public for use and enjoyment of a school park; the intent and purpose of the statute is to provide recreational access at no cost to the general public, and the city and the school district do that by allocating resources in order to provide and maintain the park for all to enjoy.

        A landowner owes a duty of care to a trespasser and, thus, a person using the land for recreational purposes, in two circumstances. First, it is a landowner’s duty to a trespasser to refrain from wilful or wanton acts which might cause injuries. Second, the landowner may be liable for injuries to a trespassing child under the attractive nuisance doctrine. Ambrose ex rel. Ambrose v. Buhl Joint Sch. Dist.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the creation, establishment or enlargement of any heretofore established or hereafter to be established cooperative wildlife restoration project or migratory bird reservation, as provided in sections 36-1801 and 36-1806, Idaho Code, shall contemplate, require or involve the acquisition of privately owned property by either the state of Idaho or the United States, neither the state of Idaho, the Idaho fish and game commission, nor any other officer, person or agency of the state of Idaho authorized to act for the state of Idaho shall consent to, approve of, concur in, assent to or authorize establishment of or enlargement of any cooperative wildlife restoration project or migratory bird reservation unless a public hearing has been held in the county or counties where the proposed cooperative wildlife restoration project or migratory bird reservation is to be established or enlarged or the proposed lands are to be acquired and until fifteen (15) days shall have elapsed following such hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of such public hearing shall be given by certified mail to the board of county commissioners of the county or counties affected and by publication in a newspaper or newspapers having general circulation within such county or counties. Such publication shall be given so that the first such publication shall be at least ten (10) and not more than fifteen (15) days before the date of hearing and if published weekly, shall be published in at least two (2) successive issues and if published daily, shall be published in at least seven (7) successive issues. The notices shall contain a brief description of the proposed project and a general description of the proposed location thereof and the place and time of hearing and state that all interested persons may appear and be heard.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the hearing, the commission shall present or cause to be presented oral and documentary evidence as to the land areas affected, the existing use of and production from said lands, the probable changes in use and production of said lands if included in such project, the existing tax to all taxing districts payable from such lands and the estimated amount of any payments in lieu of taxes, if any, and to what taxing district such in-lieu payments will be made if the lands be included in such project. The board of county commissioners of the county or counties affected and other persons present may present oral or documentary evidence upon any of the above matters and upon any other matters showing the economic effect the proposal would have upon the county or counties and their residents. Statements will be received, either oral or written, from any county resident present who shall wish to make his views known either in favor of or in opposition to such proposed project. From and after such hearing the board of county commissioners of the county or counties affected shall have fifteen (15) days to recommend and file approval or disapproval of such proposed project. Failure of the board to act within said period shall be deemed approval by them of the proposed project. If the board of any county affected shall recommend disapproval of such project, then the state of Idaho or any agency, commission or officer thereof shall not consent, concur, approve or assent to such project without first giving serious consideration to the objections of the board of county commissioners and filing with the board of county commissioners a written statement reasonably explaining the reasons for giving the consent, concurrence, approval or assent in the face of such objections. In the event [of] no such consent, concurrence, approval or assent is given, nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent reconsideration of such proposals, or modification thereof, from time to time upon the same procedures for notice and hearing as set forth hereinabove.
    No assent, approval, consent, or recommendation, as required by sections 36-1801 or 36-1806, Idaho Code, shall be of any force or effect until the requirements for notice and hearing as set forth herein have been satisfied. Nothing in this chapter shall be applicable to land purchases of five (5) acres or less.

     <p>
      The natural resources of the state of Idaho are an invaluable asset to every community in which they abound. Every year, in rapidly increasing numbers, the inhabitants of the state of Idaho and nonresidents are enjoying the benefits of Idaho’s recreational opportunities. The tourist trade is of vital importance to the state of Idaho, and the recreational value of Idaho’s natural resources is such that the number of persons who are each year participating in their enjoyment is steadily increasing. The intent of this legislation is to promote and encourage residents and nonresidents alike to participate in the enjoyment and use of the deserts, mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs and other natural resources of Idaho, and the fish and game therein, and to that end to regulate and license those persons who undertake for compensation to provide equipment and personal services to such persons, for the explicit purpose of safeguarding the health, safety, welfare and freedom from injury or danger of such persons, in the exercise of the police power of this state. It is not the intent of this legislation to interfere in any way with the business of livestock operations, private property rights, nor to prevent the owner of pack animals from using same to accommodate friends where no consideration is involved for the use thereof, nor is it the intent of this legislation to interfere in any way with the right of the general public to enjoy the recreational value of Idaho’s deserts, mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs and other natural resources when the services of commercial outfitters and guides are not utilized, nor to interfere with the right of the United States to manage the public lands under its control.

        This chapter does not directly conflict with the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 (46 USCS §§ 1451 to 1489) or the former Small Passenger-Carrying Vessels Act (46 USCS §§ 390 to 390g, 404) and those statutes do not evince a clear and manifest congressional intent to preempt the state’s regulation of commercial rafting operations. Grand Canyon Dories, Inc. v. Idaho Outfitters & Guides Bd., 709 F.2d 1250 (9th Cir. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 (46 USCS §§ 1451 to 1489) is directed toward ensuring that recreational boats and equipment are manufactured according to federal standards and addresses the use of boats to a limited extent, but is not directed toward the activities covered by this chapter. In contrast to the federal act, this chapter seeks to ensure safety in white-water rafting, hunting, and other activities conducted for profit by guides and outfitters. Grand Canyon Dories, Inc. v. Idaho Outfitters & Guides Bd., 709 F.2d 1250 (9th Cir. 1983).

        This chapter does not violate right to equal protection even though a private land owner can engage in outfitting without a license so long as he does not charge for the service. The legislature’s distinction between commercial and noncommercial outfitting is rationally related to its expressed objective of “safeguarding the health, safety, welfare and freedom” of individuals while in turn “promot[ing] and encourag[ing] residents and nonresidents alike to participate in the enjoyment and use” of Idaho’s natural resources.

       </p>

        In enacting this chapter, the legislature intended to regulate commercial outfitting whether it occurs on public or private land and such regulation is a reasonable use of the legislature’s police power. State v. Koller, 122 Idaho 409, 835 P.2d 644 (1992).

      It is the intent of the legislature by this act to provide for and control the establishment and operation of shooting preserves and to do so in such a manner as to be in the best public interest. Pursuant thereto the director of the Idaho fish and game department is hereby authorized to issue shooting preserve licenses for the purpose of permitting shooting of privately owned upland game birds on privately owned premises as hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the Idaho fish and game commission is hereby authorized to make rules and proclamations consistent with and for the purpose of carrying out, administering and enforcing the provisions of this act. During the shooting preserve season, the hunting and shooting of upland game birds on such preserves shall be open to any holder of a valid license of the proper class following payment of the required shooting fee established by the licensed shooting preserve operator.
