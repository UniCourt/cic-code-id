        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2016, ch. 273 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify the scope and effect of Idaho’s statutes governing tax deeds. In the case of
    Regan v. Owen
    , the Idaho Supreme Court addressed whether a tax deed issued pursuant to Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, has the effect of extinguishing an otherwise valid private easement across the subject property. Similar legislative language exists with respect to counties in Section 31-808, Idaho Code, with respect to irrigation entities in Section 43-720, Idaho Code, and with respect to cities in Section 50-1823, Idaho Code. The court did not decide the issue, but remanded to a lower court. The lower court subsequently ruled that, despite the harsh result, the statute has this effect. While a private access easement was at issue there, the reasoning would also result in the elimination of public utility easements, ditch rights, public highways and rights-of-way, conservation easements, and all manner of third-party rights in the land including, for example, interests of remaindermen following a life estate. By this legislation, the Idaho Legislature rejects that conclusion. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow local governments to destroy valid property interests held by third parties in land that is subject to a sale or other conveyance based on a tax delinquency, except where notice and opportunity to cure is provided under the statute. Doing so would constitute an uncompensated taking of property under both the Idaho Constitution and the United States Constitution. The Legislature would never have intended such a result and, by this legislation, makes that clear. As its context should have made evident, the purpose of Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, and the other referenced sections, has always been to convey title absolutely free and clear of liens and mortgages of a monetary nature. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow a local governmental entity to convey more than the delinquent taxpayer owned and thereby to destroy valid property interests held by others without notice and an opportunity to cure. This clarification brings the interpretation of Idaho’s tax deed statute into line with the interpretation of similar statutes in other jurisdictions, as had always been the Legislature’s intent.”

        Tax credits allocated under the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC), 26 USCS § 42, were not a contract right exempt from consideration in the valuation of real property. The tax credits were better characterized as rights and privileges belonging to the land under the definition of real property, as they did not exist separate from an ownership right in the low-income housing.

        The rule generally recognized by courts with reference to taxation of lands for which patent has not yet issued is that when payment in full has been made and settlement and improvement have been had, and final proof thereof has been made, and proper authorities of the interior department have accepted the proof and issued a final receipt to that effect, it operates to transfer such an equitable estate in lands to purchaser and settler as to immediately render land liable to taxation, although the legal title is still held by the United States.

        </li>
        <li id="t63c02s63-205Bol11b">
         In the income approach, income to be capitalized will be normalized, utilizing the gross domestic product implicit price deflator from the United States department of commerce, bureau of economic analysis, by using an average of at least the previous four (4) years’ net operating incomes and by adjusting each year’s net operating income for unusual nonrecurring items.

      <li id="t63c02s63-205Col11">
       The market value of land actively devoted to agriculture is its actual use value. Actual use value shall be established by capitalization of economic rent or long-term average crop rental at a capitalization rate that shall be either the rate of interest charged by lenders in the local area for agricultural property loans or by the Spokane office of the farm credit system, each averaged over the immediate past five (5) years, whichever is higher, plus the local tax rate.

       “Land actively devoted to agriculture” means that property defined by section 63-604, Idaho Code. For purposes of this section, the act of platting land actively devoted to agriculture does not, in and of itself, cause the land to lose its status as land being actively devoted to agriculture if the land otherwise qualifies for the exemption under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c02s63-205Col13">
       Land actively devoted to agriculture shall not be valued at its speculative value as development property until the use has changed and it is no longer actively devoted to agriculture.

       Rental rates, interest rates, commodity prices, and input prices or other landlord expenses typical to the county of the property being assessed shall be used.

The lien upon any such improvements or timber shall continue after such improvements have been removed or the timber cut from such real property. Such taxes shall be due and collectible immediately upon the commencement of the severance and unless paid upon the demand of the tax collector it shall be the duty of the county attorney to commence an action for the collection of such taxes in the district court of the county in which the property is situated. Such improvements or timber may be levied upon and sold in the same manner as is now provided by law for the sale of real property upon execution, and the county or any taxing unit affected may maintain an action in the proper court for injunction to restrain the removal of any improvements or the cutting or removal of standing timber from any real property against which there are any unpaid property taxes.

        Idaho tax commission was required to first determine if property should be classified as operating property. Then, and only then, could an assessor either petition for a writ of review to dispute the classification or assess the property, if it was non-operating property, depending upon the commission’s definition of operating property. Therefore, a district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a taxpayer in a case where a county assessor assessed property as non-operating after the same property had already been assessed as operating by the commission.

         It shall be the duty of the state tax commission to prepare and distribute to each county assessor and the county commissioners within the state of Idaho, rules prescribing and directing the manner in which market value for assessment purposes is to be determined for the purpose of taxation. The rules promulgated by the state tax commission shall require each assessor to find market value for assessment purposes of all property, except that expressly exempt under chapter 6, title 63, Idaho Code, within his county according to recognized appraisal methods and techniques as set forth by the state tax commission; provided, that the actual and functional use shall be a major consideration when determining market value for assessment purposes.

The state tax commission shall also prepare and distribute amendments and changes to the rules as shall be necessary in order to carry out the intent and purposes of this title. The rules shall be in the form as the commission shall direct, and shall be made available upon request to other public officers and the general public in reasonable quantities without charge. In ascertaining the market value for assessment purposes of any item of property, the assessor of each county shall, and is required to, abide by, adhere to and conform with rules promulgated by the state tax commission.

       The board of county commissioners of any Idaho county declared by the governor of the state of Idaho as a natural disaster area may grant an extension of time for any filings or payments required under section 63-302(1), 63-602G, 63-706 or 63-903, Idaho Code, to those persons whose ability to timely comply with their filing or payment requirement is adversely affected by a natural disaster set forth in the declaration.

        Where a county undertakes to update its initial declarations during the course of the tax year, it cannot increase a taxpayer’s tax burden to reflect the taxpayer’s acquisition of nonexempt property without decreasing that tax burden to reflect the fact that property reported by the taxpayer in an earlier declaration was no longer subject to the county’s ad valorem tax.

       <p>
        Although different types of property are by their nature more amenable to valuation by one method of appraisal than another, the touchstone in the appraisal of property for ad valorem tax purposes is the fair market value of that property; and fair market value must result from application of the chosen appraisal method.

        Where the county board of equalization reviewed the assessment of a real property interest at its December meeting, at which it was empowered to review assessments of personal property only, and not at the June and July meetings at which it was empowered to equalize assessments of real property or hear complaints in regard thereto, the assessment was improper since the owners of an interest in the real property were not afforded an opportunity to register their complaints that the property was improperly included upon the personal property roll.

       </p>
       <p>
        The tax assessor’s practice of using multipliers to correct the 1965 assessment and to reach the result of approaching full cash value on the average throughout the county, based on his examination of at least three to five of the 850 subdivisions in the county and in some cases as many as forty sales in approximately 300 subdivisions, and not based on tax commission’s study of sales of real estate in various subdivisions pertaining to 440 residential properties, the amount of deviation between two studies, being very small, was reasonably accurate.

       The assessor shall leave at the office, place of business or residence of each personal property owner, or mail to such personal property owner at his last known post office address, a form with notice requiring such personal property owner to make a correct list of taxable personal property. Every personal property owner so required shall enter a true and correct statement of such personal property and the ownership thereof, which statement shall be signed and verified by the oath of the personal property owner or his agent listing such personal property, and shall be delivered to the assessor, not later than March 15. The assessor shall thereupon determine the market value for assessment purposes of such personal property and enter the same on the property roll. However, if for any reason the assessor shall fail to contact such personal property owner, the failure shall not impair or invalidate any assessment, nor will such failure relieve the personal property owner or his agent of the responsibility to obtain such declaration and to comply with the requirements of this title. Any willful failure to personally contact each personal property owner, shall be deemed malfeasance in office and grounds for the removal of the assessor from office.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c03s63-302ol12">
       If such person fails to make and deliver the list as required, the assessor may list and assess such personal property according to his best judgment and information.

      <li id="t63c03s63-302ol13">
       Whenever a taxpayer’s list of taxable personal property discloses personal property having a situs for purposes of taxation in another county in this state, the assessor must immediately make a copy of that portion of such list for each county in which such personal property is situated, and transmit the same by mail to the assessor of the proper county, who must, upon receipt of such copy, enter such personal property upon the property roll therein, unless such personal property has already been entered. The assessor shall strike from the original list all personal property so disclosed as having a situs in another county, and shall assess and enter only the balance of the personal property in his county.

        This section was intended to benefit buyers of mobile homes, not burden their financiers; it provides a method for a mobile home purchaser to legally bind himself to treat his mobile home as real property. Such a filing is to protect a lender by forcing a borrower to commit himself, rather than to protect the mobile home purchaser from a lender who would otherwise provide long-term financing.

       Once a manufactured home has been converted to real property under the provisions of section 63-304, Idaho Code, it shall be deemed a fixture and an improvement to the real property to which it is affixed. Physical removal shall be prohibited without the consent of all persons or entities who, at the time of removal have an interest in the real property or title to any estate in the real property to which the manufactured home has been affixed. The homeowner shall obtain a title report from a title insurance company which shall establish the identity of those individuals or entities whose consent must be obtained. Consent to removal of the manufactured home shall not be required from the owners of rights-of-way, easements or owners of subsurface rights.

       At least thirty (30) days before the manufactured home is to be removed, the homeowner shall give written notice of the intended removal to the county assessor in the county in which the real property is located. The county assessor shall require written evidence that the necessary consents have been obtained from those persons or entities identified in the title report as required in the provisions of subsection (1) of this section. In addition, removal shall be prohibited until the county tax collector has given written approval for the removal of the manufactured home by certifying that all property taxes, due and payable, have been paid.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c03s63-305ol14">
       The homeowner shall, within five (5) days of removal, make application for the issuance of a certificate of title for the manufactured home. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of title, the declaration of reversal shall be recorded. Immediately upon issuance of a certificate of title, the manufactured home shall again become personal property for the purpose of financing and for the purpose of taxation shall be assessed pursuant to section 63-302, Idaho Code.

        Where land in Idaho owned by the United States government in trust for certain Indian allottees was leased by the United States to plaintiff for 25 years with an option to renew for an additional 25 years, and plaintiff built a potato storage warehouse on the land with a useful life of 50 to 75 years with the ownership of the warehouse, by the terms of the lease, to be in the United States, but the use thereof to belong to plaintiff for the duration of the lease; plaintiff was not obliged to pay Idaho ad valorem taxes on the warehouse since it was owned by the United States and therefore exempt from such taxation, and no Idaho statute provided for taxation of plaintiff’s possessory interest in the premises.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t63c03s63-314ol11">
       It shall be the duty of the county assessor of each county in the state to conduct and carry out a continuing program of valuation of all taxable properties under his jurisdiction pursuant to such rules as the state tax commission may prescribe, to the end that all parcels of property under the assessor’s jurisdiction are assessed at current market value. In order to promote uniform assessment of property in the state of Idaho, taxable property shall be appraised or indexed annually to reflect current market value. In order to achieve this goal, all taxable property in a county shall be appraised at least once every five (5) years, except as provided in subsection (6). Beginning in 2003, or year one (1) of any five (5) year cycle not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the taxable properties in the county shall be appraised during that year; by the end of year two (2) not less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the taxable properties in the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous year; by the end of year three (3) not less than fifty-five percent (55%) of the taxable properties in the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous two (2) years; by the end of year four (4) not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the taxable properties in the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous three (3) years; and by the end of year five (5) all one hundred percent (100%) of the taxable properties within the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous four (4) years. Annually, all taxable property, not appraised that year, shall be indexed to reflect current market value for assessment purposes using market value property transactions and results of the annual appraisal of taxable property. The county assessor shall maintain in the respective offices sufficient records to show when each parcel or item of property was last appraised. The appraisal required by this section shall include a plan outlining the continuing valuation program. Said plan shall be submitted to the state tax commission for approval on or before the first Monday in February, 1997, and no less frequently than every fifth year thereafter. The state tax commission shall not approve any plan that fails to provide for adequate appraisal and valuation of all taxable properties in any county.

       The state tax commission is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to promulgate rules for the implementation of this program, and to provide any such county assessor with such supervision and technical assistance as may be necessary.

       The county commissioners of each county shall furnish the assessor with such additional funds and personnel as may be required to carry out the program hereby provided, and for this purpose may levy annually a property tax of not to exceed four-hundredths percent (.04%) of the market value for assessment purposes on all taxable property in the county to be collected and paid into the county treasury and appropriated to the property valuation fund which is hereby created.
    (4) If compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) is not obtained, or if any county fails to meet the goals set in subsection (1), the state tax commission may proceed as required by section 63-316, Idaho Code. If a county fails to meet the timelines in subsection (1), the state tax commission shall require a remediation plan.

       As used in this section the term “adequate appraisal and valuation of all taxable properties in any county” means a process which includes a field inspection of not less than the number of taxable properties necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (1). Appraisal also includes collection, verification and analysis of market value sales, applicable income and expense data and building cost information, and application of this information to predict market value.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c03s63-314ol16">
       The board of county commissioners may request that the Idaho state tax commission grant an extension of the five (5) year reappraisal deadline set forth in subsection (1). The request shall be in writing and shall set forth the reason(s) that the county is unable to complete the reappraisal process as required by subsection (1) and shall set forth the measures the county will undertake in order to complete the reappraisal program within the extension of time requested. In no case shall an extension exceed two (2) years. The state tax commission may approve or deny any request for an extension and shall notify the board of county commissioners of its decision in writing. The state tax commission shall not approve any extension absent a showing by the county of extraordinary circumstances. Extraordinary circumstances may include, but are not limited to, natural disasters or unforeseen circumstances that result in extreme financial hardship to the county. Circumstances that will not qualify for an extension may include, but are not limited to, failure to adequately fund the county valuation program as provided by this section, malfeasance, or mismanagement by a current elected official. The state tax commission shall not grant the extension provided in this section if studies conducted by the commission indicate that any category of property affected by such extension is not assessed at market value.

       The provisions of this section shall apply only to charter districts levying a maintenance and operation levy in the prior calendar year. For the purpose of this section, adjusted market value for assessment purposes shall be the adjusted market value for assessment purposes of all property assessed for property tax purposes for the year referred to in sections 33-802 and 33-1002, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c03s63-315ol12">
       The state tax commission shall conduct a ratio study to annually ascertain the ratio between the assessed value and the market value for assessment purposes of all property assessed for property tax purposes. Said ratio study shall be conducted in accordance with nationally accepted procedures. From the ratio so ascertained the state tax commission shall compute the adjusted market value of all property assessed for property tax purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c03s63-315ol13">
       The ratio shall be computed in each school district and applied to the market value for assessment purposes within each school district.

       Sales used in determining the ratio required by this section shall be arm’s length, market value property sales occurring in the year beginning on October 1 of the year preceding the year for which the adjusted market value is to be determined. The state tax commission may, at its discretion, modify the sales period when doing so produces provably better representativeness of the actual ratio in any school district. The state tax commission may also add independently conducted appraisals when the state tax commission believes that this procedure will improve the representativeness and reliability of the ratio.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c03s63-315ol15">
       Whenever the state tax commission is unable to determine with reasonable statistical certainty that the assessed value within any school district differs from the market value for assessment purposes, the state tax commission may certify the assessed value to be the adjusted market value of any school district.

       The state tax commission shall certify the adjusted market value of each school district to the state department of education and each county auditor no later than the first Monday in April each year. The state tax commission shall prepare a report indicating procedures used in computing the adjusted market value and showing statistical measures computed in the ratio study.

        The state board of equalization (now state tax commission) is clothed by statute with authority to assess certain classes and kinds of property, and it has a right to exercise a fair discretion in expressing its judgment as to the valuation of such property; when it has acted and there is no fraud shown in its judgment, its action is not subject to review.

       <p>
        This section is not unconstitutional because it provides a different tax treatment of the operating property of electric public utilities, as contrasted with the tax treatment of the operating property of all other utilities and railroads. School Dist. No. 25 v. State Tax Comm’n, 101 Idaho 283, 612 P.2d 126 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although each county throughout the state is entitled to tax the assessed value of the operating property of electric utilities located within that county’s boundaries, the fact that one county may have a larger or smaller amount of such operating property within its borders as contrasted with some other county does not render this section violative of the constitution. School Dist. No. 25 v. State Tax Comm’n, 101 Idaho 283, 612 P.2d 126 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The classifications created in this section, i.e., electric utilities as contrasted with all other utilities and railroads, are nonsuspect; therefore, such classification will withstand an equal protection challenge if there is any conceivable state of facts which will support it. School Dist. No. 25 v. State Tax Comm’n, 101 Idaho 283, 612 P.2d 126 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that the amount of taxable operating property located within the state differs from one county to another does not render this section constitutionally prohibited “local” legislation; further, this section is not “special” in nature, thereby rendering it violative of Idaho Const., Art. III, § 19. School Dist. No. 25 v. State Tax Comm’n, 101 Idaho 283, 612 P.2d 126 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The uniformity clause of Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 5 only requires that the tax rate shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax; hence, the fact that, under the provisions of this section, the “value per mile” of operating property of an electric utility will differ as between various taxing districts does not render the statute violative of Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 5. School Dist. No. 25 v. State Tax Comm’n, 101 Idaho 283, 612 P.2d 126 (1980).

        Board of equalization (now state tax commission) should determine assessed valuation of electric current transmission lines and operating companies by counties instead of by state as a whole, and each county should collect taxes upon assessed valuation of property within its territorial limits but said board has no power to apportion valuations to the different counties of state as its function ends with determining total value of electric company within county and total mileage of its lines.

The appeal may be based upon any issue presented by the taxpayer to the state tax commission and shall be heard by the district court in a trial de novo without a jury in the same manner as though it were an original proceeding in that court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to suspend the payment of taxes pending appeal. Payment of taxes while an appeal hereunder is pending shall not operate to waive the right to an appeal. Any final order of the district court under this section shall be subject to appeal to the Idaho supreme court in the manner provided by the Idaho appellate rules.

      <li id="t63c04s63-409ol12">
       In any appeal taken pursuant to this section, the burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking affirmative relief to establish that the valuation from which the appeal is taken is erroneous, or that the state tax commission erred in its decision regarding a claim that certain property is exempt from taxation, the value thereof, or any other relief sought before the state tax commission. A preponderance of the evidence shall suffice to sustain the burden of proof. The burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking affirmative relief and the burden of going forward with the evidence shall shift as in other civil litigation. The district court shall render its decision in writing, including therein a concise statement of the facts found by the court and the conclusions of law reached by the court. The court may affirm, reverse, modify, or remand any order of the state tax commission, and shall grant other relief, invoke such other remedies and issue such orders, in accordance with its decision, as appropriate.

        Idaho tax commission was required to first determine if property should be classified as operating property. Then, and only then, could an assessor either petition for a writ of review to dispute the classification or assess the property, if it was non-operating property, depending upon the commission’s definition of operating property. Therefore, a district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a taxpayer in a case where a county assessor assessed property as non-operating after the same property had already been assessed as operating by the commission. Union Pac. Land Res. Corp. v. Shoshone County Assessor, 140 Idaho 528, 96 P.3d 629 (2004).
    Proper standard of review in an appeal from a district court’s trial de novo of a decision of the Idaho tax commission is substantial evidence, and not on the record of the agency action. Idaho Power Co. v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 141 Idaho 316, 109 P.3d 170 (2005).

        District court did not err in finding that the corporation proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the Idaho state tax commission’s valuation of its taxable operating property in Idaho was erroneous; the district court did not err in finding that the corporation’s expert’s appraisal was reliable. Pacificorp v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 153 Idaho 759, 291 P.3d 442 (2012).

      The function of the board of equalization shall be confined strictly to assuring that the market value for assessment purposes of property has been found by the assessor, and to the functions provided for in chapter 6, title 63, Idaho Code, relating to exemptions from taxation. It is hereby made the duty of the board of equalization to enforce and compel a proper classification and assessment of all property required under the provisions of this title to be entered on the property rolls, and in so doing, the board of equalization shall examine the rolls and shall raise or cause to be raised, or lower or cause to be lowered, the assessment of any property which in the judgment of the board has not been properly assessed. The board of equalization must examine and act upon all complaints filed with the board in regard to the assessed value of any property entered on the property rolls and must correct any assessment improperly made. The taxpayer shall have the burden of proof in seeking affirmative relief to establish that the determination of the assessor is erroneous, including any determination of assessed value. A preponderance of the evidence shall suffice to sustain the burden of proof.

        A county assessor should make such changes upon the assessment roll of his county as the board of equalization for his county has ordered relative to the assessment of an individual taxpayer. Murphy v. Board of Comm’rs, 6 Idaho 745, 59 P. 715 (1899).

        Duty of Board.
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is the duty of the board of equalization to order the assessor to assess any property which has escaped assessment, and where such assessment is made before the final adjournment of the session of the board convened, the taxpayer has his opportunity of being heard and such assessment is not void for want of notice or opportunity to be heard thereon. Inland Lumber & Timber Co. v. Thompson, 11 Idaho 508, 83 P. 933 (1905).
    It was the duty of the county board of equalization to determine whether assessments had been made on full cash value and on equal bases throughout the county, and where property had been under or over assessed as compared with other assessments, and its assessment was above or below full cash value, the board was required to bring it in line with other property.

        Where the board of equalization has made an order proposing a raise on the valuation of any specific property, and the person against whom such property is assessed thereafter appears at the time and place fixed for the hearing on such proposed change and protests against the same and submits his evidence, he thereby waives the service of notice and cannot be heard to object to the action because notice was not served.

        S.L. 1891 did not authorize the state board of equalization to raise or diminish the valuation put upon any class or classes of property, nor to fix the valuation of any class of property, but it could raise or diminish the aggregate valuation of the property of any county by such percentage as justice required.

      Taxes upon personal property, where the owners of such personal property are owners of real property in the county, which have not been paid on or before the second Monday of October, and which the board of county commissioners finds to be a lien upon the real property, may be certified to the county auditor and the tax collector.

      The board of equalization must, before taking final action in equalizing the assessed value of the property of any person refusing to appear and testify, or in increasing the assessed value of any property, notify the owner thereof, or his agent or representative, of its intention to do so, and require such person to appear forthwith before the board and make objection, if he has any. The board may direct the notice to be served personally upon the owner, or his agent or representative; or, it may direct the clerk to serve the notice by mail, addressed to such owner, or his agent or representative, at his last known post office address. In the case of service by mail, the board of equalization shall not take final action until ten (10) working days after the mailing of such notice, unless the owner, or his agent, or representative, shall sooner appear. If the owner is one other than the equitable titleholder, such as an escrowee, trustee of trust deed or other third party, the owner shall, within ten (10) days, deliver to the equitable titleholder a true copy of the notice from the board of equalization.

        When respondent’s predecessor in interest failed to appear before the board of equalization while it was in session in 1952 to protest the assessment of taxes, he waived or forfeited his right to thereafter challenge the assessment or the taxes levied thereon on the ground that the assessment was unequal and excessive; likewise with respect to the assessments made and the taxes levied for the years 1953 and 1954. Administrative remedies provided by the legislature for unequal assessment of property must be pursued by the taxpayer as a condition precedent to judicial action.

       Any time within thirty (30) days after mailing of notice of a decision of the board of equalization, or pronouncement of a decision announced at a hearing, an appeal of any act, order or proceeding of the board of equalization, or the failure of the board of equalization to act may be taken to the board of tax appeals. Such appeal may only be filed by the property owner, the assessor, the state tax commission or by a person aggrieved when he deems such action illegal or prejudicial to the public interest. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to suspend the payment of property taxes pending said appeal.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c05s63-511ol12">
       Notice of such appeal stating the grounds therefor shall be filed with the county auditor, who shall forthwith transmit to the board of tax appeals a copy of said notice, together with a certified copy of the minutes of the proceedings of the board of equalization resulting in such act, order or proceeding, or a certificate to be furnished by the clerk of the board that said board of equalization has failed to act in the time required by law on any complaint, protest, objection, application or petition in regard to assessment of the complainant’s property, or a petition of the state tax commission. The county auditor shall also forthwith transmit all evidence taken in connection with the matter appealed. The county auditor shall submit all such appeals to the board of tax appeals within thirty (30) days of being notified of the appeal. The board of tax appeals may receive further evidence and will hear the appeal as provided in chapter 38, title 63, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c05s63-511ol13">
       Any appeal that may be taken to the board of tax appeals may, during the same time period, be taken to the district court for the county in which the property is located.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c05s63-511ol14">
       In any appeal taken to the board of tax appeals or the district court pursuant to this section, the burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking affirmative relief to establish that the valuation from which the appeal is taken is erroneous, or that the board of equalization erred in its decision regarding a claim that certain property is exempt from taxation, the value thereof, or any other relief sought before the board of equalization. A preponderance of the evidence shall suffice to sustain the burden of proof. The burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking affirmative relief and the burden of going forward with the evidence shall shift as in other civil litigation. The board of tax appeals or the district court shall render its decision in writing, including therein a concise statement of the facts found by the court and the conclusions of law reached by the court. The board of tax appeals or the court may affirm, reverse, modify or remand any order of the board of equalization, and shall grant other relief, invoke such other remedies, and issue such orders in accordance with its decision, as appropriate.

There was no reversible error, however, in also citing the clear and convincing standard, because the district court’s order showed that the evidence failed to even meet the lower burden of proof.

        Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In routine tax assessment complaints, the pursuit of statutory administrative remedies is a condition precedent to judicial review; however, the rule that administrative remedies must be exhausted before the district court will hear a case is a general rule and has been deviated from in some cases. Fairway Dev. Co. v. Bannock County, 119 Idaho 121, 804 P.2d 294 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exceptions to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine did not apply where the issue was the correctness of tax assessments. In such a case the district court does not acquire subject matter jurisdiction until all the administrative remedies have been exhausted. Fairway Dev. Co. v. Bannock County, 119 Idaho 121, 804 P.2d 294 (1990).

       <p>
        Suit by title company to enjoin collection of ad valorem tax on the ground that it was exempt from ad valorem tax by virtue of payment of premium tax was proper, since it was not a proceeding for equalization of a valid tax levied but a proceeding challenging a void tax against which equity can grant relief by means of an injunction. Security Abstract & Title Co. v. Leonardson, 74 Idaho 528, 264 P.2d 1027 (1953). Power of District Court.

       <p>
        District court may affirm, reverse, or modify order appealed from. First Nat’l Bank v. Board of County Comm’rs, 40 Idaho 391, 232 P. 905 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the action taken was by the county board of equalization, as the minutes recite, then the district court would not acquire jurisdiction on appeal, since the statute provides that appeals from the county board of equalization are to be taken to the state tax commission. In re Felton’s Petition, 79 Idaho 325, 316 P.2d 1064 (1957).

        Statutory Remedy Exclusive.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A taxpayer who did not complain before the board of equalization of the county with reference to the 1936 assessment and who did not appeal from an adverse decision of the board to the taxpayer’s complaint as to 1940 assessment could not maintain an action in court for the recovery of taxes paid under protest. Washburn-Wilson Seed Co. v. Jerome County, 65 Idaho 1, 138 P.2d 978 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a tax is not void ab initio and the legislature has empowered administrative board to determine questions with right of appeal to the courts from the board’s decision, such remedy is exclusive. Washburn-Wilson Seed Co. v. Jerome County, 65 Idaho 1, 138 P.2d 978 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory remedy afforded to an aggrieved taxpayer is exclusive, and a taxpayer may not maintain an action against a county for a general money judgment for the amount of taxes erroneously exacted, where the tax is not absolutely void. Washburn-Wilson Seed Co. v. Jerome County, 65 Idaho 1, 138 P.2d 978 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where taxpayer alleged excessive assessments on his personal property arising from the assessor’s application of rates different from rates at which other property in the county was assessed, taxpayer’s claim had to be pursued through the statutory administration process provided for in this title prior to his seeking relief in the district court by way of a declaratory judgment or refund. V-1 Oil Co. v. County of Bannock, 97 Idaho 807, 554 P.2d 1304 (1976).

        The board of county commissioners sitting as a board of equalization and the district court on appeal from their action are not considered as assessing the property, but only as equalizing the assessment. McGoldrick Lumber Co. v. Benewah County, 54 Idaho 704, 35 P.2d 659 (1934).

       <p>
        An alleged grant of exemption will be strictly construed and, thus, must be in terms so specific and certain as to leave no room for doubt; an exemption cannot be sustained unless it is shown to be within the spirit as well as the letter of the law.

If the value of the part used for commercial purposes is determined to be three percent (3%) or less than the value of the entirety, the whole of said property shall remain exempt. If the value of the part used for commercial purposes is determined to be more than three percent (3%) of the value of the entirety, the assessor shall assess such proportionate part of such building including the value of the real estate as is so leased or used for such purposes, and shall assess the trade fixtures used in connection with the sale of all merchandise; provided however, that the lease or use of any property by any such limited liability company, corporation or society for athletic or recreational facilities, residence halls or dormitories, meeting rooms or halls, auditoriums or club rooms within the purposes for which such limited liability company, corporation or society is organized, shall not be deemed a business or commercial purpose, even though fees or charges be imposed and revenue derived therefrom.

        Determination of an institution’s charitable status is necessarily an individual matter, to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining charitable status of a nonprofit corporation under this section, a number of factors must be considered: (1) the stated purposes of its undertaking, (2) whether its functions are charitable, (3) whether it is supported by donations, (4) whether the recipients of its services are required to pay for the assistance they receive, (5) whether there is general public benefit, (6) whether the income received produces a profit, (7) to whom the assets would go upon dissolution of the corporation, and (8) whether the “charity” provided is based on need. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        To be classed as charitable, an organization need not provide monetary aid to the needy, but may provide any of a number of services of public benefit; the word “charitable,” in a legal sense, includes every gift for general public use, whether it be for educational, religious, physical or social benefit. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        An institution may be entitled to an exemption where it performs a function which might otherwise be an obligation of government and, thus, a nonprofit corporation may benefit only a limited group of people and still be considered “charitable” if that group of people possess a need which government might be required to fill; however, where there is no assistance to individuals which might normally require governmental funds, the institution must meet a stricter test: it must provide benefits to the community at large. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination of a corporation’s charitable status for the purposes of this section must be made on a case-by-case basis; it necessarily involves consideration of the particular circumstances of the organization seeking such status, and it is not susceptible of the application of hard and fast rules or definitions. Coeur d’Alene Pub. Golf Club, Inc. v. Kootenai Bd. of Equalization, 106 Idaho 104, 675 P.2d 819 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no bar to an organization’s classification as charitable that the public benefit it provides is primarily recreational; public recreational facilities serve community social and physical needs, as well as providing some educational benefits. Coeur d’Alene Pub. Golf Club, Inc. v. Kootenai Bd. of Equalization, 106 Idaho 104, 675 P.2d 819 (1984).

        For a corporation’s uses to be considered charitable it is essential that they provide some sort of general public benefit. Coeur d’Alene Pub. Golf Club, Inc. v. Kootenai Bd. of Equalization, 106 Idaho 104, 675 P.2d 819 (1984).

        Not every nonprofit organization that provides some service to the public is entitled to claim that its property is exempt from taxation. Bogus Basin Recreational Ass’n v. Boise County Bd. of Equalization, 119 Idaho 126, 799 P.2d 974 (1990).

       <p>
        Providing homes and services for the elderly at a cost which can be met by them, and providing affordable housing and medical care which meets the special needs of the elderly in a nonprofit setting is generally considered to be a charitable purpose; however, this section not only requires that the organization be established as a charitable institution, but also that the property claimed as exempt must be used exclusively for charitable purposes. In re Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Soc’y (Good Samaritan Village) v. Board of Equalization, 119 Idaho 126, 804 P.2d 299 (1990).
    Nonprofit corporation that provided low income housing to elderly and disabled clients did not perform a function which might otherwise have been an obligation of the government, since the housing it provided was supported by federal tax dollars, not private donations; as such, it merely shifted the burden from one group of taxpayers to another and did not qualify as a charitable organization pursuant to former similar section.

        Although a society of a type contemplated under this section claimed that the independent living complex of its retirement center provided a charitable function in the community because it brought further growth and development to the area, this was an incidental benefit; the charitable nature of the society did not foster the growth, and it is well established that an incidental benefit bestowed upon a community does not constitute a public benefit for tax exemption purposes.

       <p>
        Activities of residential retirement center — the uses to which its property is devoted — which were designed to fulfill its residents’ needs for recreation, society, culture, security, etc. would be, if other factors were present, “charitable” within the scope of this section. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the factors most frequently looked at in determining if a retirement center is a charitable corporation is the amount of fees required of the residents; an institution may still qualify for a tax exemption even if fees are taken from residents to help cover operating expenses, but such fees must usually be nominal or not commensurate with the benefits provided. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where retirement center charged its residents fees sufficient to cover all of its current operating expenses, as well as to retire the debt on all of its facilities, it was difficult to view such an arrangement as charitable, and while such arrangement was not determinative of noncharitable status, it was a factor of great importance and should be weighted accordingly. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where residents of retirement center were required to pay completely for the benefits they received, and to be physically able to care for themselves, they were not a group of persons for whom any government assistance would be needed and where the benefits available at the center were reserved for the restricted group of persons who met the entrance qualifications, it could not be said that the center provided a general benefit to the community; moreover, although the center did not operate at a profit, and its articles of incorporation provided that upon dissolution the corporation’s assets would be distributed to nonprofit corporations or institutions, these factors were not sufficient to establish charitable status and the center was not a “charitable corporation” under this section. Canyon County v. Sunny Ridge Manor, Inc., 106 Idaho 98, 675 P.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for retirement village to be allowed a tax exemption, the exclusive use of the property must provide some gift or service of public benefit. If the independent living units do not meet the needs of the elderly residents, or if the cost of living in the independent living units is not affordable for those elderly who need the services, then there is no public gift or benefit as contemplated by the statutes. If the only elderly persons residing in the facility are those who can afford to pay the founder’s fee or the monthly maintenance fees that are comparable to profit oriented commercial retirement housing in the same community the organization is not entitled to tax exempt status. In re Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Soc’y (Good Samaritan Village) v. Board of Equalization, 119 Idaho 126, 804 P.2d 299 (1990).

       For the purposes of this section, “hospital” means a hospital as defined by chapter 13, title 39, Idaho Code, and includes one (1) or more acute care, outreach, satellite, outpatient, ancillary or support facilities of such hospital whether or not any such individual facility would independently satisfy the definition of hospital.

All improvements to and construction on the real property, while it is being prepared for use as a hospital, shall be exempt from taxation. For purposes of this section, property is being “prepared for use as a hospital” if the corporation has begun construction of a hospital project as evidenced by obtaining a building permit that will, on completion, qualify such property for an exemption and, as of the assessment date, has not abandoned the construction. Construction shall not be considered abandoned if it has been delayed by causes and circumstances beyond the corporation’s control or when delay is caused by an event that has occurred in the absence of the corporation’s willful neglect or intentional acts, omissions or practices engaged in by the corporation for the purpose of impeding progress. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall improvements to property that is being prepared for use as a hospital qualify for an exemption from ad valorem property tax under this subsection for more than three (3) consecutive tax years; upon completion of construction and obtaining a certificate of occupancy, the entire real property shall be exempt from taxation if the corporation meets the requirements of subsection (4) of this section; provided, property already exempt or eligible for exemption shall not be affected by the provisions of this subsection.

       If a hospital corporation uses property for business purposes from which a revenue is derived that is not directly related to the hospital corporation’s exempt purposes, then the property shall be assessed and taxed as any other property. If property is used in part by a hospital corporation for such purposes, then the assessor shall determine the value of the entire property and the value of the part used that is not directly related to the hospital corporation’s exempt purposes. If the value of the part that is not directly related to the hospital corporation’s exempt purposes is determined to be three percent (3%) or less than the value of the entire property, then the property shall remain exempt. If the value of the part that is not directly related to the hospital corporation’s exempt purposes is determined to be more than three percent (3%) of the value of the entire property, then the assessor shall assess the proportionate part of the property, including the value of the real estate used for such purposes.
    (7) A hospital corporation issued an exemption from property taxation pursuant to this section and operating a hospital having one hundred fifty (150) or more patient beds shall prepare a community benefits report to be filed with the board of equalization by December 31 of each year. The report shall itemize the hospital’s amount of unreimbursed services for the prior year (including charity care, bad debt, and underreimbursed care covered through government programs); special services and programs the hospital provides below its actual cost; donated time, funds, subsidies and in-kind services; additions to capital such as physical plant and equipment; and indication of the process the hospital has used to determine general community needs that coincide with the hospital’s mission. The report shall be provided as a matter of community information.

        Considering that tax exemptions are construed strictly against the taxpayer, the definition of hospital requires it be more than an institution which provides housing and minimal medical care for those who are ambulatory and otherwise able to care for themselves; independent living units used primarily to provide housing for aged or elderly persons in a retirement community or village did not qualify as a tax exempt hospital. Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Soc’y (Good Samaritan Village) v. Board of Equalization, 119 Idaho 126, 804 P.2d 299 (1990).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In order for retirement village to be allowed a tax exemption, the exclusive use of the property must provide some gift or service of public benefit. If the independent living units do not meet the needs of the elderly residents, or if the cost of living in the independent living units is not affordable for those elderly who need the services, then there is no public gift or benefit as contemplated by the statutes. If the only elderly persons residing in the facility are those who can afford to pay the founder’s fee or the monthly maintenance fees that are comparable to profit oriented commercial retirement housing in the same community the organization is not entitled to tax exempt status. Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Soc’y (Good Samaritan Village) v. Board of Equalization, 119 Idaho 126, 804 P.2d 299 (1990).

        Homeowners are not a suspect class and the exemption under this section for homeowners furthers legitimate state interests, such as fostering home ownership and equalizing the tax burden between residential and business properties; therefore, this section does not violate the equal protection provisions of<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. I,</cite> § 2 or the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Simmons v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 111 Idaho 343, 723 P.2d 887 (1986).

       <p>
        The provision of Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 5 which expressly authorizes “such exemptions from taxation as from time to time shall seem necessary and just . . .” does not mean that property may be wholly, but not partially, exempt; therefore, the partial exemption under this section of owner-occupied residential improvements does not violate Idaho Const., Art. VII, §§ 2 or 5. Simmons v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 111 Idaho 343, 723 P.2d 887 (1986).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The following property is exempt from property taxation: business inventory. For the purpose of this section, “business inventory” means all items of tangible personal property or other property, including site improvements, described as:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t63c06s63-602Wol11">

       All nursery stock, stock-in-trade, merchandise, products, finished or partly finished goods, raw materials, and all forest products subject to the provisions of chapter 17, title 63, Idaho Code, supplies, containers and other personal property that is held for sale or consumption in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s manufacturing, farming, wholesale jobbing, or merchandising business.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c06s63-602Wol13">
       Residential improvements never occupied. Once residential improvements are occupied as defined in section 63-317, Idaho Code, they shall be subject to the tax provided by section 63-317, Idaho Code. The provisions of section 63-602Y, Idaho Code, shall not apply to the exemption provided by this subsection. The exemption provided by this subsection applies only to improvements to real property, and only until first occupied. For purposes of this section, the term “residential improvements” means only:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t63c06s63-602Wol13a">
         Single family residences; or
        </li>

         Residential condominium units.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The nonresidential portion of an improvement to real property that is used or is to be used for residential and nonresidential purposes does not qualify for the exemption provided by this section. If an improvement contains multiple residential units, each such unit shall lose the exemption provided in this section when it becomes occupied.

       (4) Site improvements that are associated with land, such as roads and utilities, on real property held by the land developer, either as owner or vendee in possession under a land sale contract, for sale or consumption in the ordinary course of the land developer’s business until other improvements, such as buildings or structural components of buildings, are begun or the real property is conveyed to a third party. For purposes of this subsection, a transfer of title to real property to a legal entity of which at least fifty percent (50%) is owned by the land developer, the land developer’s original entity or the same principals who owned the land developer’s original entity shall not be considered a conveyance to a third party. For purposes of this subsection, the amount of the exemption shall be the difference between the market value of the land with site improvements and the market value of the land without site improvements as shall be determined by a comparative market analysis of a similarly situated parcel or parcels of real property that have not been improved with such site improvements contemplated by this subsection. In the case the market value of land without site improvements cannot be reasonably assessed because of the absence of comparable sales, an exemption value of seventy-five percent (75%) of the market value of land with site improvements shall be granted to that parcel. An application is required for the exemption provided in this subsection in the first year the exemption is claimed; in subsequent consecutive years no new application is required. The application must be made to the board of county commissioners by April 15 and the taxpayer and county assessor must be notified of any decision and assessment of property by May 15. The decision or assessment of property, or both, of the board of county commissioners may be appealed to the county board of equalization no later than the fourth Monday in June. The applicant shall notify the board of county commissioners in writing of any change in eligibility for the parcel by April 15. History.

        It cannot be held that the classification of the property under this section is arbitrary, unreasonable or unjust so as to warrant setting it aside as unconstitutional, as the granting of the exemptions is for the benefit of the economic welfare of the state of Idaho; nor is the classification violative of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

       <p>
        The granting of an exemption from ad valorem taxation of “all livestock, fur-bearing animals, fish, fowl and bees” by exempting business inventory and describing such property as business inventory was to use a fiction, but such exemption is valid, since under Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 5, the legislature had power and authority to grant the exemption in a direct manner, had it wanted to. Leonardson v. Moon, 92 Idaho 796, 451 P.2d 542 (1969).

       The following property is exempt from taxation: real and personal property which has been damaged by an event causing casualty loss to all or a portion of the property. The board of equalization on a case-by-case basis shall determine whether to grant an exemption.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c06s63-602Xol12">
       The county board of equalization shall decide whether to grant such claim for exemption on or before the second Monday of July of the year in which the claim is filed. If granted, either in whole or in part, the county board of equalization shall order all necessary adjustments made in the property roll.
      </li>

     <p>
      An exemption granted under this section shall be for the year in which the real or personal property has been damaged or destroyed. Claimants seeking exemption under this section must apply to the county board of equalization. The application must be in writing on a form provided by the county and must identify the claimant, the date of the casualty loss, and the property that has been damaged or destroyed. The application must be filed on or before the end of the county’s normal business hours on the fourth Monday of June of the year in which the casualty loss occurred. If an exemption is granted, the value of the property subject to taxation shall be calculated by dividing the number of days in the year prior to the casualty loss by the number of days in the year and multiplying the resulting quotient by the market value of the property less any applicable exemptions, as of 12:01 a.m. on the first day of January of the tax year.

     <p>
      (b) Tenants shall not be evicted based upon their inability to pay for a period of three (3) months if such inability is due to a catastrophic event that is not under the tenant’s control. For purposes of this subsection, “catastrophic event” means a medical condition or injury in which sudden, serious and unexpected symptoms of illness or injury are sufficiently severe to render the tenant unable to participate in employment and such illness or injury has been certified by one (1) or more licensed physicians and/or psychiatrists or psychologists.

     <p>
      (b) If the property is receiving federal project-based assistance, as provided by 42 U.S.C. sections 1437f(d)(2), 1437f(f)(6) and 1437f(o)(13); or
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) To any property used by a taxpayer to qualify for tax credits under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. chapter 42 or any successor programs until such time as the property is solely owned by a nonprofit organization as defined in this section and is no longer utilized to receive federal tax credits.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a low-income housing property shall be exempt from taxation due to undue hardship if:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) The property was financed prior to the effective date of this act; and

The legislative intent behind the agricultural exemption was that “use” is a requirement and, therefore, the property owners were not entitled to the exemption with respect to use of the land for grazing purposes.

A person holding either partial title in fee simple or holding a certificate of motor vehicle title together with another person, but who does not occupy the dwelling as his primary dwelling place, shall not be considered an owner for purposes of this section, if such person is a cosignatory of a note secured by the dwelling in question and at least one (1) of the other cosignatories of the note occupies the dwelling as his primary dwelling place. The combined community property interests of both spouses shall not be considered partial ownership as long as the combined community property interests constitute the entire ownership of the homestead, including where the spouses are occupying a homestead owned by an entity, as set forth in this subsection, and the spouses have the primary right of occupancy of the homestead. The proportional reduction required under this subsection shall not apply to community property interests. Where title to property was held by a person who has died without timely filing a claim for property tax reduction, the estate of the deceased person shall be the “owner,” provided that the time periods during which the deceased person held such title shall be attributed to the estate for the computation of any time periods under subsection (8) (a) or (b) of this section.

The commissioners may, at their discretion, cancel taxes on property which has been damaged by an event causing casualty loss to all or a portion of the property when the event occurs after the fourth Monday of June or casualty losses for which the amount of loss cannot be determined until after the fourth Monday of June.

       Applicants seeking a cancellation pursuant to this section must apply to the county commissioners. Each applicant shall give a sworn statement containing full and complete information of his financial status to the county commissioners and shall make true answers to all questions put before him touching such person’s right to the cancellation. The county commissioners shall decide and determine from each examination and from each written application for said cancellation whether or not such person is entitled to the cancellation claimed or any part thereof accordingly. In applying for a cancellation pursuant to this section, an applicant may submit an application at any time and the county commissioners may grant such application, either in whole or in part, at any regular meeting and the burden of proving the right of such cancellation shall rest upon the applicant.

Such appeal may only be filed by the property owner or by any person aggrieved, or by a person or entity acting on behalf of such person, when he deems any such action illegal or prejudicial to the public interest. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to suspend the payment of property taxes pending said appeal.

        In the county school emergency fund statutes the levy provided is authorized in order to provide funds with which to defray unanticipated expense of educational and transportation programs brought about by reason of increase in pupil attendance.

        The levy for the county school emergency fund is a county tax levied equally and uniformly upon all the taxable property in the county. The taxpayers are not assessed as members of a school district but as citizens of the county. The proceeds of the tax levy are apportioned in varying amounts and because some districts receive less than the amount of levy therein does not constitute lack of uniformity where the tax is apportioned reasonably and according to the need in an effort to equalize education or standards throughout the county.

        The statute authorizing the levying of a tax sufficient to provide a county equalization program, not in excess of thirty-five per cent of the state minimum educational program, does not require that the performance of the preliminary steps by the county commissioners and county superintendent of schools be made a matter of record, and if the underlying facts justifying such steps exist, their existence is controlling.

        Where county board of equalization reduced assessor’s assessment of cattle in county by 10% on July 13, but state tax commission on second Monday in August reinstated prior assessment of assessor, and county officers by order of board of county commissioners on September 14 refused to accept assessment ordered by state tax commission, the latter was entitled to writ of mandamus compelling county officers and county board of equalization to obey order of state tax commission though petition was not filed until December 3, since final determination of true assessment roll rests with state tax commission.

        In collecting municipal taxes under this section, the county officials merely act as the agents of the municipality in the performance of the duties required of them and this relationship of agency equally applies to the method of assessing and collecting taxes for both the chartered cities and the municipalities throughout the state. Hamilton v. McCall, 90 Idaho 253, 409 P.2d 393 (1965).
    Since, according to the tax collection procedures followed in this state, the counties act as a collecting agency in the collection of taxes for the state and municipality, payment of property taxes to the county rather than the municipality itself was sufficient to establish payment of taxes as required to sustain a claim based on adverse possession pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-210" target="_blank">§ 5-210</a></cite>.

The penalty for delinquent state and county tax was 6 per cent, which was the rate for delinquent irrigation district assessment. The assessor correctly charged 6 per cent as penalty. Nampa & Meridian Irrigation Dist. v. Barker, 38 Idaho 529, 223 P. 529 (1924).

      To avoid delinquency, total payment must be made in full to the county tax collector by the due date. Any delinquency shall have the force and effect of a sale to the county tax collector as grantee in trust for the county of the property described. Any payment on a delinquency is, in effect, a partial redemption of the property from tax sale. Interest on a delinquency will be charged at one percent (1%) per month calculated from January 1 following the year the tax lien attached, provided however, that the interest shall not be charged on collection costs.

        Affidavit Confers Jurisdiction.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Proper, correct and sufficient affidavit detailing the acts performed is a jurisdictional prerequisite to issuance of a tax deed, and such affidavit must show personal service on party in possession of premises, if there be such. Evans v. Poppie, 51 Idaho 123, 4 P.2d 356 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        The actual existence of the facts required to be shown by the affidavit is the thing which confers jurisdiction. The affidavit is merely the proof that the jurisdictional facts exist, but the failure to make the proof does not do away with the facts which the proof would show. Shail v.

        Because there was no evidence of any notice given whatsoever as required by this section and it was self-evident that the county treasurer was unable to truthfully recite the compliances required under statute, the issuance of the tax deed to county was invalid and the order declaring county to have superior right, title and interest in land must be vacated and title remains with original owner and heirs.

Giacobbi v. Hall, 109 Idaho 293, 707 P.2d 404 (1985).

        Fact that tax deed is made prima facie evidence of title simply shifts burden of proof; it does not deny right to defend title against a tax deed. Wilson v. Locke, 18 Idaho 582, 111 P. 247 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a mortgage foreclosure action, holder of realty mortgage securing a note duly executed and recorded by the owner of the realty who sold the realty had the burden of proof of the vendor’s title to realty against a purchaser who denied the vendor’s title and denied that his purchase of realty was made subject to such mortgage, and introduced a tax deed to realty, executed and delivered to purchaser by irrigation district. Bogart v. Bagley, 65 Idaho 177, 141 P.2d 975 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of the statutes in Idaho relating to tax deeds as evidence is to change the common-law order of proof, and to cast the burden of proof on the person attacking a tax title to affirmatively prove such irregularities or defects in prior proceedings as would overcome the prima facie case made by tax deeds.

       <p>
        A tax deed is prima facie evidence of the facts and things mentioned in it; and to defeat such deed, defendant must show nonexistence of such facts or some of them. Cooperative Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Green, 5 Idaho 660, 51 P. 770 (1897); Armstrong v. Jarron, 21 Idaho 747, 125 P. 170 (1912).

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2016, ch. 273 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify the scope and effect of Idaho’s statutes governing tax deeds. In the case of
    Regan v. Owen
    , the Idaho Supreme Court addressed whether a tax deed issued pursuant to Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, has the effect of extinguishing an otherwise valid private easement across the subject property. Similar legislative language exists with respect to counties in Section 31-808, Idaho Code, with respect to irrigation entities in Section 43-720, Idaho Code, and with respect to cities in Section 50-1823, Idaho Code. The court did not decide the issue, but remanded to a lower court. The lower court subsequently ruled that, despite the harsh result, the statute has this effect. While a private access easement was at issue there, the reasoning would also result in the elimination of public utility easements, ditch rights, public highways and rights-of-way, conservation easements, and all manner of third-party rights in the land including, for example, interests of remaindermen following a life estate. By this legislation, the Idaho Legislature rejects that conclusion. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow local governments to destroy valid property interests held by third parties in land that is subject to a sale or other conveyance based on a tax delinquency, except where notice and opportunity to cure is provided under the statute. Doing so would constitute an uncompensated taking of property under both the Idaho Constitution and the United States Constitution. The Legislature would never have intended such a result and, by this legislation, makes that clear. As its context should have made evident, the purpose of Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, and the other referenced sections, has always been to convey title absolutely free and clear of liens and mortgages of a monetary nature. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow a local governmental entity to convey more than the delinquent taxpayer owned and thereby to destroy valid property interests held by others without notice and an opportunity to cure. This clarification brings the interpretation of Idaho’s tax deed statute into line with the interpretation of similar statutes in other jurisdictions, as had always been the Legislature’s intent.”
    Section 1 of S.L. 2020, ch. 273 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify and confirm the scope and effect of Idaho’s statutes relating to the treatment of delinquent local improvement district assessments certified to the tax collector for collection. Section 50-1715, Idaho Code, permits, as an alternative method of collection to the issuance of delinquent certificates under the Local Improvement District Code, the certification of delinquent assessment installments to the tax collector. Once certified, said assessments are to be extended on the tax rolls and collected as are property taxes. Collection of delinquent property taxes is governed by the provisions of chapter 10, title 63, Idaho Code. By this legislation, the Idaho Legislature seeks to clarify any ambiguity that may exist regarding the treatment and interpretation of delinquent assessments certified to the tax collector pursuant to section 50-1715, Idaho Code, and to confirm the interplay between the Local Improvement District Code and the property tax statutes with respect to any such assessments so certified. It is and has always been the intent of the Legislature that delinquent local improvement district assessments certified to the tax collector for collection be governed by the collection provisions of chapter 10, title 63, Idaho Code, and not the collection provisions of the Local Improvement District Code. As context should have made evident, said delinquent assessments are to be treated in the same manner and to the same effect as delinquent property taxes, including with respect to collection, satisfaction, and extinguishment thereof. The purpose of section 63-1009, Idaho Code, has always been to convey title absolutely free and clear of liens and mortgages of a monetary nature; including, specifically, delinquent local improvement district assessments certified to the tax collector for collection pursuant to section 50-1715, Idaho Code. As with property taxes, a tax deed conveys title to the grantee free and clear of all certified delinquent local improvement district assessments for which the lien is foreclosed and in satisfaction of which the property is sold. It was never the intent of the Legislature for such certified local improvement district assessment amounts to survive the issuance of a tax deed in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of property taxes. Sections 50-1721 and 63-1009, Idaho Code, are being amended to clarify and confirm this intent.”

        When a lender redeemed parcels of land, the parcels returned to the status tyhat they held before the tax delinquency. Thus, a limited liability company’s prior mortgage was senior, and the lender’s later mortgage was junior. The tax lien ceased to exist when the county issued itself a tax deed for the parcels, and the county did not possess a general lien against the lender’s parcels when the lender redeemed and held absolute title to the land as described in its tax deed.

        A lender’s redemption deed did not subordinate it to the county’s right, title, claim, and interest based on a tax deed, because the redemption deed conveyed no fee title ownership. Rather, the county’s absolute ownership of the property through the tax deed was terminated, not conveyed, and the property was returned to the status quo among all lien holders.

The warrant shall also describe generally the personal property upon which the delinquency exists and give the amount of each delinquency. The warrant shall contain a direction to the county sheriff to seize and sell a sufficient amount of the property, or any other personal property of the delinquent taxpayer to be found within the county, with the minimum bid sufficient to pay the delinquency, together with interest and late charges thereon and together with all fees, commissions, mileage and costs accruing thereon.

The collection of any delinquency, or the return of a warrant of distraint showing no property found, shall relieve the county sheriff and tax collector and their bondsmen from responsibility of that delinquency. Upon the return of any warrant of distraint showing property taxes uncollected it shall be the duty of the tax collector, when directed by the county commissioners, to commence and prosecute to judgment an action against the delinquent taxpayer, and no property shall be exempt from levy and sale upon execution issued on the judgment.

        Where taxpayer alleged that warrants of distraint and tax receipts did not adequately and sufficiently describe the property, but where taxpayer failed to allege future damage through the county’s seeking again to collect the same taxes, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing taxpayer’s suit for declaratory judgment.

       All warrants of distraint issued by the tax collector shall be served and executed by the sheriff in the manner provided by law for the services of executions by levy upon personal property and he shall make return of the same to the tax collector of the county within ninety (90) days from the date of his receipt thereof with an endorsement thereon showing that the delinquency therein described, together with interest, late charges and costs, as provided by law, have been collected, or that, no property can be found to seize under the warrant. For making a false return the sheriff shall be liable to the county for double the amount of the property taxes, with interest and costs.

       Fees allowed for issuing warrants of distraint, collection, levy and return of the same, shall be set by ordinance by the board of county commissioners. When levying on a warrant of distraint, the provisions of section 31-3203, Idaho Code, shall apply in determining service fees.

       If the sheriff returns the warrant of distraint showing that no property can be found upon which a levy can be made to collect the delinquency, he shall note in the return the county, if any, in this state to which the delinquent taxpayer may have moved together with his mailing address and the date of his departure shall also be noted on the returns. Upon the filing of the sheriff’s return showing that any delinquent taxpayer has moved to another county in this state, it shall be the duty of the tax collector to immediately issue and mail another warrant of distraint to the sheriff of the county to which the delinquent taxpayer is so shown to have moved, or in which personal property belonging to him may be found, and the sheriff to whom the other warrant of distraint is issued shall serve and return the warrant in the manner provided for the service and return of original warrants of distraint, making return of fees and commissions earned by him to the county auditor of his county, and paying any delinquency and fees collected, shown by the other warrant of distraint to be due, to the tax collector issuing the other warrant. Should a sheriff to whom the other warrant of distraint is issued be unable to find any property out of which the delinquency may be collected, he shall so return to the tax collector issuing the warrant.

        Where Boise City charter provided that city taxes should be levied by the mayor and council, assessed by the city assessor, and collected by the city collector, the constitution did not prohibit the legislature from transferring the duties of the collection of Boise City taxes, and other duties as to taxes, from the city officials to the county officials, but the county officials, in collecting such taxes, merely acted as agents of the city in performance of the duties required of them.

        Under constitutional provisions and statutes, county assessor was chargeable with all money coming into his possession in payment of personal property taxes and for motor vehicle licenses and would be given credit therefor only when he actually paid such money into county treasury. Bonneville County v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., 57 Idaho 657, 67 P.2d 904 (1937).

Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, in any case in which the county commissioners find that, due to error or otherwise by fault of the county, an excess amount of property tax was paid, the county commissioners may refund the excess amount so collected plus pay the same late charges and delinquency interest rate on that amount which the county would regularly require of a taxpayer who is delinquent, and the county commissioners may adopt an ordinance or resolution to establish such payments.

        Conceding the assessment of 1952 of the property in question to have been excessive and subject to reduction by the board of equalization, it was not for that reason an unlawful or void assessment; nor was it an “erroneous assessment . . . through error” as to invalidate the taxes levied thereon. Hence the order by the district court for refund for the taxes paid for 1952 was not authorized by this section. In re Felton’s Petition, 79 Idaho 325, 316 P.2d 1064 (1957).

       In the event a refund is paid, payments must be made by warrants drawn on the county’s current expense fund by the county auditor.

The auditor shall charge the various funds and taxing districts with their proportionate share of the refund and credit the current expense account.

      § 63-1305C. Taxation and refund of property taxes collected on a tax exempt property.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col11">
       It is the intent of the legislature that property that is being constructed or renovated to fulfill a purpose that is exempt from taxation under the constitution or the laws of Idaho shall not be subject to property tax during the period of construction or renovation preparatory to its completion for a tax exempt use.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col12">
       A property owner may apply to the board of county commissioners for a provisional property tax exemption at the time that a building permit is applied for or at the time that construction or renovation of the property begins, whichever is earlier, or at any time thereafter during construction or renovation of the property. If the board of county commissioners finds that the intended use of the property, once construction or renovation has been completed, qualifies for a property tax exemption under the constitution or the laws of the state of Idaho, it shall grant a provisional property tax exemption, conditioned on the achievement of the intended tax exempt purpose. Any property with a provisional property tax exemption shall not be included on the county assessor’s new construction roll, and no taxes shall be assessed on the property during the period of its exemption.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col13">
       Once construction or renovation of a property with a provisional property tax exemption has been completed, the board of county commissioners shall review the tax exempt status of the completed property. In the event that the property does not qualify for a tax exemption, the board of county commissioners shall revoke the provisional property tax exemption and the property owner shall be liable for back taxes that would have been due on the property during construction, if not for the granting of the provisional property tax exemption. Property that is actually used for its intended tax exempt purpose shall be granted a property tax exemption by the board of county commissioners, if such approval is required under section 63-602, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col14">
       In the event that property taxes have been assessed and collected on a property during the time that it qualified for a provisional property tax exemption and whose owner applied for a provisional property tax exemption during construction or renovation, the property owner may apply to the board of county commissioners for a refund of the property taxes within five (5) years of the payment of such taxes. The board of county commissioners shall order a refund of any property taxes imposed on a tax exempt property. The county commissioners shall refund the collected taxes to the owner within forty-five (45) days of a finding by the county commissioners or of an order by the board of tax appeals or a court that the taxes should not have been collected on the property. If the property is only partially exempt, the county commissioners may apply the amount to be refunded as a credit against taxes due from the taxpayer in the following year or may use a combination of both a payment and a credit to effect the refund.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col15">
       As used in this section, “refund” includes property tax described in subsection (4) of this section found by the county commissioners, the board of tax appeals or a court to have been overpaid and not lawfully due, interest due on the refund of such tax, costs and any other amounts ordered paid by a court or the board of tax appeals.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col16">
       In the event a refund is paid, payments must be made by warrants drawn on the county’s current expense fund by the county auditor. The auditor shall apportion the amount of property taxes canceled as credit to the tax collector. The auditor shall charge the various funds and taxing districts with their proportionate share of the refund and credit the current expense fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col17">
       If a credit is given the following year, the credit shall be allowed against actual property taxes assessed to the taxpayer by the taxing districts that received the taxes being refunded.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c13s63-1305Col18">
       Amounts equal to the refunds or credits allowed in this section may not be included in amounts certified pursuant to sections 63-802 through 63-807, Idaho Code.

This time requirement between elections shall not apply to municipalities or water and/or sewer districts when bond issues are being proposed for the installation or improvement of water supply systems or public sewerage systems which have been deemed necessary by the Idaho state board of health and welfare to bring such system or systems in conformance with state statutes or rules of the state board of health and welfare.

The county board of equalization may excuse the liability for such penalty upon a proper showing that by good and sufficient cause the requirement to list such property need not be complied with.

A certificate by the secretary of state under the great seal of the state that such officers have authority to collect the tax is conclusive evidence of such authority.

      <li id="t63c14s63-1404ol12">
       Every county officer or employee performing related functions shall provide information regarding property rolls and related documents and procedures and parcel numbers to the state tax commission as provided in section 63-219, Idaho Code, may use the computer software prescribed and furnished by the state tax commission, and shall record and transmit information required by the state tax commission in the performance of its duties.

       Whenever it appears to the state tax commission that any public officer or employee whose duties relate to the assessment or equalization of assessments of property for taxation has failed to comply with any law relating to such duties, or the rules of the state tax commission made in pursuance thereof, the state tax commission, after a hearing on the facts, may request an order directing the public officer or employee to comply with such law or rule. An order of the state tax commission may require a county to conduct a revaluation of some or all of the property within the county as the state tax commission may find necessary to promote uniformity of taxation within the county. When necessary for the implementation of such an order, the state tax commission is empowered to reconvene a county board of equalization for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days beyond the date otherwise prescribed for the adjournment of such board for the sole purpose of permitting the board to hear and determine protests of valuations resulting from such ordered reappraisal provided that such protests are filed on or before the date otherwise prescribed for the adjournment of the board of equalization and that such extension is necessary for the proper completion of the board’s duties. The order may further permit the certification of estimated values by the county to the state tax commission subject to the approval of the tax commission if necessary to permit the board of equalization to properly complete its work and such values, when approved by the tax commission, may be used to set levies if actual values are unavailable on the date prescribed for setting levies.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c14s63-1404ol14">
       If such public officer or employee, for a period of ten (10) days after service on him of the state tax commission’s order, neglects or refuses to comply therewith, the state tax commission may apply to a judge of the district court of the county in which the public officer holds office for an order, returnable within five (5) days thereof, to compel such public officer or employee to comply with the state tax commission’s order, or to show cause why he should not be compelled to do so.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c14s63-1404ol15">
       Any order issued by the judge pursuant thereto shall be final; provided however, that any person aggrieved by such order may appeal to the supreme court of the state of Idaho in the manner provided for appeals in other civil actions. An appeal shall not stay any order issued by any judge.

      Any county officer upon whom any duties devolve under the revenue laws of this state, who willfully neglects or refuses to perform any such duty, may be removed from office in the manner prescribed by law. When proceedings are commenced to remove such officer, the county commissioners, or in case such officer be a commissioner, then the district judge, may suspend such officer from his powers and duties under the revenue laws, and appoint a competent person in his place until a proper tribunal has either removed or acquitted such suspended officer. Any act relating to the appraisal of property, the assessment of property, the levy or collection of property taxes, or the sale of property for nonpayment of property taxes, performed by any such temporary officer, is valid and of the same force and effect as if performed by a duly qualified officer, elected to such office; provided, that such temporary officer has been bonded, as is required of persons duly elected to such office.

      § 63-1703. Certain forest lands to be designated for taxation by owner — Limitations.
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purposes of appraisal, assessment and taxation under the provisions of this chapter, all forest lands in parcels of five (5) or more acres but less than five thousand (5,000), whether contiguous or not, as long as such parcels are held in common ownership, must be designated by the forest landowner to be subject to the provisions of either subsection (a) or (b) of this section. A forest landowner cannot have parcels designated under the provisions of both subsections (a) and (b) of this section at one time. If the forest landowner fails to make a designation, his forest lands shall be subject to appraisal, assessment and taxation under the provisions of section 63-1702, Idaho Code. Once a designation is made by the forest landowner, such designation must remain in effect until the designation period expires, unless the forest lands are transferred to another owner using a different taxing category; in such case, the taxing category of the transferred forest lands shall be the same as that maintained by the new owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      A forest landowner may change the designation of all forest lands in common ownership at the end of any designation period, subject to the recapture of any deferred taxes due as a result of such change. After January 1 and by December 31 of the tenth year of each designation period, the forest landowner must notify the county assessor of any change in forest land designation. Failure to notify the county assessor will result in the continuation of the landowner’s present designation until the end of the next designation period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any substantial change in the use of forest lands not conforming with the definition of “forest land” in section 63-1701, Idaho Code, during such ten (10) year period under the designations made in subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be reported by the landowner to the county assessor within thirty (30) days of the change in use. Upon notification of the change in use or a determination by the assessor that the land no longer meets the definition of “forest land” in section 63-1701, Idaho Code, the assessor shall appraise, assess and tax those acres as provided by applicable laws and rules. Failure to notify the assessor of the change in use when forest lands have been designated as subject to the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall cause forfeiture of such designation and cause that property to be appraised, assessed and taxed as provided in section 63-1702, Idaho Code. If there are deferred taxes subject to recapture as a result of loss of forest land designation, the assessor shall take no action to supply deferred tax amounts to the county treasurer before the taxpayer has been notified and provided an opportunity to appeal the decision of the assessor to the county board of equalization. Said appeal shall be considered timely if filed with the county clerk within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notification of the decision of the assessor. Upon the filing of a timely appeal, the taxpayer shall be given at least ten (10) days’ notice of the date and location of the next meeting of the county board of equalization at which the appeal shall be considered. Once the appeal is considered, the county board of equalization shall notify the appellant of the decision, which is further appealable pursuant to section 63-511, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forest lands designated for assessment pursuant to the provisions of section 63-1706, Idaho Code, shall be subject to the recapture of deferred taxes upon removal of such designation, a substantial change in use, or ownership transfer, except that there shall be no recapture initiated upon ownership transfer of forest lands designated as subject to the provisions of section 63-1706, Idaho Code, to a landowner with forest lands already designated as subject to the provisions of section 63-1706, Idaho Code, prior to the transfer, or who so designates his lands to be subject to the provisions of section 63-1706, Idaho Code. In the event payment is offered or made, it shall be accepted by the county treasurer and applied in the manner of payment of other property tax.
    The dollar amount of deferred taxes subject to recapture shall be determined by the county assessor by applying current tax levies against the current values that would have been in effect if the lands were subject to appraisal and assessment during the current year under the provisions of section 63-1705, Idaho Code, if there has been a change in ownership or a removal of designation, or section 63-1702, Idaho Code, if there has been a change in use with no change in ownership, which amount shall be multiplied by the number of years that the lands have been subject to the designation under section 63-1706, Idaho Code. The amount of the deferred tax shall accrue through designation periods, up to a maximum of ten (10) years, and shall apply to the most recent ten (10) years in which the parcel has been designated under the provisions of section 63-1706, Idaho Code. A credit shall be allowed for taxes actually paid under the provisions of section 63-1706, Idaho Code, for an identical ten (10) year period, up to the total amount of the deferred taxes. All deferred amounts shall be a lien against the land. Deferred tax amounts shall be calculated by the county assessor on forms prescribed by the state tax commission. Deferred tax amounts shall be supplied by the county assessor to the county treasurer by May 15 of the year following conveyance or within thirty (30) days of the lapsing or conclusion of the appeals procedure provided in this section with regard to the removal of the forest land designation, or of learning of a change in use. All deferred tax amounts shall be due and payable to the county treasurer on demand and shall become delinquent if not paid by the demand due date specified by the county treasurer on the forms prescribed by the state tax commission. If the deferred tax is not paid as provided in this section, the payment becomes delinquent and subject to late charges and interest in the amounts provided in sections 63-201(12) and 63-1001, Idaho Code, and subject to collection in the manner as set forth in chapter 10, title 63, Idaho Code. Estimated deferred tax amounts may be held by the county treasurer in a tax anticipation account from the date of conveyance until June 1 of the year following conveyance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The county treasurer shall cause the deferred taxes and any penalty and interest paid pursuant to the provisions of this section to be apportioned to the various taxing authorities within which the property subject to the tax is located in the same manner as property taxes.

Furthermore, the actual annual valuation calculations shall not exceed a five percent (5%) adjustment from the previous year’s valuation calculation. When the model-derived values for a given year are below the floor, the forest land value for taxation purposes will be equal to the floor value for that year.

      This act is designed to promote access to short-term rentals and vacation rentals by limiting local governmental authority to prohibit these beneficial property uses, or to specifically target them for regulation, except in circumstances necessary to safeguard public health and welfare. This act is also designed to preserve personal property rights and promote property owner access to platforms for offering their properties as short-term rentals and vacation rentals, and enhancing local tax revenue by permitting platforms to assume tax collection and remittance responsibilities.

        Court could not conclude that Congress’s explicit concession permitting states to tax federal government reservations on motor fuel deliveries also embodied an implied vitiation of Indians’ sovereignty. Given the standard for finding that Congress has authorized states by taxation to intrude on the sovereignty of Indian tribes, which requires that the showing of congressional intent be “unmistakably clear,” and analyzing the Hayden-Cartwright Act’s text (4 USCS § 104), structure, and legislative history in this light, the court concluded that Congress did not abrogate the tribes’ immunity from state taxation of fuels delivered to and sold on their reservations.

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2007 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 37, in subsection (7), deleted “received during the reporting period and included in the report” following “motor fuel” in the introductory language; in subsection (7)(a), added the language beginning “imported or blended during the reporting period”; rewrote subsection (7)(b), which formerly read: “Biodiesel, in whole or in part, deduct the number of gallons of agricultural products or animal fats or the wastes of such products contained in the fuel”; and added subsections (7)(c) and (7)(e), and made a related redesignation.
    The 2007 amendment, by ch. 288, in subsection (4), in the first sentence, substituted “two percent” for “one percent” and deleted “the expense incurred on behalf of the state of Idaho in collecting and remitting motor fuel tax moneys, maintaining necessary records for the state, preparing necessary reports and remittances in compliance with this chapter, and for” preceding “loss from evaporation,” and deleted the former last four sentences, which read: “The licensed distributor may, in addition to the above, deduct the number of gallons equal to one percent (1%) of the total number of gallons received during the preceding calendar month, less the total number of gallons deducted under subsections (1) through (3) of this section, to cover shrinkage, evaporation, spillage and handling losses of a retail dealer. The latter deductions are to be allowed only upon filing with the commission satisfactory evidence as may be prescribed by it indicating the credit allowance has been made in favor of the retail dealer or paid to him. The evidence shall be submitted together with the report wherein this portion of the deduction is claimed. A licensed distributor who sells and delivers motor fuel directly to the consumer and not for resale shall, with respect to those sales, be deemed a retail dealer for the purposes of this section”; and deleted former subsection (6), which pertained to sales made on or after July 1, 1995, and redesignated former subsection (7) as (6).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 332, deleted subsection (6), regarding deductions for certain motor fuels.

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1995 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 132, § 3, in subsection (3) added “which is” following “any gasoline”; in subsection (3)(b) added “provided however, if tax has been paid at the rate provided in section 63-2405, Idaho Code, on any motor fuel placed in the fuel supply tank of an aircraft the user of the fuel may apply for a refund of the difference between the tax paid on the fuel and the tax imposed in section 63-2408, Idaho Code,” following “placed in an aircraft”; in subsection (3)(d) added “or in boats operated by a governmental entity” following “motor boats”; in subsection (5)(a) in the first sentence added a comma following “under subsection (1)” and added “or (3)(b)” preceding “of this section”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 348, § 2, in subsection (5)(a) in the last sentence substituted “rule” for “regulation” following “may provide by” and substituted “monthly” for “quarterly” following “submitted and paid on a”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 35, rewrote paragraph (2)(b), which formerly read: “Propelling equipment or vehicles which are not licensed to be operated on a highway”; in paragraph (5)(a), added the second sentence and substituted “for any period not greater than one year or less than one (1) month” for “on a monthly basis and reconciled on the income tax return when it is filed”; and rewrote paragraph (5)(b), which formerly read: “If a claimant is not required to file an income tax return, the refund claim shall be made on forms and in the manner as the commission may provide. The claim shall relate to taxes paid on gasoline actually purchased in the calendar year preceding the filing and the claim shall be due on or before April 15 following the close of the calendar year.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 81, deleted “calendar” following “one (1)” near the beginning of the introductory language of subsection (2); in paragraph (5)(b), deleted “calendar year” preceding “filing cycle” in the first sentence and, in the second sentence, deleted “calendar” following “purchased in the” and substituted “according to income tax payment requirements in section 63-3085, Idaho Code” for “on or before the fifteenth day of April following the close of the calendar year” at the end.

       At the time an application for a motor fuel distributor license under section 63-2427A, Idaho Code, is submitted to the commission, the applicant shall file a bond with the commission conditioned upon faithful performance of all of the requirements of this chapter. The total amount of the bond shall be fixed by the commission and shall be equivalent to at least twice the estimated average tax liability for the reporting period for which the applicant will be required to file a distributor’s report under section 63-2406, Idaho Code. The bond required by this section shall in no case be less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). Based on prior years’ experience, the total amount required to be secured by the bond may be increased or reduced by the commission at any time. The bond will be waived if the commission is satisfied that the distributor has the financial responsibility to meet the required bond amount. Financial responsibility may be determined by the commission upon review of all relevant public documents including appropriate county records and records of tax payments to the state of Idaho. The distributor can be required to provide a commercial credit rating, balance sheet, or income statement to demonstrate present financial solvency, i.e. ownership of real and/or personal property, the unencumbered value of which exceeds the bond amount otherwise required. If such financial solvency is established, and if the distributor has been doing business in Idaho as a licensed distributor for five (5) or more consecutive years without a default in the payment of taxes imposed in this chapter, financial responsibility shall be presumed. Any bond given in conjunction with this chapter shall be a continuing instrument, and shall cover the period during which the license in connection with which the bond is given is in effect, unless the surety on the bond is released or discharged by the commission. Any surety on any bond furnished by a licensee shall be discharged and released from any and all liability to the state accruing on the bond after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date upon which the surety shall have lodged with the commission a written request to be released and discharged. The request shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge the surety from any liability accrued, or which will accrue, before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period. The commission shall promptly, upon receipt of the notice of the request, notify the licensee and require him to furnish a new bond. Unless the licensee files a new bond with the commission in the amount provided in this section before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the commission shall immediately cancel the licensee’s license.

      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol11">
       The commission may enter into cooperative agreements with other jurisdictions for exchange of information and auditing of distributors, dealers and users of motor fuels. The commission shall participate in the international fuel tax agreement as required by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991, Public Law 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, including subsequent amendments to that agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol12">
       Any person operating a motor vehicle over twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds maximum gross weight which is (a) based in this state and (b) operated in this state and in any other jurisdiction which is a member of the international fuels tax agreement shall report and pay all fuel use taxes due to any IFTA member jurisdiction, together with any other charges due to any such jurisdiction which are reportable on the IFTA report, in the manner required by IFTA. If the provisions set forth in the international fuel tax agreement are in conflict with any provision of this chapter, the agreement provisions shall prevail. An agreement, arrangement, declaration or amendment thereto is not effective until stated, in writing, and filed with the commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol13">
       An agreement may provide for determining the base jurisdiction for users, users records requirements, audit procedures, exchange of information, persons eligible for tax licensing, defining qualified motor vehicles, determining if bonding is required, specifying reporting requirements and periods including defining uniform penalty and interest rates for late reporting, determining methods for collecting and forwarding of motor fuels taxes, penalties or interest to another jurisdiction, and other provisions as will facilitate the administration of the agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol14">
       The commission may, as required by the terms of an agreement, forward to officers of another jurisdiction any information in the commission’s possession relative to the manufacture, receipts, sale, use, transportation, or shipment of motor fuels by any person. The commission may disclose to officers of another jurisdiction, the location of officers, motor vehicles, and other real and personal property of users of motor fuels.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol15">
       An agreement may provide for each jurisdiction to audit the records of persons based in the jurisdiction, to determine if the motor fuels taxes due each jurisdiction are properly reported and paid. Each jurisdiction shall forward the findings of the audits performed on persons based in the jurisdiction, to each jurisdiction in which the person has taxable use of motor fuels. For persons not based in this state and who have taxable use of motor fuels in Idaho, the commission may serve the audit findings received from another jurisdiction, in the form of an assessment, on the person as though an audit was conducted by the commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol16">
       The commission may enter into additional cooperative agreements with other jurisdictions for mutual enforcement of taxes on gasoline and special fuels not subject to collection pursuant to the international fuel tax agreement. Such agreements may provide for collection and enforcement of the motor fuels taxes of all signatory jurisdictions pursuant to the law, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which a person liable for such taxes maintains his principal place of business. An agreement may provide for any or all of the following: determining the base jurisdiction of persons liable for taxes, records requirements, audit procedures, exchange of information, persons eligible for tax licensing, determining if bonding is required, specifying reporting requirements and periods including defining uniform penalty and interest rates for late reporting, determining methods for collecting and forwarding of motor fuels taxes and penalties to another jurisdiction, and other provisions as will facilitate the administration of the agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol17">
       Any agreement entered into pursuant to this section does not preclude the commission from auditing the records of any person covered by the provisions of this chapter.

      <li id="t63c24s63-2442Aol18">
       The legal remedies for any person served with an order or assessment under this section are as prescribed in this chapter.

       If the commission enters into any agreement under the authority of this section, and the provisions set forth in the agreement are in conflict with any rules promulgated by the commission, the agreement provisions prevail.

Within sixty-three (63) days after the notice is mailed, the person may file a protest in writing requesting a review of the decision. The appeal must contain legal or factual reasons why the person disagrees with the decision. The person may not make any proceedings at court or other action until the appeal rights relating to the decision have become final.

       A person will not be issued a distributor license after one has previously been revoked, unless the state tax commission is satisfied that the former holder of the license will comply with all the requirements of this chapter and correct any other violations of this chapter upon which the revocation was based. All bonding requirements for the reinstated licensee must be met. A bond waiver may not be requested for five (5) years after the reinstatement of the license. A reinstated distributor’s bond is not subject to the maximum bonding limits in section 63-2428, Idaho Code, but may not exceed the estimated tax liability for six (6) months.

        This section was amended by two 1995 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 160, § 1, in the second sentence substituted “to facilitate and provide” for “for”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 368, § 2, substituted “package” for both occurrences of “pack”, in the second sentence substituted “Five cents (5¢)” for “Ten cents (10¢)”, and added the present third sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2014 amendment, by ch. 115, substituted “Beginning July 1, 2014, and every year thereafter, of the tax collected pursuant to this subsection, three million three hundred fifteen thousand dollars ($3,315,000)” for “5.1746¢ of the tax collected per package of twenty (20) cigarettes” at the beginning the second and third sentences in subsection (1).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 94, in the second sentence of subsection (1), inserted “develop and implement school safety improvements and to” and “prevention” and added “and the Idaho bureau of educational services for the deaf and the blind” at the end.

       <p>
        Sections 1 and 7 of S.L. 1995, ch. 368 read: “Section 1. Legislative Intent. The Legislature finds that under the restructuring of the juvenile corrections system in the State of Idaho the counties of the state are charged with the supervision of juvenile offenders throughout their involvement in the juvenile corrections system. Increasing demands placed upon county juvenile probation services may require increases in probationary staff and the establishment or expansion of treatment programs. The primary purpose of this legislation is to provide a source of funding to assist the counties in meeting start-up costs for expanded juvenile probation services and associated programs made necessary by this shift of responsibilities. It is the further intent of the Legislature that each county submit an annual written report to the Department of Juvenile Corrections of the manner in which funds received have been spent.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It is the further intent of the Legislature that the division of funds established in this legislation be reevaluated to determine whether the distribution of resources between substance abuse programs in the public school system and juvenile justice probationary services and treatment programs for juvenile offenders effectively addresses the needs of our youth and the community.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Section 7. It is the intent of this Legislature that the funding created by this act is compatible with legislative intent expressed in Sections 63-2506 and 63-2552A, Idaho Code, and that the funding created by this act shall be reexamined in one year for the purposes of determining whether the funding so created remains justifiable under Sections 63-2506 and 63-2552A, Idaho Code.”

       At the time an application for a wholesaler’s license or permit, under section 63-2503, Idaho Code, is submitted to the state tax commission, the applicant shall file a bond, in such form as the commission may determine, conditioned upon faithful performance of all of the requirements of this chapter. The total amount of the bond shall be fixed by the commission and shall be the greater of twice the estimated average tax liability for the reporting period for which the applicant will be required to file a return, under section 63-2510, Idaho Code, or the value of stamps in the wholesaler’s inventory including the value of stamps ordered but not yet received. The total amount required to be secured by the bond may be increased or reduced by the commission at any time. Any bond given in conjunction with the provisions of this section shall be a continuing instrument, and shall cover the period during which the license or permit in connection with which the bond is given is in effect, unless the surety on the bond is released or discharged by the commission. Any surety on any bond furnished by a wholesaler shall be discharged only by the commission. Any surety on any bond furnished by a wholesaler shall be discharged and released by the commission from, any and all, liability to the state, accruing on the bond after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date upon which the surety shall have lodged with the commission a written request to be released and discharged. The request shall not operate to relieve, release, or discharge the surety from any liability accrued, or which will accrue, before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period. The commission shall promptly, upon receipt of the notice of the request, notify the wholesaler and require him to furnish a new bond. Unless the wholesaler files a new bond with the commission in the amount provided in this section before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the commission shall immediately cancel the wholesaler’s license or permit.

      </li>
      <li id="t63c25s63-2510Aol13">
       A wholesaler may pay full value for stamps in advance in lieu of posting a bond. A wholesaler that has posted a bond may petition for release from the bond requirement after having filed timely and fully paid cigarette tax returns, as provided in section 63-2510, Idaho Code, for a period of not less than twelve (12) months. Upon such petition from the wholesaler, the commission will review the cigarette tax return filing and payment record of the wholesaler and, if determined necessary, within sixty (60) days examine the books and records of the wholesaler. The commission will, no later than ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the petition, advise the wholesaler in writing of its determination and the reasons therefor. If the wholesaler wishes to seek a redetermination of the commission’s decision, a petition for redetermination may be filed as provided in section 63-3045, Idaho Code.
    (4) If at any time after release of a bond requirement the wholesaler becomes delinquent for any period in the filing of tax returns or the payment of the tax as required in section 63-2510, Idaho Code, the commission may make immediate demand that the return be filed or the payment be tendered and that a bond be filed as set forth in subsection (1) of this section. Any wholesaler against whom such demand is made may petition for a redetermination as provided in section 63-3045, Idaho Code, except that the petition must be filed no later than ten (10) days after service upon the person of notice thereof. If a petition for redetermination is not filed within the ten (10) day period, the determination shall become final and the commission shall issue a jeopardy assessment as provided in section 63-3630, Idaho Code, and thereafter may:

      (5) A wholesaler who acquires all cigarettes with tax stamps affixed at the time of acquisition may petition the state tax commission for waiver of the bond required in subsection (1) of this section. Upon receipt of evidence establishing that the wholesaler is not required to pay cigarette taxes under this chapter because the wholesaler exclusively purchases cigarettes with stamps affixed by another wholesaler, the state tax commission may waive the requirement for a bond. Any such waiver is conditioned upon the wholesaler’s continuing qualification for the waiver under this subsection.

        This section was amended by two 2006 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
    The 2006 amendment, by ch. 60, deleted former subsection (c) which read: “Failure to possess a valid permit, as required by section 63-2503, Idaho Code, shall be punishable by the imposition of civil penalties at the rate of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per day, per violation, and such penalty shall be assessed and collected, as provided in section 63-2516, Idaho Code” and redesignated former subsections (d) and (e) as (c) and (d).

        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 196, rewrote subsection (b), which formerly read: “The possession by any person of more than ten (10) packages of cigarettes without Idaho cigarette stamps is a misdemeanor. Any person upon conviction shall be subject to a fine of five dollars ($5.00) for each full or partial package of unstamped cigarettes in his possession in excess of ten (10), but the maximum punishment for each offense shall not exceed a fine of three hundred dollars ($300) or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed ninety (90) days or both” and added the second paragraph in subsection (b).

       <p>
        The 1994 amendment, by ch. 45, § 2, in the second sentence of paragraph (b)(3), substituted “the fiscal year’s appropriation” for “one hundred ten thousand dollars ($110,00) per fiscal year” and substituted “the appropriation” for “one hundred ten thousand dollars ($110,000)” in two instances.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 344, in subsection (b)(2), substituted “central cancer registry fund” for “central tumor registry account” three times; and, in subsection (4), inserted “less the amount distributed under section 67-7434(2), Idaho Code, if applicable.”

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 322, in subsection (5), rewrote paragraph (iii), which formerly read: “All remaining moneys following distributions pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph shall be distributed to the state highway account for the purpose of paying for the maintenance and repair (and including purchase of rights-of-way) of the state highway system”. Legislative Intent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2006, ch. 311 provided: “Legislative Findings and Intent. The Legislature hereby finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans, 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case, Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State, 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
    “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and

        Section 4 of S.L. 1995, ch. 160 read: “It is legislative intent that because substance abuse programs in the public schools are threatened by reduction of federal funds that the funds appropriated in Section 3 of this act [an appropriation] shall be used to continue programs established under the federal drug-free schools and communities program. It is further legislative intent that the funds shall be distributed to the districts as follows: fifty percent ($300,000) on the basis of student enrollment, and fifty percent ($300,000) on the same basis as the chapter I federal funding formula which indicates low income districts.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Sections 1 and 7 of S.L. 1995, ch. 368 read: “Section 1. Legislative Intent. The Legislature finds that under the restructuring of the juvenile corrections system in the State of Idaho the counties of the state are charged with the supervision of juvenile offenders throughout their involvement in the juvenile corrections system. Increasing demands placed upon county juvenile probation services may require increases in probationary staff and the establishment or expansion of treatment programs. The primary purpose of this legislation is to provide a source of funding to assist the counties in meeting start-up costs for expanded juvenile probation services and associated programs made necessary by this shift of responsibilities. It is the further intent of the Legislature that each county submit an annual written report to the Department of Juvenile Corrections of the manner in which funds received have been spent.
    “It is the further intent of the Legislature that the division of funds established in this legislation be reevaluated to determine whether the distribution of resources between substance abuse programs in the public school system and juvenile justice probationary services and treatment programs for juvenile offenders effectively addresses the needs of our youth and the community.”

        “Section 7. It is the intent of this Legislature that the funding created by this act is compatible with legislative intent expressed in Sections 63-2506 and 63-2552A, Idaho Code, and that the funding created by this act shall be reexamined in one year for the purposes of determining whether the funding so created remains justifiable under Sections 63-2506 and 63-2552A, Idaho Code.”

     <p>
      Every distributor shall keep at each registered place of business complete and accurate records for that place of business, including itemized invoices, of tobacco products held, purchased, manufactured, brought in or caused to be brought in from without the state, or shipped or transported to retailers in this state, and of all sales of tobacco products made, except sales to the ultimate consumer.

      When a registered distributor sells tobacco products exclusively to the ultimate consumer at the address given in the certificate, no invoice of those sales shall be required, but itemized invoices shall be made of all tobacco products transferred to other retail outlets owned or controlled by that registered distributor. All books, records, and other papers and documents required by this section to be kept shall be preserved for a period of at least five (5) years after the date of the documents, as aforesaid, or the date of the entries thereof appearing in the records, unless the commission, in writing, authorizes their destruction or disposal at an earlier date. At any time during usual business hours, the commission, or its duly authorized agents or employees, may enter any place of business of a distributor, without a search warrant, and inspect the premises, the records required to be kept under this chapter, and the tobacco products contained therein, to determine whether or not all the provisions of this chapter are being fully complied with. If the commission, or any of its agents or employees, is denied free access or is hindered or interfered with in making such examination, the permit of the distributor at such premises shall be subject to revocation by the commission.

      All mines and mining claims, both placer and rock in place, containing or bearing gold, silver, copper, lead, coal or other valuable mineral or metal deposits, after purchase thereof from the United States, shall be taxed at the price paid the United States therefor, unless the surface ground, or some part thereof, of said mine or mining claim is used for other than mining purposes, and has a separate and independent value for such other purposes, in which case said surface ground or any part thereof so used for other than mining purposes, shall be taxed at its value for such other purposes, and all machinery used in mining, and all property and surface improvements upon mines or mining claims, which have a value separate and independent of such mines or mining claims and the net annual proceeds of all mines and mining claims shall be taxed: provided, that nothing in this chapter contained must be construed so as to exempt from taxation improvements, buildings, erections, structures or machinery placed upon any mining claims, or used in connection therewith: provided that all mineral rights reserved to any grantor, except the United States or the state of Idaho, by the terms of any conveyance of lands other than lands acquired under the mining laws of the United States shall be assessed for taxation purposes at the rate of not less than five dollars ($5.00) per acre of the mineral rights so reserved, to be assessed against the recorded owner thereof. When, in the opinion of the county assessor, the value of reserved mineral rights does not warrant the expenditure to appraise and assess such value, such de minimis values need not be appraised or assessed, but the failure to assess such values does not constitute a failure to pay such taxes on the part of the owner, and does not constitute a delinquency on the part of the owner.

        A prior income tax law S.L. 1931 (E.S.), ch. 2, §§ 1 to 80 as amended formerly compiled as<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c30s63-3001" target="_self">§§ 63-3001 </a></cite>to 63-3088 was repealed by § 82 of S.L. 1959, ch. 299 and the new tax law assigned the same section numbers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 12 of S.L. 1967, ch. 294, read: “In the event the office of the tax collector is merged with the state tax commission, determinations, jeopardy determinations, redeterminations, compromises, closing agreements and similar responsibilities required to be performed by the tax collector under the Idaho Income Tax Act and the Idaho Sales Tax Act shall be performed by the member of the state tax commission assigned the duty of supervisor of the division of taxation involved.” The office of state tax collector has been abolished and the powers and duties transferred to the state tax commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        The words “this act” refer to S.L. 1959, chapter 299, which is compiled as<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c30s63-3001" target="_self">§§ 63-3001 </a></cite>to 63-3006, 63-3007 to 63-3010, 63-3012, 63-3013, 63-3014, 63-3016 to 63-3018, 63-3020, 63-3022, 63-3023, 63-3024, 63-3027, 63-3029, 63-3030, 63-3031 to 63-3035, 63-3036, 63-3037 to 63-3039, 63-3040 to 63-3045, 63-3046, 63-3047 to 63-3051, 63-3055 to 63-3060, 63-3061, 63-3062 to 63-3065, 63-3066, 63-3067, 63-3069, 63-3071, 63-3073 to 63-3077, and 63-3078 to 63-3080.

        Statutory provision that income should not be classified as property did not offend against state or federal constitution. Diefendorf v. Gallet, 51 Idaho 619, 10 P.2d 307 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature is not precluded from enacting an income tax law because there is no express provision therefor in the constitution. Diefendorf v. Gallet, 51 Idaho 619, 10 P.2d 307 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute was not invalid as duplicate taxation of property. Diefendorf v. Gallet, 51 Idaho 619, 10 P.2d 307 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law was not invalid as imposing a burden on interstate commerce. Diefendorf v. Gallet, 51 Idaho 619, 10 P.2d 307 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law did not violate uniformity of taxation, due process, and equal protection clauses of state and federal constitutions, because of its provisions imposing a progressively graduated tax, allowing greater exemptions to married than to single persons, withholding from corporations credits allowed to individuals, and directing funds derived hereunder to be applied to reduction of state ad valorem levy. Diefendorf v. Gallet, 51 Idaho 619, 10 P.2d 307 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law imposes upon those who derive gain from within the state a fair and equitable tax, levied in graduated proportion upon their ability to pay, which is, in all respects, valid and constitutional. Diefendorf v. Gallet, 51 Idaho 619, 10 P.2d 307 (1932).
    The legislature, in defining the term “gross income” of life insurance companies to mean the gross amount received during a taxable year from interest, dividends and rents arising within the state, legislated within its power so to do. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 68 Idaho 185, 191 P.2d 359 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The tax imposed did not violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or the due process clause of the Idaho Constitution where the interest received by the water company upon bonds payable in another state was interest arising within the state within the meaning of the law imposing the tax on gross income of insurers, it being reasonably related to benefits conferred by the state and income arising out of the state. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Neill, 79 Idaho 385, 319 P.2d 195 (1957).

        Where statute defining “gross income,” which should be included in determining income tax, was copied in the most part from federal statute, the fact that the Idaho statute did not contain provision corresponding to provision of the federal statute, providing for taxation of salaries of president and federal judges, was convincing evidence of legislative intent not to tax salaries of state constitutional officers. Girard v. Defenbach, 61 Idaho 702, 106 P.2d 1010 (1932).

        The concept of the words “trade,” and “business” implies activities engaged in with a direct profit motive, in occupational and commercial aspects and the court so construed their meanings. Kopp v. Baird, 79 Idaho 152, 313 P.2d 319 (1957).

        The Property Relief Act of 1931 and amendments having incorporated in substantial part the provisions of the Federal Revenue Act, would be presumed as adopted with its prior constructions by the courts of the foreign jurisdiction. Kopp v. Baird, 79 Idaho 152, 313 P.2d 319 (1957).

Century Distilling Co. v. Defenbach, 61 Idaho 192, 99 P.2d 56 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action for declaratory judgment by foreign corporation against state tax commissioner to determine corporation’s obligation to pay tax on net income, with relation to its business transacted under the Liquor Control Act, was not an “action against the state” for maintenance of which state’s consent was necessary.

        Plaintiffs were entitled to deduct medical and hospital expenses in the sum of $2,901.18 less $100 from their state income tax regardless of reimbursement for such expenses received from insurance companies. Taylor v. Neill, 80 Idaho 90, 326 P.2d 391 (1958).
    The fact that a small portion of Idaho Power Company’s revenue was derived from business and properties outside of the state was not made a point for decision. The act contemplated an apportionment and deduction of income and expenses from outside the state. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Neill, 79 Idaho 385, 319 P.2d 195 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The clause “under regulations promulgated by the tax collector” contained in the statute could not be construed as a grant of legislative power authorizing the tax collector to limit the deduction which the legislature had allowed, such regulations so authorized having been only such as were needful for the enforcement of the law as written by the legislature and not to have been used to add to or detract therefrom. Taylor v. Neill, 80 Idaho 90, 326 P.2d 391 (1958).

        The state income tax statute, providing that “gross income” does not include income which may not be by the federal constitution or laws included in “gross income,” did not manifest an intention to tax the salaries of federal officials, on the ground that the United States Supreme Court decision holding that states were authorized to tax such salaries, and the federal statute authorizing states to tax such salaries had declared that there had never been any bar to such taxation, and that the legislature intended to tax such salaries when the previous bar should be lifted, where the state and federal governments were not authorized to tax the salaries of each other’s officials when the income tax statute was passed.

        Pursuant to agreement with liquor control commission, an Illinois corporation shipped liquors into the state for storage in a warehouse from which liquors were withdrawn on requisition of commission, the title remaining with the corporation until the liquors were withdrawn and tested by the commission, and on delivery to warehouse the shipments were severed from “interstate commerce,” as regards whether corporation was under obligation to make return and pay tax on net income.

        It is the intent of the legislature by the adoption of this act, insofar as possible to make the provisions of the Idaho act identical to the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code relating to the measurement of taxable income, to the end that the taxable income reported each taxable year by a taxpayer to the internal revenue service shall be the identical sum reported to this state, subject only to modifications contained in the Idaho law; to achieve this result by the application of the various provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code relating to the definition of income, exceptions therefrom, deductions (personal and otherwise), accounting methods, taxation of trusts, estates, partnerships and corporations, basis and other pertinent provisions to gross income as defined therein, resulting in an amount called “taxable income” in the Internal Revenue Code, and then to impose the provisions of this act thereon to derive a sum called “Idaho taxable income”; to impose a tax on residents of this state measured by Idaho taxable income wherever derived and on the Idaho taxable income of nonresidents which is the result of activity within or derived from sources within this state. All of the foregoing is subject to modifications in Idaho law including, without limitation, modifications applicable to unitary groups of corporations, which include corporations incorporated outside the United States.

        This section does not explicitly state that the state should adopt federal provisions for equitable relief from tax liability and has been read as not requiring adoption of every federal tax procedure. The supreme court has declined to adopt federal procedures when those procedures conflict with prescriptions in Idaho law. Sections 63-3047 and 63-3048 provide a mechanism by which the Idaho state tax commission may grant equitable relief. Parker v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 148 Idaho 842, 230 P.3d 734 (2010).

        Idaho’s taxation of a wife’s interest in her husband’s Texas income did not offend the dormant commerce or the privileges and immunities clauses of the United States Constitution, because (1) no interstate economic activity is burdened, (2) interaction of the different, but nondiscriminatory and internally consistent, Texas and Idaho tax schemes, is not unconstitutional, as Idaho’s scheme, if adopted by every state, would not disadvantage interstate commerce as compared to intrastate commerce, and (3) the wife did not show that Idaho taxed nonresidents differently than residents.

       <p>
        Application of equitable recoupment was not appropriate where the tax commission applied the taxpayer’s net operating losses (NOLs) in part to earlier tax years in order to recalculate the taxpayer’s income tax for later tax years. The tax commission did not assert a tax on the NOLs, but merely applied the NOLs as the law required; therefore, there was not a “single transaction” that constituted the taxable event upon which the tax commission’s claim for additional taxes was based, while at the same time being the basis of the taxpayer’s claim for recoupment.

        The fact that a taxpayer chose to claim the entire amount of net operating losses (NOLs) as deductions for later tax years rather than applying them first to earlier tax years, as required, and the fact that the tax commission subsequently correctly applied the NOLs and asserted a deficiency in the taxes due for the later tax years, did not preclude the application of the limitation provided in subsection (d) of former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c30s63-3072" target="_self">§ 63-3072</a></cite>.

        The fact that under this section the tax commission first carried the net operating losses back to earlier tax years before applying them to later tax years did not entitle the taxpayer to file amended returns for the earlier tax years and to treat the date of these amended returns as being the date for the beginning of a three-year statute of limitations under subsection (c) of former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c30s63-3072" target="_self">§ 63-3072</a></cite>, where, by the time the tax commission issued the notice of deficiency, more than three years had passed since the filing of the returns of the earlier tax years.

        The basis upon which depletion was allowed in respect to any property not specifically excepted from operation of the statute had to be governed by such statute; therefore, taxpayer was entitled to deduction from gross income for depletion on basis of cost or fair market value of calcium carbonate deposits depending on when such deposits were acquired, but was not entitled to deduction for depletion on basis of percentage of gross income.

        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 202, rewrote the section heading, which formerly read, “Deduction for insulation of residences” and rewrote the section, which formerly read: “For taxable years commencing on and after January 1, 1976, an individual taxpayer may deduct from taxable income an amount actually paid or accrued by the individual taxpayer during the taxable year for the actual installation, but not replacement, of insulation within any existing building in the state of Idaho which serves as a place of residence of the individual taxpayer. As used in this section, ‘insulation’ means any material commonly used in the building industry and actually installed for the purpose of retarding the passage of heat energy into or out of a building, including but not limited to, such items as fiberglass insulation, weather stripping, double pane windows, and storm doors and windows. As used in this section, ‘existing building’ means any building in being, under construction, or subject to an outstanding legal building permit on the effective date of this act.”
    The 2013 amendment, by ch. 4, inserted “in the state of Idaho” and “primary” in the last sentence of subsection (1).

        Section 1 of S.L. 1976, ch. 212, read: “It is declared to be the policy of the state of Idaho that the installation of energy-saving insulation materials in existing structures and the use of alternative energy devices, including solar and geothermal heating or cooling systems, should be encouraged as conserving nonrenewable resources, reducing environmental pollution and promoting the health and well-being of the people of this state, and should be valued in relation to these benefits to the people of the state of Idaho. That while the federal and state tax structures allow investments for insulation and alternative energy devices in income-producing property to be amortized or otherwise favorably treated, a need exists to encourage similar investments in nonincome-producing residential property.”

       If an individual taxpayer reports capital gain net income in determining Idaho taxable income, eighty percent (80%) in taxable year 2001 and sixty percent (60%) in taxable years thereafter of the capital gain net income from the sale or exchange of qualified property shall be a deduction in determining Idaho taxable income.

For this purpose, the adjusted basis shall be determined as provided in section 63-3022O, Idaho Code.
    (4) In determining the period for which property subject to this section has been held by a taxpayer, the provisions of section 1223 of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply, except that the holding period shall not include the holding period of property given up in an exchange, when such property would not have constituted qualified property under this section without regard to meeting the holding period nor shall the holding period include any time period in which the property subject to this section was held by a corporation other than an S corporation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the holding period of qualifying property that was distributed by an S corporation or an entity treated as a partnership to a person who was an owner, member or partner at the time of the distribution shall, for that person, include the amount of time that the S corporation or the entity held the property, regardless of whether the distribution was a liquidating distribution.

      <p>
       This section was amended by two 2001 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2001 amendment, by ch. 321, § 1, in subsection (1), deleted “net” following “amount of the”; inserted “net income” following “capital gain”; substituted “Gains”for “Net capital”; in subsection (f) deleted “when” following “except that”; substituted “shall not include” for “includes any period during which the taxpayer held property other than the property sold, all property held during”; substituted “of property given up in an exchange, when such property would not have constituted qualified property” for “must qualify”; added “without regard to meeting the holding period” following “under this section”; in subsection (5), inserted “or a capital gain from property acquired as a beneficiary of an estate” following “an estate”; in subsection (6), inserted “or a capital gain from property acquired as a beneficiary of a trust” following “from a trust”; and made stylistic changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2001 amendment, by ch. 323, § 1, in subsection (1), substituted “eighty percent (80%) in taxable year 2001 and sixty (60%) in taxable years thereafter of the net capital gain” for “sixty percent (60%) of the net capital gain from the sale or exchange.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2008 amendment, by ch. 313, rewrote the introductory paragraph in subsection (3), which formerly read: “As used in this section ‘qualified property’ means the following property having an Idaho situs at the time of sale”; in paragraph (3)(f), added “nor shall the holding period include any time period in which the property subject to this section was held by a corporation other than an S corporation”; deleted subsections (4) through (6), which pertained to reporting of capital gain; and redesignated former subsection (7) as subsection (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment, by ch. 5, added subsection (5).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was amended by three 2015 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2015 amendment, by ch. 41, added the last sentence in paragraph (3)(f).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2015 amendment, by ch. 70, added paragraph (3)(g).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2015 amendment, by ch. 269, rewrote subsection (5), which formerly read: “As used in this section the term ‘real property’ means land and other tangible property permanently upon or affixed to the land” and added subsection (6).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2016 amendment, by ch. 188, in subsection (3), deleted “if more than one-half (1/2) of the taxpayer’s gross income (as defined in section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) for the taxable year is from farming or ranching operations” preceding “in Idaho” in paragraphs (c) and (d) and deleted former paragraph (g), which read “When cattle, horses or breeding livestock were held and then sold by a pass-through entity, the requirement in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection, that more than one-half (1/2) of the taxpayer’s gross income for the taxable year be from farming or ranching operations in Idaho, shall apply to the activities of the pass-through entity. If more than one-half (1/2) of the pass-through entity’s gross income for the taxable year was from farming or ranching operations in Idaho, and the other requirements of this section are satisfied, then the capital gains deduction is available to the individual owners of an interest in the pass-through entity on their distributive share of the proceeds from the cattle, horse or breeding livestock sale”.
    The 2018 amendment, by ch. 186, added paragraph (3)(f), designated a portion of the existing provisions of subsection (3) as subsection (4), renumbering the subsequent subsections, and added subsection (8).

     <p>
      For taxable year 2001, and each taxable year thereafter, a tax measured by Idaho taxable income as defined in this chapter is hereby imposed upon every individual, trust, or estate required by this chapter to file a return.

     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t63c30s63-3024ol1a">
       The tax imposed upon individuals, trusts and estates shall be computed at the following rates:
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3024ol1b">
       In case a joint return is filed by husband and wife pursuant to the provisions of section 63-3031, Idaho Code, the tax imposed by this section shall be twice the tax which would be imposed on one-half (1/2) of the aggregate Idaho taxable income. For the purposes of this section, a return of a surviving spouse, as defined in section 2(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a head of household, as defined in section 2(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be treated as a joint return and the tax imposed shall be twice the tax which would be imposed on one-half (1/2) of the Idaho taxable income.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3024ol1c">
       In the case of a trust that is an electing small business trust as defined in section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code, the special rules for taxation of such trusts contained in section 641 of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply except that the maximum individual rate provided in this section shall apply in computing tax due under this chapter.
    (d) The state tax commission shall compute and publish Idaho income tax liability for taxpayers at the midpoint of each bracket of Idaho taxable income in fifty dollar ($50.00) steps to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), rounding such calculations to the nearest dollar. Taxpayers having income within such brackets shall file returns based upon and pay taxes according to the schedule thus established. The state tax commission shall promulgate rules defining the conditions upon which such returns shall be filed.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      When Idaho taxable income is:      The rate is:
     </p>
     <p>
      Less than $1,000      One and one hundred twenty-five thousandths percent (1.125%)
     </p>
     <p>
      $1,000 but less than $2,000      $11.25, plus three and one hundred twenty-five thousandths percent (3.125%) of the amount over $1,000
     </p>
     <p>
      $2,000 but less than $3,000      $42.50, plus three and six hundred twenty-five thousandths percent (3.625%) of the amount over $2,000
     </p>
     <p>
      $3,000 but less than $4,000      $78.75, plus four and six hundred twenty-five thousandths percent (4.625%) of the amount over $3,000

     <p>

     <p>
      $5,000 but less than $7,500      $181.25, plus six and six hundred twenty-five thousandths percent (6.625%) of the amount over $5,000

     </p>
     <p>
      For taxable year 2000 and each year thereafter, the state tax commission shall prescribe a factor which shall be used to compute the Idaho income tax brackets provided in subsection (a) of this section. The factor shall provide an adjustment to the Idaho tax brackets so that inflation will not result in a tax increase. The Idaho tax brackets shall be adjusted as follows: multiply the bracket amounts by the percentage (the consumer price index for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year to which the adjusted brackets will apply divided by the consumer price index for calendar year 1998). For the purpose of this computation, the consumer price index for any calendar year is the average of the consumer price index as of the close of the twelve (12) month period for the immediately preceding calendar year, without regard to any subsequent adjustments, as adopted by the state tax commission. This adoption shall be exempt from the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. The consumer price index shall mean the consumer price index for all U.S. urban consumers published by the United States department of labor. The state tax commission shall annually include the factor as provided in this subsection to multiply against Idaho taxable income in the brackets above to arrive at that year’s Idaho taxable income for tax bracket purposes.

    Section 1 of S.L. 1976, ch. 1, read: “Section 63-3024, Idaho Code, relating to taxes on income of individuals, trusts, and estates, and credits and refunds to resident individual taxpayers, has been amended continuously since it was first enacted in 1959. Section 63-3024, Idaho Code, was most recently amended by this legislature by Chapter 138 (House Bill No. 286) and Chapter 170 (Senate Bill No. 1054), Laws of 1975, wherein this legislature provided for certain credits or refunds to resident individual taxpayers. It was the intention of this legislature to provide for a credit against taxes and a refund of the balance of the unused credit if the credit exceeds the tax liability. A question has arisen, however, whether the text of Chapter 138, Laws of 1975, clearly expresses the intention of this legislature in this regard, and it is prudent that this legislature make its intention perfectly clear. The legislature by this act does not alter the original intent of the 1975 amendments to Section 63-3024, Idaho Code, but wished to state the law contained in that section clearly and free of ambiguity or misinterpretation.” Federal References.

        Former Regulation 14 (IDAPA 35.01.14) (1985) was a regulation that changed the provisions of this section to provide that a nonresident shall compute the tax on taxable income as required for Idaho residents under this section: this language had the effect of unlawfully striking from the statute, on a nonresident individual, the limitation on income derived from sources within the state of Idaho.

    The incorporation into the title of the language to the effect that the 1972 amendment of this section was intended to clarify the section “in accordance with previous intent” could not retroactively compel the courts to hold that the 1971 amendment did not accurately express the legislature’s intent, since there was no language in the 1972 amendment which affected the tax year 1971. Ware v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 98 Idaho 477, 567 P.2d 423 (1977).
       </p>

        The 1971 amendment to this section was not enacted irrationally and had no appearance of clerical error in its provisions regarding refunds to elderly taxpayers. Ware v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 98 Idaho 477, 567 P.2d 423 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the 1971 amended section all individual taxpayers were entitled to a $10.00 credit for each of their personal exemptions, but the 65-year-old taxpayer could have that credit and also obtain a $10.00 refund for each of the personal, 65 or over and blindness and dependents’ exemptions to which he was entitled.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state tax commission had no intention of allowing claims for refunds provided under the 1971 amendment to this section, the requirement of filing a claim for such refunds was a useless act and taxpayers who failed to file were entitled to obtain their refund.

Ware v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 98 Idaho 477, 567 P.2d 423 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiffs, who were taxpayers 65 years old or older, filed for a refund as provided for under the 1971 amendment to this section, they were entitled to the amounts they had claimed on their 1971 tax returns. Ware v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 98 Idaho 477, 567 P.2d 423 (1977).

       <p>
        Where the state tax commission, by passage of a regulation and promulgation of a form, foreclosed eligible claimants from requesting the refunds provided under the 1971 amendment to this section, the regulation and form contravened the express language of the statute and the taxpayers could not thus be denied the payment of the refund.

        The train crews’ presence in this state while traveling on transcontinental trains is not a sufficient nexus under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause of the United States Constitution to allow this state to subject the compensation they earn while traveling through this state to state income taxes; thus the application of this state’s income tax statutes to the income of train crews while traveling through this state is unconstitutional.

        Where a mutual fire insurance company accumulated a surplus of $432,095, which compared to an outstanding risk of $100,000,000 amounted to little more than .43 of 1% of such outstanding risk, and in order to write other kinds of insurance was required to maintain a surplus in excess of $300,000, such surplus was not excessive and did not disqualify the company from statutory exemption.

        The income referred to in subdivision (a)(1) of former section was income arising from the taxpayer’s trade or business which was conducted, in part at least, in this state; the state might have included as business income only the taxpayer’s income arising from a trade or business conducted in this state and was not entitled to apportion income arising from a trade or business having no connection with this state.

        Whether a number of business operations having common ownership constitute a single or unitary business or several separate businesses for tax purposes depends upon whether they are of mutual benefit to one another and on whether each operation is dependent on or contributory to others. This qualification, though not directly stated by the statute’s literal language, is required by the theory underlying apportionment statutes, i.e., that the business income of a unitary business operating in several states cannot be precisely identified with particular states, and by the constitutional requirement that there must be some minimal connection between the interstate business activities generating the income and the state seeking to tax that income. Albertson’s, Inc. v. State, Dep’t of Revenue, 106 Idaho 810, 683 P.2d 846 (1984).

        It was appropriate to treat the income of a Texas corporation, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Delaware corporation based in Idaho, as income of the parent corporation, subject to apportionment under this section, since the two corporations constituted a “unitary business.” Albertson’s, Inc. v. State, Dep’t of Revenue, 106 Idaho 810, 683 P.2d 846 (1984).

      (2) The income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      (s) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the state tax commission may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:
     </p>

      (1) Separate accounting, provided that only that portion of general expenses clearly identifiable with Idaho business operations shall be allowed as a deduction;
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in this state; or

      (1) The Idaho taxable income of any corporation subject to taxation in this state shall be determined by use of a combined report which includes the income, determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection, of all corporations which are members of a unitary business, allocated and apportioned using apportionment factors for all corporations included in the combined report and methods set out in this section. The use of a combined report does not disregard the separate corporate identities of the members of the unitary group. Each corporation which is transacting business in this state is responsible for its apportioned share of the combined business income plus its nonbusiness income or loss allocated to Idaho, minus its net operating loss carryover or carryback.

     <p>
      (2) The income of a corporation to be included in a combined report shall be determined as follows:

        Idaho tax commission’s motion for summary judgment was properly granted in a case involving corporate taxation because the commission met its burden of showing that the standard apportionment formula did not accurately reflect the business activities of a taxpayer inside of Idaho, and the double counting of certain sales constituted an “unusual fact situation” under Idaho Tax Comm’n R. 27, 4.18; an alternative apportionment formula that excluded certain sales was upheld as appropriate.

        Business income was defined as income arising from the transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer’s trade or business or income from the acquisition, management, or disposition of tangible and intangible property when such acquisition, management, or disposition constitute integral or necessary parts of the taxpayer’s trade or business operations, and since the trial court only considered the first definition in determining whether the taxpayer’s income from stock dividends related to the mining of soda ash constituted “business income,” remand was required to determine whether second definition applied.

        A resident of Washington, deriving his income from wages as conductor on a railroad, six miles of which was in Idaho and 141 miles of which was in Washington, properly allocated his income between Idaho and Washington, based upon the respective mileage and time spent by the taxpayer in the respective states. Gee v. West, 90 Idaho 173, 409 P.2d 116 (1965).
    Under subsection (r), the state tax commission was entitled to deviate from the income apportionment provisions of this section in cases where those provisions did not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in Idaho, and since taxpayer’s sale of accounts receivable included in “sales factor” of apportionment formula did not accurately reflect the taxpayer’s business activity in Idaho, remand was permissible to use an alternate formula that did reflect the taxpayer’s business activity. Union Pac. Corp. v. State Tax Comm’n, 136 Idaho 34, 28 P.3d 375 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in holding that the taxpayer’s proceeds from the sale of accounts receivables were “sales” pursuant to subsection (a)(5) and were properly includable in the “sales factor” when apportioning income to Idaho, because the state tax commission’s answers to the taxpayer’s requests for admission conceded that the transaction was a sale, but inclusion of that item in the sales factor caused the apportionment to unfairly reflect how the taxpayer earned its income in Idaho, and thus, remand was required to consider apportionment alternative. Union Pac. Corp. v. State Tax Comm’n, 136 Idaho 34, 28 P.3d 375 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving corporate taxation, a district court properly analyzed all three relevant factors in determining whether or not the standard apportionment formula fairly represented a taxpayer’s income; the case was proper for alternative apportionment based on the district court’s finding that the sales factor caused a per se unfair representation of the taxpayer’s Idaho income.

        Where railroad contended on appeal that subsection (s) of this section formed the basis upon which the trial court should have rejected the three part formula set out in subsections (i) through (o) of this section, which provide the method for determining what property qualifies for investment tax credit, the appeals court held, on de novo review, that because the stipulation between the railroad and the Idaho state tax commission contained no analysis of the allocation and apportionment provisions provided by this section, and that because the limited facts stipulated to by the parties contained nothing sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether the three part formula fairly represented the railroad’s activity in the state, it was proper for the district court to deny the railroad’s motion for summary judgment and to grant summary judgment in favor of the commission.

        A definition of “unitary business” that would permit nondomiciliary states to apportion and tax dividends where the business activities of the dividend payor have nothing to do with the activities of the recipient in the taxing state cannot be accepted consistently with due process standards.

        Idaho’s proposal that corporate purpose should define unitary business and that intangible income should be considered a part of a unitary business if the intangible property (the shares of stock) is “acquired, managed or disposed of for purposes relating or contributing to the taxpayer’s business” would destroy the very concept of defining unitary business, because, when pressed to its logical limit, this conception of the “unitary business” limitation becomes no limitation at all.

A taxpayer who makes a water’s-edge election shall take into account the income and apportionment factors of all affiliated corporations in a unitary relationship with the taxpayer, other than corporations filing elections under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, and which either file a federal income tax return under the Internal Revenue Code or are included in a federal consolidated return.

        The legislature in providing for the use of a writ of mandate to compel the filing of tax returns under this section obviously intended the statute to be read in pari materia to the general writ of mandate statute,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c03s7-301" target="_blank">§ 7-301 </a></cite>et seq.

       <p>
        The legislature did not intend the requirement of the general writ of mandate statute that there be no “plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law” to apply to the use of the writ under this section to compel the filing of tax returns.

        A writ of mandate is the proper remedy in a case where a person required to make an income tax return has not filed such a return. Idaho State Tax Comm’n v. Payton, 107 Idaho 258, 688 P.2d 1163 (1984); Idaho State Tax Comm’n v. Peterson, 107 Idaho 260, 688 P.2d 1165 (1984). Content of Return.
       </p>
       <p>
        The writ of mandate proceedings is not an appropriate proceeding in which to seek to control the contents of the return which is filed but if the court is to control the content of the return through the mandamus procedure, then before it can properly impose the extreme sanction of imprisonment for failing to obey the writ, the court issuing the writ must make specific findings as to the minimum figures which will be required to meet the demands of the writ and the writ itself should direct that at least those minimum figures be entered in certain spaces; in short, if the court issuing the writ is not going to allow the respondent to determine what figures should be entered in the spaces on the tax return, then the court should mandate the minimum figures which it will accept as constituting compliance with the writ. Mitchell v. Agents of State, 105 Idaho 419, 670 P.2d 520 (1983).

        The statutory directives that individuals must file income tax returns encompasses a requirement of disclosure of all information necessary for computation of the individual’s tax liability, as that liability is defined by statutory provisions and commission rules. Therefore regardless of whether Tax Form 40 should have been promulgated as an agency rule under the Administrative Procedure Act, defendant was obligated to file income tax returns that divulged the financial information necessary for calculation of his income tax, and writ of mandate compelling defendant to comply was proper. Idaho State Tax Comm’n v. Beacom, 131 Idaho 569, 961 P.2d 660 (Ct. App. 1998).

       <p>
        The legislature intended that the use of mandamus to compel the filing of tax returns should be a discovery proceeding, not an enforcement of payment proceeding; to require a showing as a predicate to issuance of the writ that the taxpayer has earned taxable income and the amount of his tax liability would in effect render the filing of a return redundant and would duplicate the enforcement provisions provided by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c30s63-3070" target="_self">§ 63-3070 </a></cite>(now repealed).

       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to its discovery purpose, the writ of mandate properly directs only the filing of a return in the form required by the tax laws and regulations and does not purport to mandate the content of the return in terms of the information to be furnished.

        Where the court found, as a predicate to issuance of the writ, that the taxpayer received a certain amount of gross wages for personal services from his employer for the two years in question, and that the returns he had theretofore filed provided no information concerning income, these findings supported the issuance of the writ of mandate.

        Section 3 of S.L. 1976, ch. 77, read: “This act designated as House Bill No. 378, and another act designated as House Bill No. 377, both amend section 63-3033, Idaho Code. It is not the intention of this legislature by this enactment to supersede or repeal the act designated as House Bill No. 377. The Idaho Code Commission is directed to compile both bills if enacted and approved, as amendments to section 63-3033, Idaho Code.”

        Section 5 of S.L. 1976, ch. 270, read: “This act designated as House Bill No. 377, and another act designated as House Bill No. 378, both amend section 63-3033, Idaho Code. It is not the intention of this legislature by this enactment to supersede or repeal the act designated as House Bill No. 378. The Idaho code commission is directed to compile both bills if enacted and approved, as amendments to section 63-3033, Idaho Code.” Therefore the above section incorporates both amendments. Chapter 77, § 1 in subsection (a) added clauses (2) and (3), deleted the words “except that” preceding “taxpayers residing or traveling outside” at the beginning of clause (4), deleted “(15th)” following “expire on the fifteenth” and “(6th)” following “of the sixth” and added subsection (b); chapter 270, § 1 in subsection (c) changed the interest rate from six per cent to eight per cent.

       </h3>
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t63c30s63-3035ol1a">
         Every employer who is required under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to withhold, collect and pay income tax on wages or salaries paid by such employer to any employee (other than employees specified in Internal Revenue Code section 3401(a)(2)) shall, at the time of such payment of wages, salary, bonus or other emolument to such employee, deduct and retain therefrom an amount substantially equivalent to the tax reasonably calculated by the state tax commission to be due from the employee under this chapter. The state tax commission shall prepare tables showing amounts to be withheld, and shall supply same to each employer subject to this section. In the event that an employer can demonstrate administrative inconvenience in complying with the exact requirements set forth in these tables, he may, with the consent of the state tax commission and upon application to it, use a different method which will produce substantially the same amount of taxes withheld. Every employer making payments of wages or salaries earned in Idaho, regardless of the place where such payment is made:
         <ol>
          <li id="t63c30s63-3035ol1a1">
           Shall be liable to the state of Idaho for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld under this section and shall not be liable to any individual for the amount deducted from his wages and paid over in compliance or intended compliance with this section;
          </li>
          <li id="t63c30s63-3035ol1a2">
           Must pay to the state tax commission monthly on or before the twentieth day of the succeeding month, or at such other times as the state tax commission may allow, an amount of tax which, under the provisions of this chapter, he is required to deduct and withhold;
          </li>
          <li id="t63c30s63-3035ol1a3">
           Shall register with the state tax commission, in the manner prescribed by it, to establish an employer’s withholding account number. The account number will be used to report all amounts withheld for the annual reconciliation required in this section, and for such other purposes relating to withholding as the state tax commission may require; and
          </li>
          <li id="t63c30s63-3035ol1a4">
           Must, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, if the amount of withholding of such employer for the preceding twelve (12) month period equals or exceeds two hundred forty thousand dollars ($240,000) per annum or an average of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) per month per annum, pay to the state tax commission on the basis of two (2) withholding periods. The first period shall begin on the first day of the month and end on the fifteenth day of the same month, and payment shall be made not later than the twentieth day of the same month. The second period shall begin on the sixteenth day of the same month and end on the last day of the same month, and payment shall be made not later than the fifth day of the following month. An employer meeting the withholding threshold requirements of this subsection, but only having one (1) pay period per month, may, upon request to and approval by the state tax commission, pay in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.

           If a payment required pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) of this subsection is not made or is made delinquently or if made is not equal to the withholding required under this section, the state tax commission may treat the failure as a failure to file a return and may take administrative and judicial actions as authorized by this chapter in the case of a failure to file a return. Interest, at the rate provided by section 63-3045, Idaho Code, shall apply to any such underpayment.
    (6) Commencing in 2006, the state tax commission shall determine whether the threshold amounts established by paragraph (4) of this subsection must be adjusted to reflect fluctuations in the cost of living. The state tax commission shall base its determination on the cumulative effect of the annual cost-of-living percentage modifications determined by the United States secretary of health and human services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 415(i). When the cumulative percentage applied to the monthly threshold amount equals or exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), the commission shall promulgate a rule adjusting the monthly threshold amount by five thousand dollars ($5,000) and making the necessary proportional adjustment to the annual threshold amount. The rule shall be effective for the next succeeding calendar year and each year thereafter until again adjusted by the commission. The tax commission shall determine subsequent adjustments in the same manner, in each case using the year of the last adjustment as the base year.

Such rules may provide a different due date for such returns, which shall be no later than the date employers are required to file such returns with the internal revenue service or the social security administration and shall provide a five (5) business day period for an employer to correct errors in the electronic file received by the due date.

Any employer who does not possess real property situated within the state of Idaho, which, in the opinion of the state tax commission, is of sufficient value to cover his probable tax liability, may be required to post a surety bond in such sum as the state tax commission shall deem adequate to protect the state.

Where the total amount so deducted exceeds the amount of tax on the employee, based on his Idaho taxable income, or where his income is not taxable under this chapter, the state tax commission shall, after examining the annual return filed by the employee in accordance with this chapter, but not later than sixty (60) days after the filing of each return, refund the amount of the excess deducted.

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1995 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 83, § 4, in subsection (b)(2) substituted “rules” for “regulations” and in subsection (e), following “three (3) years from the due date of his return”, inserted “, without regard to extensions,”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 111, § 32, in subsection (b)(2) also substituted “rules” for “regulations” and in subsection (e), in the second sentence, inserted “Idaho” preceding “taxable income” and following “taxable income” deleted “as computed under the provisions of this act, as the same has been or may hereafter be amended”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 195, rewrote the second sentence of subsection (b)(2), which formerly read: “Every employer who is required, under Internal Revenue Code section 6011, to file returns on magnetic media or in other machine readable form may be required by rules of the state tax commission to file corresponding state returns on similar magnetic media or other machine readable form.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 9, in the second sentence in subsection (b)(1), inserted “second”; added the paragraph (b)(1)(i) designation, and therein inserted “the amount of any deficiency due from the employer or refund payable by the state tax commission;” added paragraph (b)(1)(ii); in subsection (b)(2), deleted “and on or before the last day of February every employer shall file a copy thereof with the state tax commission” from the end; and added the subsection (b)(3) designation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 9, in paragraph (a)(4), substituted “two (2) withholding periods” for “withholding periods which begin on the 16th day of the month and end on the 15th day of the following month, and payment shall be made not later than five (5) days after the end of the withholding period”at the end of the first sentence and added the last two sentences.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2016 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 12, in subsection (a), added the last sentence in paragraph (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 31, in subsection (b), “and shall provide a five (5) business day period for an employer to correct errors in the electronic file received by the due date” at the end of paragraph (3).
       </p>

        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 195, deleted the “(1)” designation from the first paragraph; redesignated former subsections (1)(a) to (c) as present subsections (1) to (3); and deleted former subsections (2) and (3), which read: “(2) A tax assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer along with an identification of the taxpayer, the character of the liability assessed, the taxable period, if applicable, and the amount of the assessment. The assessment shall be kept and maintained in a record in the office of the state tax commission in accordance with rules prescribed by the tax commission. Upon request of the taxpayer, the tax commission shall furnish the taxpayer a copy of the record of assessment. No tax commission activities to enforce collection of tax may be conducted, nor may a proceeding to collect a tax be instituted, until assessment of the tax has been made in accordance with the provisions of this section. Taxes and related interest may be assessed immediately upon receipt of a tax return, amended return or other consent signed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s authorized representative showing the taxes due. The tax commission may presume that the signature is the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s authorized representative until the contrary is established by a preponderance of the evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The making of an assessment is not required before the tax commission may conduct audits and investigations or make inquiries of taxpayers or other persons relating to matters within the tax commission’s jurisdiction. The making of an assessment is not required before the tax commission may file a judicial action under section 63-3030A or 63-3064, Idaho Code, or actions for injunctive or declaratory relief.”

In the case of a return properly filed without the computation of the tax, the tax computed by the state tax commission shall be deemed to be assessed on the date when payment is due” from the beginning of present subsection (1)(c); divided present subsection (1)(d) as the introductory paragraph in (1)(d) and (1)(d)(i); inserted “or the board of tax appeals” in present subsection (1)(d)(i); added subsection (1)(d)(ii) and subsections (2) to (4).

        Where paging service sought opinion of office of tax collector and was directed to tax commission employee and received an opinion indicating that no tax was owed on paging unit provided to customers, and the office of tax collector and its successor, the tax commission, followed the practice of not taxing the lease of pagers from 1965 until 1993 when it adopted regulations addressing this type of transaction, these regulations could not change the meaning of the legislation which has not changed since 1965; therefore, paging service was not negligent to continue to rely on advice received in 1965 which was in fact the policy of the tax commission for some 18 years following and penalties imposed by the tax commission pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c34s63-3406" target="_self">§ 63-3406</a></cite>(a) should have been waived.

        Since imposition of the nonfiler penalty is discretionary and is not conditioned on any degree of culpability of the taxpayer, it was an abuse of discretion to punish a taxpayer for relying on the written opinion of an employee of the office of tax collector setting forth the position of the taxing authority which in fact was followed for nearly two decades, taking into account that the applicable statute had never been amended.

       Redetermination by the state tax commission may be reviewed in the district court for Ada county or the county in which the taxpayer resides or has his principal office or place of business by a complaint filed by the taxpayer against the state tax commission within ninety-one (91) days after the receipt of notice of the decision of the state tax commission denying, in whole or in part, any protest of the taxpayer or, within the same period, by filing an appeal with the board of tax appeals. Upon the serving of summons upon the state tax commission the case shall proceed as other civil cases but may be heard by the judge in chambers. If the case is appealed to the board of tax appeals, the hearing before that body shall proceed as set forth in the act creating such board.

Any taxes, penalties or interest paid, found by the court to be in excess of that which can be legally assessed, shall be ordered refunded to the taxpayer with interest from the time of payment. In the case of sales or use tax and corporate income tax decisions by the state tax commission, when the amount asserted exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), no appeal to the board of tax appeals shall be allowed.

        Taxpayer argued that a portion of the $42,684 payment (regarding taxes assessed on a sale of a partnership) should also have been applied to the 20 percent deposit required to challenge the redetermination that she owed additional taxes because of the commission’s disallowance of the like-kind exchange; however, neither in the taxpayer’s letter, nor at any later time, did the taxpayer direct that any portion of the $42,684 payment could be applied to the deposit required to appeal that issue. Section 63-4007 required the commission to apply the payment as directed, and it could not apply a portion of that payment to some other tax obligation, nor could it apply it to the 20 percent deposit required to appeal the redetermination regarding the like-kind exchange as required by subsection (b) of this section.

        Administrative garnishments to collect tax deficiencies do not violate a taxpayer’s right to due process if the taxpayer has been provided notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard concerning the assessed deficiency. Where the defendant instituted the action to enjoin the state tax commission from collecting an income tax deficiency assessed against him nearly nine months after the expiration of his right to judicial review, the defendant was afforded due process, but failed to timely exercise his right to seek judicial review.

        Former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c36s63-3632" target="_self">§ 63-3632</a></cite>(a) allowed a taxpayer either to file an appeal with the board of tax appeals or to file a complaint with the district court, in accordance with this section, for a review of the state tax commission’s redetermination. The record was clear that taxpayer opted to file an appeal with the board within the time permitted, rather than filing a complaint with the district court. In granting taxpayer’s motion for reconsideration, the district court attempted to treat taxpayer’s appeal to the board as the filing of a complaint with the district court. In effect, the district court extended the time within which taxpayer might file a complaint with the district court for a review of the commission’s redetermination; the district court did not have jurisdiction to do so. Grand Canyon Dories, Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 121 Idaho 515, 826 P.2d 476 (1992) (decision prior to 1993 amendment of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c36s63-3632" target="_self">§ 63-3632</a></cite>).

        Where a taxpayer seeking to recover state income taxes had complied with the statute relating to a review of the action of the commissioner, the fact that the action was brought under the Declaratory Judgment Statute rather than as a suit to determine by review the action of the commissioner did not impose an additional burden upon the commissioner; relief would not be denied on the ground that the taxpayer’s suit should have been one to review the action of the commissioner in refusing the refund.

     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t63c30s63-3068ol1a">
       Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of deficiency, as provided in section 63-3045, Idaho Code, for the tax imposed in this chapter shall be issued within three (3) years from either the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or from the date the return was filed, whichever is later.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3068ol1b">
       If an assessment has been made as provided in this chapter, then such tax shall be collected either by levy, or by a proceeding brought in court, within a period of twelve (12) years from the date of entry of the record of assessment required by section 63-3045A, Idaho Code, of the tax and provided, further, that this shall not be in derogation of any of the remedies elsewhere provided in this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3068ol1c">
       In the case of a fraudulent return or a false return with the intent to evade the tax imposed in this chapter, or a willful attempt in any manner to defeat or evade the tax imposed in this chapter, a notice of deficiency may be issued, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3068ol1d">
       In the case of a failure to file a return, for any reason, a notice of deficiency may be issued, the tax imposed in this chapter may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3068ol1e">
       In the case of income received during the lifetime of a decedent, or by his estate during the period of administration, a notice of deficiency shall be issued, a claim shall be made, the tax shall be assessed or any proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun, within twelve (12) months after written request for prompt action is filed with the state tax commission by the executor, administrator, or other fiduciary representing the estate of such decedent. This subsection shall not apply if the return for which the request for prompt action relates has not been filed with the state tax commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3068ol1f">
       When Idaho taxable income or tax credits for any taxable year have been adjusted as a result of a final federal determination, the period of limitation for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be reopened and shall not expire until the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery of the final federal determination to the state tax commission by the taxpayer, three (3) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or three (3) years from the date the return was filed. For purposes of this subsection the term “final federal determination” shall mean the final resolution of all issues which were adjusted by the internal revenue service. When the final federal determination is submitted, the taxpayer shall also submit copies of all schedules and written explanations provided by the internal revenue service. Upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits which were adjusted in the final federal determination shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c30s63-3068ol1g">
       If an adjustment, which was made within the period of limitations as provided in this section, affects the amount of tax credit, net operating loss, or capital loss, claimed in a taxable year other than the tax year in which the adjustment is made, then adjustments to the credit, net operating loss, or capital loss claimed in such other tax year may be made and a resulting notice of deficiency may be issued even though such notice of deficiency would otherwise be barred under the provisions of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, when an amended Idaho return is filed within the period of limitations as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be three (3) years from the date the amended return was filed. However, upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted in the amended Idaho return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.

         If a taxpayer has filed an amended federal return, and no corresponding Idaho amended return has been filed with the state tax commission, then the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be reopened and shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of delivery to the tax commission by the taxpayer of the amended federal return. However, upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, then only those specific items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted in the amended federal return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.

     </ol>
     <p>
      (j) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a notice of deficiency, related to items on the return of any pass-through entity, as defined in this section, which other taxpayers are required by law to report, shall be issued to such other taxpayers within the later of three (3) years from the due date of the other taxpayers’ return, without regard to extensions, three (3) years from the date the other taxpayers’ returns were filed, or three (3) years from the date of filing of the pass-through entity’s return. If the pass-through entity files an amended return, notices of deficiency may be issued to the other taxpayers within three (3) years from the date the amended return for the pass-through entity was filed with the state tax commission. If the pass-through entity files an amended return with the internal revenue service, or the internal revenue service issues a final determination to the pass-through entity, then the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers shall be reopened and shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of delivery to the tax commission by the pass-through entity of the amended federal return or the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery to the state tax commission by the pass-through entity of the final federal determination, three (3) years from the due date of the pass-through entity’s return, without regard to extensions, or three (3) years from the date the pass-through entity’s return was filed.
     </p>
     <p>
      (k) For purposes of this section, “pass-through entity” means a partnership, S corporation, trust, limited liability company or any other entity whose items of income, deductions, gains, losses and credits must be reported by other taxpayer(s). For further purposes of this section, the term “other taxpayer” shall include, by way of unlimiting example, such taxpayers as partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, joint venturers or investors.
     </p>
     <p>
      (
    l
    ) In the case of a duplicate return filed under section 63-217(1)(b), Idaho Code, the limitation under this section shall be the later of one (1) year from the filing of the duplicate return or the date otherwise applicable under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (m) Prior to the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the issuance of a notice of deficiency for the tax imposed in this chapter, both the state tax commission, its delegate or deputy, and the taxpayer may consent in writing to extend the period of time within which a notice of deficiency may be issued. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. When a pass-through entity extends the period of limitations in accordance with this subsection, the period of limitations for the other taxpayers is automatically extended for the same period for the purpose of issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers reflecting the adjustments to the pass-through entity’s return.
     </p>
     <p>
      (n) The expiration of the period of limitations as provided in this section shall be suspended for the time period during which the state tax commission is prohibited from issuing a notice of deficiency, making the assessment, or from collecting by levy or a proceeding in court, and for thirty (30) days thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      (o) For the purposes of this section, “return” includes a notice of deficiency determination issued by the state tax commission when no return was filed by the taxpayer. Such a return is deemed filed on the date the taxes determined by the state tax commission are assessed.

      The state tax commission may be made a party defendant in a civil action by any person aggrieved under this chapter or any other chapter in which this section is expressly incorporated by reference by the unlawful seizure or sale of his property, or in any suit for refund or to recover an overpayment, but only the state of Idaho shall be responsible for any final money judgment secured against the state tax commission, and said judgment shall be paid or satisfied out of the state refund fund created by section 63-3067, Idaho Code. No seizure or sale shall be considered unlawful if it occurs in the collection of any deficiency which was included in the person’s tax return or asserted in a notice of deficiency determination pursuant to section 63-3045 or 63-3629, Idaho Code, or in a jeopardy assessment pursuant to the provisions of section 63-3629 or 63-3065, Idaho Code.

        This statute does not authorize a tort claim, but provides a limited, remedial measure enabling taxpayers to challenge a wrongful collection of taxes or the various enforcement actions of the commission, including the seizure of property.

        In action by taxpayer for trespass on his land and unlawful seizure of his property, where, although taxpayer did not cite this section in his complaint, the allegations in the complaint clearly stated a cause of action under it, the pleadings were sufficient to raise the question of unlawful seizure of the property under this section, since Idaho R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1) requires only a simple, concise and direct statement fairly appraising the defendant of the claims and grounds upon which the claims contained in the complaint rest. Greenwade v.

     <p>
      Any taxing district shall have power from time to time by resolution to borrow money and issue revenue anticipation bonds or notes, bearing interest at such rate as may be determined by the governing board, and maturing not more than one (1) year from the date thereof, for the purpose of providing funds in anticipation of the collection of taxes of the current fiscal year, in anticipation of the distribution of state appropriated funds, and in anticipation of other revenues of any nature, for the year in which said revenue anticipation bonds or notes are issued, exclusive of taxes required to be raised to pay the principal of outstanding bonded indebtedness of the taxing district, the proceeds of such bonds or notes to be used for the purpose for which said taxes are levied or such funds or other revenues are appropriated. The amount authorized to be borrowed by means of such revenue anticipation bonds or notes shall not exceed seventy-five per cent (75%) of the taxes levied for the current fiscal year and not yet collected by said taxing district, seventy-five per cent (75%) of the anticipated distribution from the public school income fund not yet collected for the current fiscal year, and seventy-five per cent (75%) of other revenues anticipated, as shown by the budget duly adopted by the taxing district and certified in accordance with section 63-804, Idaho Code, and not yet collected for the fiscal year. If the tax levy or budget for any fiscal year has not been completed, then the amount of revenue anticipation bonds or notes issued in anticipation of taxes, state funds, or other revenues to be levied for such fiscal year shall not exceed seventy-five per cent (75%) of the taxes levied or state funds or other revenues received by said taxing district in the previous fiscal year. In determining the amount of revenue anticipation bonds or notes which may be issued, the governing body shall declare in the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or notes the amount of taxes levied or state funds or other revenues anticipated for the current fiscal year and the amount of such taxes or state funds or other revenues anticipated not yet collected by said taxing district, or in the event that the tax levy or budget for the fiscal year has not been completed, the governing authority shall declare in the resolution providing for the issuance of such revenue anticipation bonds or notes the amount of taxes levied or state funds or other revenues received by said taxing district in the previous fiscal year. In each instance, taxes raised or to be raised to pay the principal of outstanding bonded indebtedness of the taxing district shall not be included in the amount of taxes or state funds or other revenues anticipated against which such revenue anticipation bonds or notes are authorized to be issued. Such revenue anticipation bonds or notes shall be negotiable instruments, and the full faith, credit and resources of the taxing district shall be pledged for the payment of the same. Such bonds or notes shall be issued in such form and detail as shall be determined by the governing authority of the taxing district by resolution duly adopted.

      To provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on tax anticipation notes there is hereby created a special fund to be known as the “Tax Anticipation Note Redemption Fund.” Whenever any tax anticipation notes have been issued in anticipation of income or revenue from taxes as authorized and directed by this chapter, all income or revenue realized from the taxes which were specified in the approved plan of financing to be anticipated shall be placed in the tax anticipation note redemption fund until such time as the funds accumulated therein shall be sufficient to pay the principal amount of all such notes outstanding, together with interest thereon until paid; and the funds so accumulated in the redemption fund are hereby appropriated and set aside solely for such purposes; provided, however, except as otherwise provided in the constitution of the state of Idaho nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the payment of the principal and interest of tax anticipation notes solely to the income and revenues from the specific taxes in anticipation of which the notes were issued. Accrued interest received upon the sale of the tax anticipation notes shall be deposited by the state treasurer in the redemption fund. The state treasurer is authorized to invest all moneys from time to time in the redemption fund in any authorized investment of the state treasurer maturing at a time or times which will permit payment of the principal of and interest on the tax anticipation notes in a timely manner when due. The state treasurer is authorized to covenant with the purchasers of the tax anticipation notes as to the manner of holding moneys in the redemption fund, the investments of moneys in the redemption fund and the disposition of any investment income therefrom either by retaining investment income in the redemption fund to be used to pay principal of and interest on tax anticipation notes when due or by paying the investment income to the state treasurer for deposit into the general account in the operating fund of the state; provided, however, whenever there is sufficient money in the redemption fund to pay all principal of and interest on all outstanding tax anticipation notes payable therefrom, all investment income thereon must be paid to the state treasurer for deposit into the general account in the state operating fund of the state.

      Every producer of electricity by means of wind energy, by means of solar energy or by means of geothermal energy in this state shall file with the state tax commission of the state of Idaho an operator’s statement in the manner as provided for in section 63-404, Idaho Code, and shall include thereon a statement of the prior calendar year’s gross wind energy earnings, gross solar energy earnings or gross geothermal energy earnings. Upon examining and verifying said statement, the state tax commission shall compute the amount of the wind energy tax, solar energy tax or the geothermal energy tax based on the gross wind energy earnings, gross solar energy earnings or the gross geothermal energy earnings and shall allot to each county in which the property of such producer is situated, and otherwise exempted from taxation by section 63-602JJ, Idaho Code, either: that proportion of the total wind energy tax, that proportion of the total solar energy tax or that proportion of the total geothermal energy tax of such producer shown to be due as the same proportion that the total original cost of property situated in such county, and otherwise exempted from taxation by section 63-602JJ, Idaho Code, bears to the total original cost of such property of such producer for the wind energy project, of such producer for the solar energy project or of such producer for the geothermal energy project. The state tax commission shall then, for each county, apportion the wind energy tax, solar energy tax or geothermal energy tax so allotted to such county among the several taxing units thereof within which any property of such producer is situated, and otherwise exempted from taxation by section 63-602JJ, Idaho Code, by apportioning to each such taxing unit that proportion of the wind energy tax, solar energy tax or geothermal energy tax so allotted to such county. For such apportionment, the state tax commission shall calculate the weighted original cost which shall be the product of the original cost of such property within such taxing unit times such taxing unit’s property tax levy for the prior year and the weighted apportionment rate which shall be the ratio of the wind energy tax, of the solar energy tax or of the geothermal energy tax, as the case may be, allotted to such county, to the aggregate weighted original cost for all such taxing units within which the property is located and then shall calculate the apportionment of the wind energy tax, solar energy tax or geothermal energy tax for each such taxing unit to be equal to the product of the weighted original cost times the weighted apportionment rate. The state tax commission shall, on or before the third Monday in May, notify the state superintendent of public instruction, the county auditor, and the county treasurer of such allotment and apportionment and the amounts thereof. On or before the first Monday in August, the county auditor shall notify the appropriate taxing units of the amount of wind energy tax, the amount of solar energy tax or the amount of the geothermal energy tax being apportioned and the amount of the solar energy tax distributed to each of these taxing units during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding July 1 of the current tax year.

        Since there was no evidence of any agreement between the multiple listing service and the real estate broker regarding transfer of title, title to the multiple listing booklets was transferred to the real estate broker upon delivery. The transfer was “for a consideration”; thus, there was a sale of the multiple listing booklets by the multiple listing service to the real estate broker. This sale was a “sale at retail” since real estate broker had no intention of reselling those books and, in fact, was prohibited from doing so by the bylaws of the multiple listing service. Old W.

        Pager units supplied by radio paging service were subject to sales tax, as such pagers were not merely incidental to the service transaction, but were a mixed transaction imposing tax liability on the rental portion of the transaction, as the initial agreement between paging service and its customers set forth a separate charge ranging between 25% and 40% of the total monthly charge as a fee for leasing the pager; thus the paging service owed sales tax on rental receipts derived from the transfer of paging units to its customers.

        The sales tax on prefabricated homes was based on the value of materials used in construction and not on the sale price of the homes themselves, where the manufacturer of prebuilt homes contracted to construct buildings according to customers’ specifications, transported the completed homes to the customers’ properties, attached the homes to foundations and then transferred title to the customers.

It was at the point of sale that the purchaser obtained the privilege of using the ski lifts and it was the sales transaction, and not the activity of using the ski lifts that was the taxable event; consequently, the receipts collected from sales of ski lift tickets within the cities’ geographical boundaries were subject to taxation under the local ordinances and subsection (2)(f) of this section.

        Where the local ordinances’ provisions imposing a sales tax on the sale of ski tickets, specifically refer to receipts received by the vendor of the ski lift tickets and do not focus on a specific activity to trigger the taxable event, it is the sales transaction from which the receipt is received and not the activity of using the ski lifts that is the event subject to taxation under subsection (f) of this section and the corresponding local ordinances, and since the taxable event takes place within the jurisdiction and geographical boundaries of the localities, the sales tax ordinances do not violate Const., Art. 12, § 2.

        The City of Sun Valley may impose its local option sales tax on building materials sales made in the city. For the sale of goods, a sale is in the city when title passes either when provided by contract between the parties or, if there is no express contractual provision, when the seller completes his responsibilities regarding delivery of the product sold. In no case does title pass before identification of specific goods to the sale. When delivery of building materials occurs in the City of Sun Valley and there is no specific provision in the sales contract to the contrary, title passes at the time of delivery which is the time of sale; if the seller is a retailer required to have a city sales tax permit, the city may require the seller to collect city sales tax on the sale and remit the tax to the city.<cite class="OAG">OAG 91-6</cite>.

If such a deduction is taken by the retailer, no refund or credit will be allowed to his vendor with respect to the sale of the property.

     </h3>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t63c36s63-3616ol1a">
       The term “tangible personal property” means personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c36s63-3616ol1b">
       The term “tangible personal property” includes any computer software except the following: custom computer programs; computer software that is delivered electronically; remotely accessed computer software; and computer software that is delivered by the load and leave method where the vendor or its agent loads the software at the user’s location but does not transfer any tangible personal property containing the software to the user. As used in this subsection, the term “remotely accessed computer software” means computer software that a user accesses over the internet, over private or public networks, or through wireless media, where the user has only the right to use or access the software by means of a license, lease, subscription, service or other agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing exclusions of certain types of computer software from the definition of tangible personal property, tangible personal property shall include computer software that constitutes digital music, digital books, digital videos and digital games when the purchaser has a permanent right to use such software and, regardless of the method of delivery or access. If the right to use digital music, digital books, digital videos or digital games is conditioned upon continued payment from the purchaser it is not a permanent right of use.
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t63c36s63-3616ol1bi">
         As used in this subsection, the term “computer software” means any computer program, part of a program or any sequence of instructions for automatic data processing equipment or information stored in an electronic medium.

        <li id="t63c36s63-3616ol1bii">
         As used in this subsection, the term “custom computer program” means any computer software, as defined in this subsection, which is written or prepared exclusively for a customer and includes those services represented by separately stated charges for the modification of existing prewritten programs when the modifications are written or prepared exclusively for a customer. The term does not include a “canned” or prewritten program which is held or existing for general or repeated sale, lease or license, even if the program was initially developed on a custom basis or for in-house use. Modification to an existing prewritten program to meet the customer’s needs is custom computer programming only to the extent of the modification, and only to the extent that the actual amount charged for the modification is separately stated on invoices, statements, and other billing documents supplied to the purchaser.

The provisions of this act are hereby declared to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this act.”

        Section 25 of S.L. 2006 (1st E.S.), ch. 1, provides: “The Legislature finds and declares that the issue of the property tax funding maintenance and operations of public schools is of importance to the citizens of the state of Idaho. As a representative body, members of the Legislature desire to be responsive and responsible to these citizens. For this reason, the Legislature herewith submits an advisory ballot to the electors of the state of Idaho, and the results will guide the Legislature as to whether the three-tenths of one percent property tax previously contained in Section 33-802, Idaho Code, and levied against the market value of taxable property in the school districts for maintenance and operation purposes of school districts should continue to be removed and the funds be replaced by a sufficient increase in the state sales tax.

       <p>
        “The Secretary of State shall have the question below placed on the 2006 general election ballot and shall take necessary steps to have the results on the question tabulated. The question shall be as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Should the State of Idaho keep the property tax relief adopted in August 2006, reducing property taxes by approximately $260 million and protecting funding for public schools by keeping the sales tax at 6%?.’
       </p>

        “The advisory question provided for in this act is hereby declared to be a ‘measure’ for purposes of Chapter 66, Title 67, Idaho Code, and the provisions of Chapter 66, Title 67, Idaho Code, shall apply thereto.”

      A seller may accept a resale certificate from a purchaser prior to the time of sale, at the time of sale, or at any reasonable time after the sale when necessary to establish the privilege of the exemption. The resale certificate relieves the person selling the property from the burden of proof only if taken from a person who is engaged in the business of selling or renting tangible personal property and who holds the permit provided for by section 63-3620, Idaho Code, or who is a retailer not engaged in business in this state, and who, at the time of purchasing the tangible personal property, intends to sell or rent it in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of purchase whether the property will be sold or will be used for some other purpose. Other than as provided elsewhere in this section, when a resale certificate, properly executed, is presented to the seller, the seller has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard to any sales transaction so documented regardless of whether the purchaser properly or improperly claimed an exemption. A seller so relieved of the obligation to collect tax is also relieved of any liability to the purchaser for failure to collect tax or for making any report or disclosure of information required or permitted under this chapter.
    The resale certificate shall bear the name and address of the purchaser, shall be signed by the purchaser or his agent, shall indicate the number of the permit issued to the purchaser, or that the purchaser is an out-of-state retailer, and shall indicate the general character of the tangible personal property sold by the purchaser in the regular course of business. The certificate shall be substantially in such form as the state tax commission may prescribe.

As a representative body, members of the Legislature desire to be responsive and responsible to these citizens. For this reason, the Legislature herewith submits an advisory ballot to the electors of the state of Idaho, and the results will guide the Legislature as to whether the three-tenths of one percent property tax previously contained in Section 33-802, Idaho Code, and levied against the market value of taxable property in the school districts for maintenance and operation purposes of school districts should continue to be removed and the funds be replaced by a sufficient increase in the state sales tax.

       </p>
       <p>
        “Should the State of Idaho keep the property tax relief adopted in August 2006, reducing property taxes by approximately $260 million and protecting funding for public schools by keeping the sales tax at 6%?.’

       To prevent evasion of the sales and use tax, it shall be presumed that all sales are subject to the taxes imposed by the provisions of this chapter and the retailer shall have the burden of establishing the facts giving rise to such exemption unless the purchaser delivers to the retailer, or has on file with the retailer, an exemption or resale certificate.

      <li id="t63c36s63-3622ol1b">
       An exemption certificate shall show the purchaser’s name, business name and address (if any), address, and signature and the reason for and nature of the claimed exemption.

       A resale certificate shall be signed by and bear the name and address of the purchaser or his agent, shall indicate the number of the permit issued to the purchaser or that the purchaser is an out-of-state retailer, and shall indicate the general character of the tangible personal property sold or rented by the purchaser in the regular course of business. A resale certificate relieves the seller from the burden of proof only if taken from a person who is engaged in the business of selling or renting tangible personal property and who holds a permit provided for in this section, or who is a retailer not engaged in business in this state, and who, at the time of purchasing the tangible personal property, intends to sell or rent it in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of purchase whether the property will be sold or will be used for some other purpose. If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate makes any use of the property other than retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale or rent in the regular course of business, the use shall be taxable to the purchaser as of the time the property is first used by him, and the sales price of the property to him shall be deemed the measure of the tax.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c36s63-3622ol1d">
       A seller may accept an exemption or resale certificate from a purchaser prior to the time of sale, at the time of the sale, or at any reasonable time after the sale when necessary to establish the privilege of the exemption. Other than as provided elsewhere in this section, when an exemption or resale certificate, properly executed, is presented to or is on file with the seller, the seller has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard to any sales transaction so documented regardless of whether the purchaser properly or improperly claimed an exemption. A seller so relieved of the obligation to collect tax is also relieved of any liability to the purchaser for failure to collect tax or for making any report or disclosure of information required or permitted under this chapter. A seller need not accept an exemption or resale certificate that is not readable, legible or copyable.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c36s63-3622ol1e">
       Any person who gives an exemption or resale certificate with the intention of evading payment of the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction is guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c36s63-3622ol1f">
       An exemption or resale certificate shall be substantially in such form as the state tax commission may prescribe. The claim for the exemption may be a part of the documentation on a sales invoice, purchase order, or other documentation retained by the retailer with regard to the sale. Unless the purchaser has an exemption or resale certificate on file with the seller, the purchaser or his agent must sign the exemption claim, which shall be in addition to any other signature which the seller normally requires on sales invoices, purchase orders, or other sales documentation.
    (g) It shall be presumed that sales made to a person who has completed an exemption or resale certificate for the seller’s records are not taxable and the seller need not collect sales or use taxes unless the tangible personal property or services purchased are taxable to the purchaser as a matter of law in the particular instance claimed on the exemption certificate.

        Section 1 of S.L. 1987, ch. 18 read: “Statement of Intent. It is the intention of the legislature by this act to reconcile and clarify any statutory conflicts which may have resulted from the enactment by the Second Regular Session of the Forty-seventh Idaho Legislature in 1984 of four acts relating to exemptions from sales tax. These acts were Chapter 239 (H.B. 680), Chapter 119 (H.B. 664), Chapter 195 (H.B. 586), and Chapter 287 (H.B. 699), Laws of 1984. The purpose of this act is to repeal Section 63-3622, Idaho Code, as amended by Chapters 119, 195 and 287, Laws of 1984 and by Chapters 30, 120 and 180, Laws of 1986. Section 63-3622, Idaho Code, as amended by Chapter 239, Laws of 1984, is to be retained and is hereby ratified. Changes to sales tax exemptions not reflected in Chapter 239, Laws of 1984 are, by this act, to be restated in the new code sections enacted by Chapter 239, Laws of 1984.”

        Machinery, equipment and materials used to manufacture, construct and fabricate other machinery, to be used for manufacturing purposes, is directly and primarily used to produce a final product for retail sale and is, therefore, exempt pursuant to the production exemption.

        The production exemption will apply when a business primarily devoted to manufacturing undertakes to manufacture and fabricate its own manufacturing equipment for use in its manufacturing process; any tangible personal property or equipment used or consumed in the manufacturing or fabricating operation, either in the manufacture of the final product or some integrated, continuous segment thereof, including the construction and installation of the manufacturing equipment, will be exempt from the use and sales tax unless it is specifically prohibited by some other provision.

        There was no evidence indicating the independent contractors were a business or segment of a business primarily devoted to production operations; accordingly, defendants failed to show that the contractors qualified for the production exemption.

       <p>
        Although business’ primary source of revenue is derived from the sale of wood and wood products, the leased machinery used to transform steel or other materials into the machinery that will directly be used to transform the raw wood would be exempt when used by a business that is primarily devoted to production operations; the entire manufacturing process involved in the operation is an integrated and continuous part of producing the final product for ultimate retail sale. Idaho State Tax Comm’n v. Haener Bros., 121 Idaho 741, 828 P.2d 304 (1992) (decision under former similar law).
    Business was a manufacturer of wood and wood products in a business primarily devoted to manufacturing and did not deal with the final consumer of its products or run a retail operation; thus, any leased equipment, or materials used or consumed by business in the manufacturing process, whether it be the manufacture of wood products or the fabrication and manufacturing of tangible personal property used to manufacture the wood or wood products, is exempt from the sales tax unless another exclusion applies. Idaho State Tax Comm’n v. Haener Bros., 121 Idaho 741, 828 P.2d 304 (1992) (decision under former similar law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a significant segment of business activity was devoted to the fabrication and manufacture of its own wood and wood product manufacturing equipment, and since fabrication includes installation of manufacturing equipment, i.e., to unite the parts, the equipment and material used to produce and fabricate the final product in the manufacturing process should also be exempt under this section; leased installation equipment and materials are “primarily and directly used” in integrating the separate parts into the manufacturing system for final use. Idaho State Tax Comm’n v. Haener Bros., 121 Idaho 741, 828 P.2d 304 (1992) (decision under former similar law).

        Where a rock crushing operation was a segment of road paving company’s business, which segment was primarily engaged in crushing rocks into gravel for use in cement mixing and ultimate sale by concrete company, the rock crushing machine was not primarily engaged in crushing rock for road paving; rather, the primary purpose of the rock crusher was to crush for ultimate retail sale. That purpose qualified the crusher and all repair parts and equipment for the production tax exemption under former subdivision (1) of this section. Central Paving Co. v.

        The production exemption exempts tangible personal property that is primarily and directly used in the production process by a business or segment of a business primarily devoted to production operations; this does not require that the materials, equipment and property used in the production process must directly touch or be actually contained in the final product; the language “primarily and directly” only means that the materials and personal property must play a primary and direct role in making the final product marketable.

     <p>
      The state tax commission, whenever it deems it necessary to insure compliance with this act, may require any person subject to this act to place with it such security as it may determine. The amount of the necessary security shall be fixed by the state tax commission but, except as provided hereafter, shall not be greater than three (3) times the estimated average monthly amount payable by such persons pursuant to this act or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), whichever amount is the lesser. In the case of persons habitually delinquent in their obligations under this act, the amount of the security shall not be greater than five (5) times the estimated average monthly amount payable by such persons pursuant to this act or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), whichever is the lesser. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the state tax commission at any time, subject to the limitations above set forth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state tax commission may sell the security at public auction or, in the case of security in the form of bearer bonds issued by the United States or the state of Idaho which have a prevailing market price, at a private sale at a price not lower than the prevailing market price if it becomes necessary to make such sale in order to recover any tax, interest or penalties due on any amount required to be collected. Notice of the sale must be given to the person who deposited the security at least ten (10) days before the sale; such notice may be given personally or by mail addressed to the person at the address furnished to the state tax commission and as it appears in the records of the state tax commission. Upon such sale, any surplus above the amounts due shall be returned to the person who placed the security.

      If the state tax commission finds that a taxpayer is about to depart from the state of Idaho or to remove his property therefrom, or to conceal himself or his property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partially ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax for the taxable period or any taxes unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the state tax commission shall thereupon make a determination of the tax or amount of tax, together with interest or penalty, required to be collected, noting that fact upon the determination. Upon giving notice and demand, the amount determined shall be immediately due and payable. In any proceeding in court brought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virture [virtue] of the provisions of this section, the finding of the state tax commission, made as herein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes prima facie evidence of the taxpayers [taxpayer’s] design.

      Collection procedures may be instituted immediately. Any taxpayer deeming himself aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice, petition to the state tax commission for a redetermination upon payment of the tax together with interest and penalty demanded by the assessment to the state tax commission.

The record was clear that taxpayer opted to file an appeal with the board within the time permitted, rather than filing a complaint with the district court. In granting taxpayer’s motion for reconsideration, the district court attempted to treat taxpayer’s appeal to the board as the filing of a complaint with the district court. In effect, the district court extended the time within which taxpayer might file a complaint with the district court for a review of the commission’s redetermination; the district court did not have jurisdiction to do so.

For this reason, the Legislature herewith submits an advisory ballot to the electors of the state of Idaho, and the results will guide the Legislature as to whether the three-tenths of one percent property tax previously contained in Section 33-802, Idaho Code, and levied against the market value of taxable property in the school districts for maintenance and operation purposes of school districts should continue to be removed and the funds be replaced by a sufficient increase in the state sales tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The Secretary of State shall have the question below placed on the 2006 general election ballot and shall take necessary steps to have the results on the question tabulated. The question shall be as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Should the State of Idaho keep the property tax relief adopted in August 2006, reducing property taxes by approximately $260 million and protecting funding for public schools by keeping the sales tax at 6%?.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “The advisory question provided for in this act is hereby declared to be a ‘measure’ for purposes of Chapter 66, Title 67, Idaho Code, and the provisions of Chapter 66, Title 67, Idaho Code, shall apply thereto.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The advisory question was answered in the affirmative by the voters in the 2006 general election.
       </p>

        H.B. No. 243, ch. 116, 1967 Session Laws, as amended by H.B. No. 387, ch. 377, 1967 Session Laws, is not destructive of the system of county government envisioned by the Idaho Constitution, and more particularly, does not violate Idaho Const., Art. III, § 19, Idaho Const., Art. XII, § 2, or Idaho Const., Art. XVIII, §§ 1 and 5. Leonardson v. Moon, 92 Idaho 796, 451 P.2d 542 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriation to local governmental units of a percentage of “sales tax fund” was an “appropriation” within the meaning of Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 13, despite fact it was not for a specified sum, and no more, since this element of specificness is necessary only when the appropriation is made payable from the general fund; not when it is made payable from a special fund. Leonardson v. Moon, 92 Idaho 796, 451 P.2d 542 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since appropriation to local governmental units of percentage of sales tax fund was to be “applied by such taxing districts in the same manner and in the same proportions as revenues from ad valorem taxation” and was to be considered and budgeted against at the same time and in the same manner “as revenues from taxation on all classes of personal property which these moneys replace,” the legislature knew, or should have known, exactly for what purposes the sales tax grants were to be used; thus the requirements of the judicial interpretation of Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 13, were met. Leonardson v. Moon, 92 Idaho 796, 451 P.2d 542 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is not invalidated by Idaho Const., Art. IV, § 11, since interpretation that Idaho Const., Art. IV, § 11 requires every appropriation to be broken down into several items is not warranted. Leonardson v. Moon, 92 Idaho 796, 451 P.2d 542 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriation by legislature to local governmental units, of taxes derived from the “sales tax fund” was not repugnant to Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 6, since such taxes are obviously excise taxes, and by long history of judicial interpretation, prohibition in Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 6 against legislature imposing taxes for local purposes has been limited to ad valorem or property taxes and has not been applied to excise taxes. Leonardson v. Moon, 92 Idaho 796, 451 P.2d 542 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the 1998 constitutional amendments to amend Idaho Const., Art. IX, §§ 3 and 11 were related as part of a common scheme for funding education, the joint submission of the amendments to the electorate on a single ballot was constitutional, and the subsequently enacted Idaho School Bond Guaranty Act and related statutory enactments or amendments by S.L. 1999, ch. 328 were upheld.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The formula for distribution on a graduated basis of a portion of the sales tax fund to the counties and other taxing units therein is merely an attempt to reimburse those taxing units for the loss of revenue resulting from the exemption in the process of business inventory ad valorem taxation phaseout; the formula is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable in view of the purposes of the formula.

        Section 146 of S.L. 2009, ch. 341 purported to amend this section, effective January 1, 2011, but the amendment could not be given effect because of the repeal and enactment of the section by S.L. 2009, ch. 62, §§ 2 and 3. As amended by S.L. 2009, ch. 341, § 146, this section would have read: “Tangible personal property sold by certain retailers. (1) A developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services and collected sales or use tax from customers at the location of the developer’s retail commercial complex may qualify for a rebate of taxes paid on such purchases, but only if the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services has built a complex in Idaho that is of a minimum cost as provided in subsection (2) of this section and has incurred costs in excess of eight million dollars ($8,000,000) for the installation of an interchange from an interstate highway or a highway enumerated in section 40-201, Idaho Code, by the Idaho transportation department or a political subdivision or a contractor of the transportation department or political subdivision and/or freeway interchange improvements on land owned by the state of Idaho or a political subdivision and/or auxiliary lanes necessitated by the design and construction of interchanges.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) To qualify for the rebate, the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services shall have those stores collect sales and use taxes on sales of tangible personal property or taxable services from the retail commercial complex. Any improvement or alteration to a public highway must be bonded in accordance with the public contracts bond act in chapter 19, title 54, Idaho Code. Once the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services certifies that the retail commercial complex has cost a minimum of four million dollars ($4,000,000) and the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services has expended in excess of eight million dollars ($8,000,000) for the installation of an interchange and/or related interchange improvements from an interstate highway by the Idaho transportation department or a political subdivision or a contractor of the transportation department or political subdivision and/or freeway interchange improvements, the developer may file with the state tax commission a refund request of sixty percent (60%) of the sales and use taxes collected for the sale of tangible personal property or taxable services from stores in the retail commercial complex. The refund request shall state that the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services has constructed a retail facility that meets the minimum expenditure requirements and also meets the minimum expenditure requirements for an interchange and/or related freeway interchange improvements and/or highway improvements to be eligible for the rebate, and that the developer is entitled to receive a rebate of sixty percent (60%) of all sales and use taxes collected by the stores in the retail commercial complex that qualifies for the rebate created by this section. The state tax commission may require that sufficient documentation be provided by the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services regarding expenditures and shall require an attestation from the Idaho transportation department or a political subdivision that the minimum requirements of this section have been met. The transportation department or the political subdivision shall verify to the state tax commission the amount of expenditures the developer has expended on the interchange and/or related freeway interchange improvements and/or highway improvements.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) Upon filing of a written refund claim by the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services entitled to the rebate, and subject to such reasonable documentation and verification as the state tax commission may require, the rebate shall be paid by the state tax commission from the demonstration pilot project fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury, in a timely manner not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days after receipt as funds are available. To qualify for the rebate, stores in an eligible complex shall report their sales to the state tax commission separately from other stores they own in the state. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to hold the state of Idaho or any political subdivision liable for any and all liens filed on a project subject to rebate pursuant to this section. All sales and use tax information remitted by retailers shall be deemed a trade secret, shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed by the state tax commission. A developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services must submit a claim for refund pursuant to this section within two (2) years of the developer’s last expenditure on the interchange and/or related freeway interchange improvements and/or highway improvements. No interest shall be paid by the state on moneys refunded and all moneys refunded shall be paid from the sales tax account pursuant to subsection (12) of section 63-3638, Idaho Code, and shall be limited to a total aggregate of thirty-five million dollars ($35,000,000) or lesser amount if that is what was expended.
    “(4) Once the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services has recouped its costs of funding the interchange and/or related freeway interchange improvements and/or highway improvements and/or related transportation infrastructure, the developer shall be ineligible to receive the rebate pursuant to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) As used in this section:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) ‘Development of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services’ includes all buildings, the parking lot, sidewalks and all accessory equipment including, but not limited to, lighting and traffic signs. Retail stores in the retail commercial complex shall sell tangible personal property or taxable services that are subject to the sales and use tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) ‘Freeway interchange improvements’ includes on and off ramps, overpass and underpass improvements and signalization to facilitate the effective access from the interstate highway system.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) ‘Highway improvements’ shall be improvements or upgrades to highways enumerated in section 40-201, Idaho Code.”

If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this Article do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in this State, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) separate accounting;
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

In responding to the request, the Commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise. The Commission may enter into agreements with party States or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit.

If the party or subject matter on account of which the Commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the State or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the State in which the object of the order being sought is situated.

If the Commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party States or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the Commission.
    6. Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this Article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party States, their subdivisions or the United States.

Each party State and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.

The two persons selected for the Board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the Board. If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the Arbitration Panel. No member of a Board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if he is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding.

Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the Board. In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the Board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the State in which the Board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt.

       8. Unless the parties otherwise agree the expenses and other costs of the arbitration shall be assessed and allocated among the parties by the Board in such manner as it may determine.

No officer or employee of a State or local government who serves as a member of a Board shall be entitled to compensation therefor unless he is required on account of his service to forego [forgo] the regular compensation attaching to his public employment, but any such Board member shall be entitled to expenses.

        The 1944 amendment to Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 12, creating the state tax commission, merely directed it to continue to perform the statutory duties imposed upon its predecessor and, in addition, gave it the constitutional duty of supervision and coordination of the work of the several county boards of equalization. Consequently, the tax commission’s duty to conduct statewide assessments of the railroads’ operating properties is statutory in nature and not constitutional. Since the legislature has plenary power in all matters of legislation except as prohibited or limited by the Constitution, it is free to amend or repeal its enactments and there are no provisions in the Constitution prohibiting it from creating a board of tax appeals empowered to review the tax commission’s assessments of railroads’ operating property; accordingly, the legislative authorization that the board of tax appeals has the power to review the tax commission’s assessments of railroads’ operating properties is not prohibited by the Constitution.

Therefore, it is apparent that the legislature did not contemplate that the action of the state tax commission in equalizing assessments would be subject to review by either the district courts or by the board of tax appeals.

        This section expressly authorizes county assessors to appeal to the board of tax appeals from determinations of the state tax commission as to valuations of property made on a statewide basis; it would be incongruous for the legislature to have intended that one party to a valuation controversy (an assessor) should be allowed an appeal to the board of tax appeals, but the other party to the controversy (the railroads) could not appeal to the board of tax appeals. The legislature intended this section to be the remedy whereby taxpayers such as the railroads may obtain a review of the commission determination of the valuation of operating property. Union Pac.

        Administrative Remedy Process.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where taxpayer alleged excessive assessments on his personal property arising from the assessor’s application of rates different from rates at which other property in the county was assessed, taxpayer’s claim had to be pursued through the statutory administrative process provided for in this title prior to his seeking relief in the district court by way of a declaratory judgment or refund. V-1 Oil Co. v. County of Bannock, 97 Idaho 807, 554 P.2d 1304 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In routine tax assessment complaints, the pursuit of statutory administrative remedies is a condition precedent to judicial review; however, the rule that administrative remedies must be exhausted before the district court will hear a case is a general rule and has been deviated from in some cases. Fairway Dev. Co. v. Bannock County, 119 Idaho 121, 804 P.2d 294 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exceptions to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine did not apply where the issue was the correctness of tax assessments. In such a case the district court does not acquire subject matter jurisdiction until all the administrative remedies have been exhausted. Fairway Dev. Co. v. Bannock County, 119 Idaho 121, 804 P.2d 294 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxpayer who appealed a county tax assessment ruling to the board of tax appeals but was not present at the board’s hearing failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and, thus, was not entitled to judicial review, because a board rule required him to actually appear and participate in the hearing. Blanton v. Canyon County, 144 Idaho 718, 170 P.3d 383 (2007).

        Burden of Proof.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Taxpayer, who was also a member of the Idaho state legislature, was just a taxpayer, with no greater privilege than his constituents. Idaho Const., Art. III, § 7 speaks of privilege from liability to civil process, not privilege from conformance with the rules governing permissive actions. Accordingly, because the taxpayer failed to timely file his board of tax appeals (BTA) appeal, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; consequently, neither the BTA nor the district court had jurisdiction to consider any of the taxpayer’s arguments about the legality or appropriateness of Idaho’s tax system. Hart v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 154 Idaho 621, 301 P.3d 627 (2012). Burden of Proof.
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxpayer had the burden, by only a preponderance of the evidence, to show that real property valuations were erroneous, both before the board of tax appeals and in the district court. There was no reversible error, however, in also citing the clear and convincing standard, as the district court’s order showed that the evidence failed to even meet the lower burden of proof. Wurzburg v. Kootenai County, 155 Idaho 236, 308 P.3d 936 (Ct. App. 2013).

        Jury Trial.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The district court did not err in denying a jury trial in action by taxpayers challenging contract between county and appraiser and seeking a county wide tax rollback and refund, since there was no constitutional or statutory basis for right to jury trial in such an action. Coeur d’Alene Lakeshore Owners & Taxpayers, Inc. v. Kootenai County, 104 Idaho 590, 661 P.2d 756 (1983).

       <p>
        This section specifically provides for appeals from decisions by the board to the district court “in the case of a taxpayer whose taxes are assessed on a statewide basis.” That language clearly indicates a legislative contemplation that such a taxpayer “assessed on a statewide basis” should be first able to appeal to the board of tax appeals from a statewide evaluation by the tax commission; otherwise the statutory language is totally superfluous.

       <p>
        District court properly modified a board of tax appeals’ property valuation because: (1) the county showed that the original valuation erred; (2) the court applied proper law, as the court did not have to analyze each appraisal method; and (3) the court explained the methodology it found more applicable, the valuation it found more accurate, and the expert it found more reliable.

P. 84, and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t63c38s63-3812" target="_self">§ 63-3812</a></cite>(c), this standard of review is improper where the district court conducts a trial de novo on the appeal from the agency’s decision.

        In a challenge to the assessor’s valuation of property, the value of property for purposes of taxation as determined by the assessor is presumed to be correct; and the burden of proof is upon the taxpayer to show by clear and convincing evidence that he is entitled to the relief claimed.
