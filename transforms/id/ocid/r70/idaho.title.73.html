        The first section of this title in Compiled Laws declared an emergency in the enactment of that code. The enactment of Compiled Laws was approved January 25, 1919.
       </p>
       <p>
        The following note is taken from Compiled Statutes of Idaho: “Part V of Compiled Laws, entitled as above, ‘General Code Provisions,’ is not applicable to Compiled Statutes as a code, since no formal enactment of Compiled Statutes as such has been made. It is inserted in this compilation as referring only to Compiled Laws but an additional section (§ 73-120) has been added to embrace the local and special laws enacted at the 1919 session.”

        When a statutory period of limitation is amended to reduce the limitation period, a party whose right accrues before the effective date of the amendment cannot be heard to complain if he is given the full time for action according to the terms of the amended statute from and after the effective date of the amended statute; thus, where the 1976 amendment to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.31.html#t31c35s31-3504" target="_blank">§ 31-3504 </a></cite>reduced the time period for applying for medically indigent benefits from within one year of discharge from the hospital to within 45 days following admission to the hospital, and the indigent applicant who had received medical treatment through February, 1976, was given 45 days from the effective date of the 1976 amendment, July 1, 1976, in which to file an application, the trial court did not err in holding that the plaintiff’s application filed in November of 1976 was untimely.

        A city’s exercise of the right of eminent domain to condemn the property of an electrical power co-operative within newly annexed territory was governed by the statute in force at the time it filed its answer and counterclaim and not one which became effective subsequently to such filing, but prior to trial of the cause. Unity Light & Power Co. v. City of Burley, 92 Idaho 499, 445 P.2d 720 (1968).

        Where subsequent to district court’s decision in child custody case, the legislature recodified and substantially modified the applicable statute, the former version of the statute controls the disposition of the case under this section.

        Statutes authorizing discretionary awards of attorney fees generally are held to be remedial or procedural; consequently, they are given retroactive effect. Myers v. Vermaas, 114 Idaho 85, 753 P.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suit by architects against state building authority for breach of contract that provided for architectural and certain other services,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120</a></cite>(3) clearly could be applied to award attorney fees against the authority because such action involved a contract for services as well as a commercial transaction; further, the fact that the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120</a></cite>(3) regarding contracts relating to services were not added to the section until its 1986 amendment and the definition of party did not include the state of political subdivisions thereof until the 1987 amendment of the section, did not prohibit application of such section, since the suit was filed after the passage of either of these amendments, as the proper function is upon the time of the filing, not the time the cause of action arose. Bott v. Idaho State Bldg. Auth., 122 Idaho 471, 835 P.2d 1282 (1992).

        Construction of Statutes.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The construction given a statute by the executive and administrative officers of the state is entitled to great weight and will be followed unless there are cogent reasons for a change. Breckenridge v. Johnston, 62 Idaho 121, 108 P.2d 833 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of an express declaration of legislative intent that a statute apply retroactively, it will not be so applied; however, a statute, which is remedial or procedural in nature, and which does not create, enlarge, diminish, or destroy contractual or vested rights, is generally held not to be a retroactive statute, even though it was enacted subsequent to the events to which it applies. Gailey v. Jerome County, 113 Idaho 430, 745 P.2d 1051 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes which do not create, enlarge, diminish or destroy contractual or vested rights are deemed to be remedial or procedural, as opposed to substantive, and they may be applied retrospectively. Myers v. Vermaas, 114 Idaho 85, 753 P.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        An application of law is deemed retrospective if it affects substantive rights. Myers v. Vermaas, 114 Idaho 85, 753 P.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding that direct appeal was fully conducted and final in 1985, the district court relied upon the 1986 amendment to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c49s19-4901" target="_blank">§ 19-4901 </a></cite>in ruling that defendant had waived most of the issues raised in his petition. This was error. This section clearly prohibits the retroactive application of newly passed legislation. As is readily apparent from the text of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c49s19-4901" target="_blank">§ 19-4901</a></cite>, there is not even a hint of legislative intent that<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c49s19-4901" target="_blank">§ 19-4901 </a></cite>could be retroactively applied.

    Paternity action against defendant determined to be father of child was not barred by the statute of limitations as the 1986 amendments to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.07.html#t07c11s7-1107" target="_blank">§ 7-1107 </a></cite>clearly expressed the legislature’s intention that the statute of limitations not run on a cause of action for any child born before or after the effective dates of the amendment. Henderson v. Smith, 128 Idaho 444, 915 P.2d 6 (1996). Express Declaration of Retroactivity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1974 legislative amendment to subsection 1. of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-218" target="_blank">§ 5-218 </a></cite>is not retroactive in its application to January 1974, since a statute is not retroactive under this section unless expressly so declared, and the only express declaration of retroactivity in this amendment is to causes of action discovered within three years prior to its passage, on April 3, 1974. Lincoln County v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 102 Idaho 489, 632 P.2d 678 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is general agreement in the case law of this jurisdiction that there must be a clear expression of legislative intent of retroactivity before a statute will be given such effect. University of Utah Hosp. ex rel. Harris v. Pence, 104 Idaho 172, 657 P.2d 469 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally a statute will not be applied retroactively in the absence of clear legislative intent to that effect. However, retroactive legislation is only that which affects vested or already existing rights. City of Garden City v. City of Boise, 104 Idaho 512, 660 P.2d 1355 (1983).

       <p>
        If the language clearly refers to the past as well as to the future, then the intent to make law retroactive is expressly declared within the meaning of this section. Express words “this statute is to be deemed retroactive” are not necessary. Peavy v. McCombs, 26 Idaho 143, 140 P. 965 (1914). See also Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho 264, 220 P. 1088 (1923); Nampa & Meridian Irrigation Dist. v. Barker, 38 Idaho 529, 223 P. 529 (1924); State v. Cleland, 42 Idaho 803, 248 P. 831 (1926).

        Unless the legislature in its enactments uses expressions clearly indicative of the intent that the statute be given retrospective effect, it will not be so construed. In re Pahlke, 56 Idaho 338, 53 P.2d 1177 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Retroactive application of a statute is not allowed unless there is clear legislative intent to that effect; the language of the Idaho competition act indicates that it does not apply retroactively to permit the recovery of damages based upon conduct that occurred before its effective date. State v. Daicel Chem. Indus., Ltd., 141 Idaho 102, 106 P.3d 428 (2005).

        Although convicted sex offender contended that applying a 2009 amendment to the sex offender registration law to him violated this section, the offender did not contend that applying the amendment to him would violate any constitutional provision. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing his petition to be exempted from the duty to register as a sex offender Bottum v. Idaho State Police, 154 Idaho 182, 296 P.3d 388 (2013).

        This section does not preclude the legislature from amending the statute of limitations applicable to a given individual after the individual has committed a crime, but prior to the running of the statute of limitations in existence at the time of the commission of the crime.

        General rule that all statutes are to be so construed, if possible, as to be valid, requires that the statute shall never be given a retrospective operation, when to do so would render it unconstitutional, and words of statute admit of any other construction. Lawrence v. Defenbach, 23 Idaho 78, 128 P. 81 (1912).

        In enacting the workmen’s compensation law abolishing every remedy for all injuries received by a workman in the course of his employment, the legislature did not intend to take from the workman his common-law remedy for the negligent act of his employer, resulting in serious injury and damage to the workman, and give the workman no other remedy in lieu thereof, and the legislature would be deemed to have assumed that every injury would impair the workman’s usefulness in some degree, and that a workman should, in some measure, be compensated under the new remedy set up by the compensation law.

       <p>
        Where two conflicting acts upon the same subject-matter are passed at the same session of the legislature, and their conflict is such that they cannot be harmonized and stand together, and where one of them contains an emergency clause and the other does not, and the one containing the emergency clause was passed by both houses of the legislature after the other, under such circumstances, the act containing the emergency clause should prevail over the other.

        While it was not necessary for the purposes of this case to lay down a general rule for all cases, the court said that it was inclined to the opinion that, in case of an irreconcilable conflict between two acts passed at the same session of the legislature, the one should prevail which was last approved by the governor.

        When a statutory or constitutional provision is adopted from another state, where the courts of the state have placed a construction upon the language of such statute or constitution, it is to be presumed that it was enacted in view of such judicial interpretation and that the purpose was to adopt the language as the same had been interpreted and construed by the courts of the state from which it was taken. Stein v. Morrison, 9 Idaho 426, 75 P. 246 (1904).
    Intent must be expressed by words used, and legislative intention not expressed in some appropriate manner has no legal existence. State ex rel. Mitchell v. Dunbar, 39 Idaho 691, 230 P. 33 (1924).

       <p>
        Where word, clause or sentence appears in statute which clearly defeats intention of legislature and which may be omitted without defeating object or purpose of statute, and where intention can be definitely determined with word or clause stricken out, this may be done.

        Court is limited to declaration of intent of legislature and can neither legislate nor, by construction of statute, enlarge words to include other conduct of like, equal or greater atrocity, simply because it may be within the same mischief to be remedied, when it is not fairly included in language of act.

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2014, ch. 31 provided: “Legislative Intent. President Abraham Lincoln, having signed the congressional act creating the Idaho Territory on March 4, 1863, it is the intent of the Legislature to recognize March 4 as IDAHO DAY, through which the people of Idaho may yearly celebrate the rich history, cultural diversity, unique beauty and boundless resources of the State of Idaho and thereby gain a renewed sense of courage and confidence for the future. Throughout its one hundred fifty year history, Idaho has been the birthplace and home of remarkable men and women who have distinguished themselves nationally and internationally in the fields of law, literature, music, the arts, athletics, philanthropy, politics and even space exploration. The same combination of adventure, ambition, industry, innovation and enterprise that led to Idaho’s founding has created a cradle for entrepreneurs, innovators and visionaries. Their work has had a global reach and helped create the Panama Canal, Hoover Dam, the Chunnel, potato chips and computer memory chips, the supermarket, the engineering of wood products, farm machinery and locomotives, the laser printer and enough patents to rank Idaho among the nation’s most prominent intellectual incubators. It is the purpose of this act to provide the mechanism through which state and local agencies of government, historical societies, schools, colleges and universities, Indian tribes, service organizations, clubs, the media and Idaho citizens in general can educate others about Idaho, her culture, her resources, her history and her greatness.”

        A basic rule of statutory construction is that the application of a statute is an aid to construction, especially where the public relies on that application over a long period of time. State v. Hagerman Water Right Owners, Inc., 130 Idaho 727, 947 P.2d 400 (1997).
    Only when the language is ambiguous will a court look to rules of construction for guidance and consider the reasonableness of proposed interpretations. Statutory language is not ambiguous merely because the parties present differing interpretations to the court. City of Idaho Falls v. H-K Contrs., Inc., 163 Idaho 579, 416 P.3d 951 (2018).

    Because defendant doctor was one of only six cardiovascular surgeons in the state of Idaho and all six of these cardiovascular surgeons practiced together in Boise as a professional association, the standard of health care practice in the community ordinarily served by hospital was indeterminable and no “similar Idaho communities” existed about which plaintiff could have presented evidence of the standard of practice for a cardiovascular surgeon performing patent ductus arteriosus surgery; therefore,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1012" target="_blank">§§ 6-1012 </a></cite>and 6-1013 did not provide a means of establishing the applicable standard of practice in this case and in resolving whether out-of-state doctor qualified as an expert witness to testify on plaintiff’s behalf, the court turned to decisions predating the enactment of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1012" target="_blank">§§ 6-1012 </a></cite>and 6-1013.

       <p>
        Where a third party grabbed defendant’s gun during a kidnapping and shot the victim, the district court committed reversible error by relying on the proximate-cause theory — rather than the agency theory — when instructing the jury on felony murder under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c40s18-4001" target="_blank">§ 18-4001 </a></cite>and subsection (d) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c40s18-4003" target="_blank">§ 18-4003</a></cite>. The instruction allowed the jury to find defendant liable for any killing that occurred contemporaneously with the kidnapping, without regard to whether defendant and the shooter were engaged in a common scheme or plan to kidnap the victim. Idaho’s felony-murder statute must be viewed through the lens of the English common law under this section, which was that the felony-murder rule applied only to co-conspirators acting in concert in furtherance of the common plan or scheme to commit the underlying felony. State v. Pina, 149 Idaho 140, 233 P.3d 71 (2010), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

       </p>

        This section adopts only so much of the common law as is applicable to conditions in this state. English doctrine of riparian rights on navigable streams has been repeatedly held not applicable to this country. Northern Pac. R.R. v. Hirzel, 29 Idaho 438, 161 P. 854 (1916).

        Rule Against Perpetuities.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The common-law rule against perpetuities is generally stated to be that no interest in real estate is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest plus the period of gestation. Locklear v. Tucker, 69 Idaho 84, 203 P.2d 380 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho has adopted what is intended to be a complete system governing alienation of real property; and the common-law rule against perpetuities is not in force in this jurisdiction. Locklear v. Tucker, 69 Idaho 84, 203 P.2d 380 (1949).

        A school district is not entitled to a preference of its claim against a closed bank’s assets for the amount of an unpaid cashier’s check received for the school district’s check on its unsecured sinking fund deposit and sent to the state finance commissioner in payment of the district’s indebtedness to the state department of public investments, in the absence of a showing that the bank acted only as district’s agent in transmitting funds.

       <p>
        When statutory provision for compensation by the state to utilities ordered to relocate their facilities was declared unconstitutional, the common-law rule that a utility forced to move its facilities must do so at its own expense was applied.

        Succession of Property.

       <p>
        Under the code, a complete system for the succession to property of decedent is provided for; hence, court will not consider the common law. In re Reil’s Estate, 70 Idaho 64, 211 P.2d 407 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the state statutes purport to provide a complete system for the succession to property of decedents, the common-law restriction on succession of a killer to the estate of his victim would not apply to the claim of one convicted of the voluntary manslaughter of her husband as to a situation for which there is no statutory declaration or provision.

        Survival of Actions.

       <p>
        An action for the destruction of personal property caused by the negligence of a tort-feasor survives the tort-feasor, but consequential damages flowing from the injury to the person of the deceased in his lifetime does not survive. Moon v. Bullock, 65 Idaho 594, 151 P.2d 765 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims of medical expenses, lost income, lost earning capacity, emotional distress, anguish, and pain and suffering were personal to decedent and did not fall under any statutory exceptions; thus, applying the common law, all claims abated upon the decedent’s death. Estate of Shaw v. Dauphin Graphic Machs., Inc., 392 F. Supp. 2d 1230 (D. Idaho 2005), rev’d in part, 240 Fed. Appx. 177 (9th Cir. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The abatement rule holds that in the absence of a legislative enactment addressing the survivability of a claim, the common law rules govern. Under the common law, claims arising out of contracts generally survive the death of the claimant, while those sounding in pure tort abate. Bishop v. Owens, 152 Idaho 617, 272 P.3d 1247 (2012).

        Because it was already beginning to be abrogated in England hundreds of years before Idaho was settled, the doctrine of treasure trove was not part of the common law adopted in Idaho upon enactment of the statute. Corliss v. Wenner, 136 Idaho 417, 34 P.3d 1100 (Ct. App. 2001).

      A continuing code commission is hereby created in the office of the secretary of state, to be known as the “Code Commission,” to consist of three (3) persons, members of the Idaho state bar, who are actively engaged in the practice of law, not holders of any other compensated state office or position, whose residences are such that they may readily and conveniently meet from time to time as such commission. The “1947 Idaho Code Commission,” created and appointed pursuant to chapter 224, of 1947 Session Laws of Idaho is hereby continued in office as the code commission created by this act; one (1) of such commissioners shall continue in office until the first day of December, 1950, one (1) until the first day of December, 1952, and one (1) until the first day of December, 1954; the term to be served by each present commissioner shall be determined by the members of the commission; not later than twenty (20) days after the effective date of this act the commission shall certify to the governor and to the secretary of state the name of each present commissioner and the term determined to be served by him. At the expiration of each of said terms and of the terms hereinafter provided, a member of the commission shall be appointed by the governor to serve for a term of six (6) years. The appointee shall be selected from a list of not more than three (3) qualified persons whose names shall be submitted to the governor by the board of commissioners of the Idaho state bar not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of a term of a commissioner. At its first meeting after the effective date of this act the commission shall organize by selecting one (1) of its members chairman, and shall thereafter reorganize in the same manner at its first meeting held after each appointment of a commissioner. The secretary of state shall serve as permanent secretary of the commission. Each commissioner shall serve until his successor has been appointed. In the event a vacancy occurs in the commission other than by expiration of a term the remaining members shall fill such vacancy by appointment of a qualified person.

     <p>
      The commission is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to enter into and execute contracts it may deem necessary and proper with any publishing company, with respect to general laws, repeals and amendments which may be enacted by each regular session of the legislature hereafter, and beginning with the thirtieth session, and with respect to bringing up to date annotations, notes and indexes of general law continuing in force, for the publication thereof, and publication of any other compilation within the purview of this act. The intent hereof is that as soon as practicable after each session of the legislature the Idaho Code be brought up to date. Similar contracts relating to and after one or more special sessions may be entered into and executed if the commission deems it necessary and desirable. Whenever one or more volumes of the Idaho Code becomes too bulky, or for other reason it appears to the commission to be necessary or desirable, the commission may contract for republication of such volume or volumes, or additional volumes. When the commission deems it necessary or advisable, it may, in its sole discretion, assist the Supreme Court of the state of Idaho in any preliminary work or studies necessary in the preparation of rules of said court and any proposed legislation which may from time to time be necessary to segregate substantive from procedural law, and may contract for the publication in replacement or additional volumes of such rules as may be made, prescribed and promulgated by said court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contracts shall appropriately describe specifications of the editing, content of compilation, printing, binding, size of type to be used in text and notes, grade and weight of paper to be used, style of page, provisions for insertion of new matters, with appropriate section numbers in existing or changed titles and chapters, and shall require in full new and amended laws, repeals of laws, or parts thereof, constitutional changes, new and additional annotations, notes and indexes, references and cross-references relating to the existing laws of this state and to decisions of the Supreme Court of the state of Idaho, Idaho Court of Appeals, Supreme Court of the United States and federal courts citing and construing the same, formal Idaho attorney general opinions since January 1, 1983, citing and construing the same, history of the law or section, and shall contain such other information and ancillaries as the commission may deem necessary and proper, or as the publishers may include with the consent of the commission.
