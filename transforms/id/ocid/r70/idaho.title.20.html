       Although in light of this section it would appear improper for the board of correction to obtain custody and hold any offender at one of its institutions where the offender has not been both convicted and sentenced in respect to some charge, alleged illegality of the petitioners’ incarceration on death row during the time period from March 18, 1983 to April 4, 1983, pending resentencing as ordered by the supreme court, was a moot issue after the death penalty was again imposed, and denial of petition for habeas corpus was proper.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Each person convicted of an offense against the state, which was committed prior to July 1, 1986, and confined in a penal or correctional institution for a definite term other than for life, whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all the rules and has not been subject to punishment, is entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence beginning with the day on which the sentence starts to run as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Aol11">
       Five (5) days for each month, if the sentence is not less than six (6) months and not more than one (1) year.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Aol12">
       Six (6) days for each month, if the sentence is more than one (1) year and less than three (3) years.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Aol13">
       Seven (7) days for each month, if the sentence is not less than three (3) years and less than five (5) years.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Aol14">
       Eight (8) days for each month if the sentence is not less than five (5) years and less than ten (10) years.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Aol15">
       Ten (10) days for each month, if the sentence is ten (10) years or more.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      When two (2) or more consecutive sentences are served, the basis upon which the deduction is computed is the aggregate of several sentences.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, those inmates doing an outstanding job, may be awarded industrial or meritorious goodtime under rules adopted by the state board of correction, not to exceed five (5) days per month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inmates performing exceptionally meritorious or outstanding services under rules adopted by the state board of correction may be awarded a lump sum of goodtime. The number of days awarded may not exceed the regulatory maximum.

       <p>
        Where a statute such as this section permits an inmate to earn goodtime credits, the inmate has a liberty interest in the credits granted, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, which prevents deprivation of the credits in absence of due process requirements. Dallas v. Arave, 129 Idaho 819, 933 P.2d 108 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where department provided defendant with notice and opportunity to be heard as required by the safeguards of procedural due process prior to forfeiting 365 days of his accumulated goodtime credits, but rather than taking advantage of the opportunity, defendant invoked his right against self-incrimination and remained silent, there was no violation of substantive due process and such action was not fundamentally unfair because the jury in prosecution for criminal offense of escape determined he absconded from prison out of necessity to protect himself from danger of serious bodily harm. Dallas v. Arave, 129 Idaho 819, 933 P.2d 108 (Ct. App. 1997).

        Duration of Fixed Sentence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        For purposes of appellate review, the duration of a fixed sentence is deemed to be the term of the sentence, less the formula reduction available for good conduct under this section. State v. Rutherford, 109 Idaho 1016, 712 P.2d 717 (Ct. App. 1985); State v. Bishop, 110 Idaho 689, 718 P.2d 602 (Ct. App. 1986); State v. Cootz, 110 Idaho 807, 718 P.2d 1245 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is inappropriate for a judge to determine the length of a fixed sentence upon the assumption that it will be reduced by the discretionary “good time” available under this section for “inmates doing an outstanding job.” State v. Rosencrantz, 110 Idaho 124, 714 P.2d 93 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        For the purpose of sentence review, the duration of confinement imposed by a fixed sentence is deemed to be its facial term, less the credit available for good conduct under this section. State v. Lee, 111 Idaho 489, 725 P.2d 194 (Ct. App. 1986); State v. Torres, 112 Idaho 801, 736 P.2d 853 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        When reviewing a fixed sentence, the Court of Appeals treats the measure of confinement as the term imposed less statutory credit for good conduct allowed by this section. State v. Santos, 112 Idaho 1130, 739 P.2d 429 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because, with respect to sentences for crimes committed on or after July 1, 1986, the legislature eliminated the formula reduction previously available as a matter of right under this section and in its place enacted a narrow system of “meritorious” sentence reduction, any postulated measure of confinement under a fixed sentence can no longer rest upon an assumption that the prisoner will receive a “good time” credit; rather, as to crimes committed on or after July 1, 1986, the entire facial length of a fixed sentence must be treated as the term of confinement for the purpose of appellate review. State v. Amerson, 113 Idaho 183, 742 P.2d 438 (Ct. App. 1987).

        Where the record did not show that the defendant could never be safely returned to society on parole, the fixed life sentence for convictions of first degree burglary and sexual abuse of a child was inappropriate. State v. Eubank, 114 Idaho 635, 759 P.2d 926 (Ct. App. 1988).

       <p>
        A maximum sentence of a fixed period of five years where the actual period of imprisonment would be approximately three and two-third years, imposed where, following plea negotiations, defendant who was initially charged with assault accompanied by intent to commit a serious felony and with attempted rape entered a plea of guilty of aggravated assault, was not an abuse of sentencing discretion where defendant entered residence with intent to commit burglary and upon confronting victim brandished a gun and threatened her with rape even though defendant had suffered a troubled childhood, the death of his mother, the contribution of alcohol to his behavior and had no prior felonies as an adult and did not physically harm the victim and had compassion when she became ill. State v. Torres, 112 Idaho 801, 736 P.2d 853 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        A fixed life sentence may be deemed reasonable if the offense is so egregious that it demands an exceptionally severe measure of retribution and deterrence, or if the offender so utterly lacks rehabilitative potential that imprisonment until death is the only feasible means of protecting society. State v. Eubank, 114 Idaho 635, 759 P.2d 926 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>

        Where habeas petitioner claimed that he was not being provided an appropriate calculation of his good time credits, petitioner’s argument that he was being given insufficient good time credit was based upon a false assumption that 10 days per month was equivalent to one-third of the sentence; because not every month had 30 days, 10 days per month did not equate to one-third of the sentence, the good time credit allowed was 120 days per year, not one-third of 365 or 366 days.

       Where department provided defendant with notice and opportunity to be heard as required by the safeguards of procedural due process prior to forfeiting 365 days of his accumulated goodtime credits, but rather than taking advantage of the opportunity defendant invoked his right against self-incrimination and remained silent, there was no violation of substantive due process and such action was not fundamentally unfair because the jury in prosecution for criminal offense of escape determined he absconded from prison out of necessity to protect himself from danger of serious bodily harm.

       Where the department properly informed defendant of the disciplinary offenses with which he was being changed and followed the proper procedures in proceeding against him and gave him an opportunity to be heard as required by this section, he could not claim that due process was not afforded to him, because he voluntarily chose to remain silent at the hearing; therefore, magistrate’s holding that department compiled with due process and properly forfeited 365 days of defendant’s accumulated goodtime credits for the disciplinary escape violation was proper.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state board of correction or its designee shall, in its discretion have the power to establish rules and regulations under which an inmate may be privileged to furlough but to remain while on such leave in the legal custody and under the control of the state board of correction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before authorizing the furlough of an eligible inmate, the board of correction or its designee shall have said inmate appear before such board or designee and shall interview said inmate. An inmate shall be placed on furlough only when there has been made:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Col11">
       an administrative verification of the reason for which the inmate requests furlough;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Col12">
       arrangements for supervision, maintenance and care while on furlough;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Col13">
       verification that travel arrangements directly to and from the place of destination, with all expenses paid by the inmate or his family; provided however, that in the case of an indigent inmate, said expenses may be satisfied from the inmate welfare fund;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Col14">
       a determination of the leave duration, provided, however, that such leave may not exceed seventy-two (72) hours except in the case of a medical furlough for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of a serious illness or injury;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Col15">
       provision for signing a waiver of extradition;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Col16">

       there are no detainers against said inmate; and
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-101Col18">
       said inmate has been classified to minimum custody for a minimum of six (6) months immediately prior to the granting of said furlough and has been recognized for meritorious performance by the board of correction or its delegated authority while so classified to minimum custody, except in the case of a medical furlough for diagnosis or treatment of a serious illness or injury. Medical furlough inmates may be classified to minimum custody for less than a six (6) month period and need not be recognized for meritorious performance.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Condition (8) need not be met when the inmate has been classified to minimum custody and has been released to one of the department of corrections’s [correction’s] community work centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The voluntary and wilful failure of any inmate to abide by the terms of said furlough or to return to the state penitentiary prior to or at the expiration of the time allowed for such furlough shall be considered an escape or attempt to escape, as the case may be, from the custody of the state board of correction and shall be punishable pursuant to section 18-2505, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Furlough is authorized for diagnosis or treatment of a serious illness or injury, funerals, serious illness or accidents of the immediate family of the inmate, family visitation, to seek employment, and such other purposes that contribute to and promote a transition from confinement to the free society.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immediate family is defined as a mother or father, brothers, or sisters, of the whole or halfblood, a wife or husband, or lawful issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of correction or its designee shall notify local law enforcement officials in the county where the inmate is to be furloughed a reasonable time prior to placing said inmate on furlough. Such notice shall be in writing, provided, however, that such notice may be oral if exigencies require it. Due consideration will be given to the law enforcement decision.

       Each person convicted of an offense against the state committed on or after July 1, 1986, sentenced and confined in a state correctional facility for any term other than life, may be awarded a meritorious conduct reduction of their sentence by the director of the department of correction.

The award of a meritorious conduct reduction may be given under rules adopted by the Idaho board of correction. The number of days awarded may not exceed fifteen (15) days for each month sentenced.

      If any prisoner threatens personal injury to any officer, keeper or guard of the state penitentiary or other place maintained by the state board of correction, or acts in such manner as may reasonably lead the officer, keeper or guard to believe his life or the life of any prisoner is in danger, or which leads the officer, keeper or guard, to believe the prisoner is attempting escape, then such officer, keeper or guard, may proceed forthwith to use any weapon he may have to enforce obedience, and if in so doing any prisoner shall be necessarily wounded or killed, the officer, keeper or guard is justified and shall be held guiltless. For purposes of this section, a facility operated by a private prison contractor and housing prisoners pursuant to a contract between the contractor and the state board of correction, as set forth in section 20-241A, Idaho Code, shall be deemed to be maintained by or under the control of the state board of correction.

       Powers of Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of pardons [now commission of pardons and paroles], created by the Constitution, has power to remit fines and forfeitures and to grant commutations and pardons after conviction and judgment, and the governor has the power to grant respites and reprieves. State v. Iverson, 79 Idaho 25, 310 P.2d 803 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission of pardons and paroles had authority to add the intensive supervision program conditions to the defendant’s parole without violating the separation of powers doctrine of Idaho Const., Art. II, § 1. Mellinger v. Idaho Dep’t of Cors., 114 Idaho 494, 757 P.2d 1213 (Ct. App. 1988).

       When the commission of pardons and parole is exercising the parole function, as distinguished from its commutation and pardoning powers, it is exercising powers “delegated to it by the board.” Carman v. State, Comm’n of Pardons & Parole, 119 Idaho 642, 809 P.2d 503 (1991).

        Board of pardons is a branch of the executive department of the state government, and its powers and prerogatives, as such, are those of granting clemency to convicted prisoners, and it has no power to increase or extend penalties or punishments, imposed by judgment of the courts.

        Board of pardons may attach such conditions as they see fit to a pardon, commutation, or parole, so long as they are not immoral, illegal, or impossible of performance, provided they are to be kept and performed or complied with during the term for which prisoner was sentenced; but they cannot require convict, who has broken his parole, to undergo imprisonment after the expiration of the time fixed by the judgment of conviction for the termination of such imprisonment, by requiring him to serve an additional time equal to that during which he was out on parole.

        Where a motorcyclist was injured in a collision with a drunk driver who was on probation for driving under the influence of alcohol, the motorcyclist had a cause of action against the driver’s probation officer, whose negligent supervision of the driver foreseeably created a potential for harm to those motorists whom the driver would encounter on the state’s highways.

        Although the state laboratory’s confirmation of the urine test may have been sufficient to satisfy a judge, probation authorities were not precluded from gathering additional evidence of use or possession of a controlled substance; therefore, the probation officer’s nonconsensual, warrantless search of the residence was reasonably related to confirming the suspected controlled substances violation, and the district court did not err by refusing to suppress the evidence seized during the search.

        This section when read in connection with<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c03s20-301" target="_self">§ 20-301</a></cite>(2), can only mean that the legislature intended that the board of corrections would supervise parolees from Idaho penitentiary who remain in Idaho.

        As long as defendant was released, the department of correction had the duty of supervising him, and the parole supervision agreement he signed upon transferring to Idaho from Oregon was still in effect; even though on February 22, 1999, the Oregon authorities suspended defendant’s parole, when defendant arrived at the probation and parole office on February 24, 1999, he was still under the department’s supervision, and, pursuant to the parole supervision agreement, the Idaho probation and parole officers had authority to demand that defendant produce a urine sample for analysis, and to search defendant’s vehicle.

        Where defendant had signed consent to search form as condition of probation, had probation revoked, and then reinstated without signing consent form, he was deemed not to have consented to warrantless search by probation officer. However, even without consent, the search was not in violation of defendant’s rights, as his expectation of privacy was reduced as a probationer, and, as long as there were reasonable grounds, probation officer was justified in conducting warrantless search.

      § 20-220. Investigation and examination to precede probation or suspension of sentence.
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a probation and parole officer is available to the court, no defendant shall be placed on probation until a written report of investigation by a parole and probation officer shall have been presented to and considered by the court, and no defendant charged with a felony or indictable offense shall be released under suspension of sentence without such investigation. The parole and probation officer shall inquire into the circumstances of the offense, criminal record, social history and present condition of the defendant. Whenever practicable, such investigation shall include a physical and mental examination of the defendant. If a defendant is committed to any institution, the probation officer shall send a report of such investigation to the institution at the time of commitment.

        Absence of Hearing Request.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In the absence of an explicit request for a formal hearing, the court may reach its sentencing decision by receiving the unsworn formal statements presented by both sides, together with the presentence report and arguments of the respective counsel. State v. Coutts, 101 Idaho 110, 609 P.2d 642 (1980).

        Consideration by Court.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a presentence report did not recommend probation for defendant who pleaded guilty to charges of possession and delivery of a controlled substance, the failure of the case record to reflect whether trial court considered the report before sentencing defendant was not prejudicial error. State v. Arambula, 97 Idaho 627, 550 P.2d 130 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is proper for the court to receive and consider a presentence report; the hearing presents an opportunity to challenge or to rebut the report. State v. Cootz, 110 Idaho 807, 718 P.2d 1245 (Ct. App. 1986).
    Only after the sentencing court has considered a pre-sentence report is the court positioned to make an informed decision regarding the viability of probation. State v. Romero, 116 Idaho 391, 775 P.2d 1233 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a defendant is convicted of first degree murder and subject to the death penalty, probation, in all probability, is not a viable alternative; however, the failure to consider a presentence report in such a circumstance would without question constitute reversible error. State v. Romero, 116 Idaho 391, 775 P.2d 1233 (1989).

        Disclosure to Defendant.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial judge has discretion as to whether the full contents of the presentence report be disclosed to the defendant at the hearing on his application for probation, but, where he chooses not to disclose the report, he is obligated to give the defendant sufficient information concerning adverse matters contained therein so that the defendant may be in a position to offer intelligent refutation. Moreover, where the presentence report is used by the trial judge as the basis for determining the sentence imposed, or where it might otherwise influence the court in arriving at a sentence, full disclosure of the contents of the report must be made prior to any hearing on the sentence, after an application for probation is denied, in aggravation or mitigation of punishment in order to comply with the requirements of the statutes. State v. Rolfe, 92 Idaho 467, 444 P.2d 428 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant is entitled to challenge the reliability of the hearsay information contained in a presentence report at his sentence hearing, and in order to exercise this right he is entitled to examine the report prior to the sentence hearing and to bring to the court’s attention at the hearing matters contained in the report which he believes to be inaccurate. State v. Johnson, 101 Idaho 581, 618 P.2d 759 (1980).

        Failure to Conduct.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the defendant who pled guilty to robbery admitted at his mitigation hearing that he had been out of prison only three and a half months before he had committed the robbery and had escaped twice from minimum security confinement, the trial court’s rejection of probation as an alternative to incarceration and its imposition of sentence without a presentence investigation was not an abuse of discretion. State v. Roderick, 97 Idaho 82, 540 P.2d 267 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure to order a presentence report (PSR) when the defendant is being considered for probation is per se error. However, the converse is not true, and simply because probation is not an option in a particular case does not mean a sentencing judge may dispense with the presentence investigation. A trial court may forgo a PSR only where (a) the record affirmatively establishes a valid reason therefor, and (b) there is sufficient information from independent sources to enable the sentencing court to fashion an appropriate sentence. State v. Romero, 116 Idaho 391, 775 P.2d 1233 (1989).

        Furtherance of Punishment Goals.
       </h5>
       <p>
        There are four goals of criminal punishment: (1) protection of society; (2) deterrence of the individual and the public generally; (3) possibility of rehabilitation; and (4) punishment or retribution for wrongdoing. Without the crucial information provided in such sources as a presentence report, it is impossible for a sentencing court to make an informed decision necessary to promote these four goals. State v. Romero, 116 Idaho 391, 775 P.2d 1233 (1989).

        Hearsay Evidence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature has specifically authorized admission of hearsay evidence for sentencing purposes in the form of a presentence investigation report, under this section; hearsay evidence in this form is admissible at a sentencing hearing so long as the defendant is afforded an opportunity to present favorable evidence and to explain or rebut adverse evidence. Thus, the trial court properly relied on hearsay evidence contained in the presentence investigation report, consisting of a letter written by the defendant outlining his involvement in criminal activities and containing on allegation by a neighbor that defendant had poured glue on their walks and rock salt on their lawn, since the defendant had an opportunity to respond to these allegations during the sentencing hearing. State v. Mason, 107 Idaho 706, 692 P.2d 350 (1984).

        When a trial court receives information from an investigation report, the accused must have a reasonable opportunity to examine such report so that, should he desire, he may explain and defend adverse matters therein. State v. Grady, 89 Idaho 204, 404 P.2d 347 (1965).

       <p>
        Refusal of trial court to conduct a presentence investigation of defendant convicted of obtaining money under false pretenses was not erroneous where the defendant made no request for withholding or suspension of the sentence. State v. McCallum, 77 Idaho 489, 295 P.2d 259 (1956).

       <p>
        Defendant’s admission of an alleged probation violation eliminated the issue of whether sufficient evidence had been presented to support a determination that the defendant was in fact in violation. State v. Peterson, 122 Idaho 178, 844 P.2d 31 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Where the conditions of probation were not presented to the defendant in writing and explained to him by the sentencing court or at an early conference with the probation officer, prior to the time the defendant was alleged to have violated the conditions of his probation, the alleged violation of probation could not be the basis of reinstating his sentence. State v. Hancock, 111 Idaho 835, 727 P.2d 1263 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant argued there was no affirmative indication that he knew of the probation condition that he not drive his car. However, a defendant’s signature on a probation order indicates that he accepted and certified that he fully understood the conditions of probation. State v. Reine, 122 Idaho 928, 841 P.2d 458 (Ct.

        Where defendant had signed consent to search form as condition of probation, had probation revoked, and then reinstated without signing consent form, he was deemed not to have consented to warrantless search by probation officer. However, even without consent, the search was not in violation of defendant’s rights, as his expectation of privacy was reduced as a probationer, and as long as there were reasonable grounds, probation officer was justified in conducting warrantless search.

        The portion of this statute which permits a court to “impose any sentence which originally might have been imposed at the time of conviction” refers only to a revocation of probation following a withheld judgment, while the portion which permits the original “sentence imposed to be executed” refers to a revocation of probation following a suspension of the execution of judgment and sentence.

        The applicable legal standard governing probation modification proceedings is this: If, in the regular course of his or her duties, a judge becomes aware of circumstances constituting good cause for modification of the conditions or duration of probation (whether that be adding or eliminating conditions of probation or extending, reducing or terminating the duration of probation), after notice to the parties and affording the parties an opportunity to be heard, the trial court may modify the terms or duration of probation pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c02s20-221" target="_self">§ 20-221</a></cite>(1) or subsection (2) of this section.

       <p>
        Where defendant pled guilty to two separate crimes, received two separate sentences, and was serving two separate terms of probation, the state filed a motion to revoke probation, without making any distinction between the two suspended sentences, and the defendant was served with a bench warrant for alleged probation violations associated with each of his sentences, under the plain language of this section, the district court had to grant credit for time served against each suspended sentence. State v. Osborn, — Idaho —, 449 P.3d 419 (2019).

        Discretion of Court.

       <p>
        The revocation of probation is discretionary with the court; after sound determination that a probationer could not possibly perform fundamental conditions of his probation, the judge has discretion to remove probation and pronounce sentence. State v. Bell, 103 Idaho 255, 646 P.2d 1026 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a willful violation has occurred, the court has discretionary authority to revoke probation under this section. State v. Fife, 114 Idaho 103, 753 P.2d 839 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court acted within its discretion when it decided that a defendant’s conduct warranted the revocation of his probation. State v. Drennen, 122 Idaho 1019, 842 P.2d 698 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Neither the hearing, where the district court considered the prosecuting attorney’s motion for a writ of mandate to the department of health and welfare, nor the hearing on where judge reconsidered defendant’s sentence, relinquished jurisdiction, and committed defendant to the board of corrections, satisfied the requirements of due process necessary for a probation violation hearing. State v. Kelsey, 115 Idaho 311, 766 P.2d 781 (1988).
    Throughout probation revocation proceedings, the probationer is entitled to due process; before probation can be revoked, the court must conduct a hearing. State v. Buzo, 121 Idaho 324, 824 P.2d 899 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A probationer must be given a due process hearing before probation can be revoked upon satisfactory proof of a violation of a probation condition or “any other cause satisfactory to the court.” State v. Greenawald, 127 Idaho 555, 903 P.2d 144 (Ct. App. 1995).

       <p>
        It was contemplated, at the time of the original probation order which included a requirement that defendant pay a certain amount in restitution, that a monthly payment schedule would be established thereafter and that the probation terms might be lengthened. The subsequent order specifying the minimum payment did not retract the requirement of full restitution but merely set out a minimum payment plan in accordance with the court’s intent at the time of the initial probation order. Hence, the defendant was incorrect in asserting that complete restitution was not required and that he had satisfied all the conditions of his probation when the court extended the probation term for another seven years. State v. Breeden, 129 Idaho 813, 932 P.2d 936 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in modifying defendant’s probation from a term of six years to a term of life, as trial court knew defendant was on probation for delivery of methamphetamine to a minor, defendant violated probation by having sexual contact with a minor, and defendant intended to plead guilty to federal charges of child pornography. State v. Gibbs, 162 Idaho 782, 405 P.3d 567 (2017).

        Where there are outstanding criminal charges against a probationer which are not formally alleged as violations of probation, it is not error for information concerning those charges to be brought to the court’s attention in probation violation proceedings, so long as the court does not rely upon the pending charges to find that a probation violation has occurred. Such information may be considered by the court as a factor in deciding whether to revoke or continue probation. State v. Bell, 103 Idaho 255, 646 P.2d 1026 (Ct. App. 1982).

        When a trial court has initially sentenced a criminal defendant to a definite term of imprisonment, but has suspended the sentence and granted probation, it may not later upon revocation of probation set aside that sentence and increase the term of imprisonment. State v. Pedraza, 101 Idaho 440, 614 P.2d 980 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant’s admitted commission of a felony-possession of a dangerous weapon by an inmate was a “cause satisfactory to the court” for revoking the suspended sentence and reinstating the sentence. State v. Hancock, 111 Idaho 835, 727 P.2d 1263 (Ct. App. 1986).
    Where no motion to reduce the sentence was made under Idaho R. Crim. P. 35, nor was any suggestion made to the judge that under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c26s19-2603" target="_blank">§ 19-2603 </a></cite>he could choose not to reinstate the full ten-year sentence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in reinstating the remainder of the defendant’s ten-year indeterminate sentence, where the defendant was found to be in possession of a dangerous weapon while in jail. State v. Hancock, 111 Idaho 835, 727 P.2d 1263 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a court has abused its discretion in revoking probation and imposing a previously suspended sentence, the inquiry is whether the court acted within the boundaries of such discretion, consistent with any legal standards applicable to its specific choices, and whether the court reached its decision by an exercise of reason. The court in making its decision examines whether the probation is achieving the goal of rehabilitation and is consistent with the protection of society. State v. Hass, 114 Idaho 554, 758 P.2d 713 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In revoking the probation of a defendant and imposing a previously suspended sentence, the court is only required to act within the bounds of its discretion under this section and to reach its decision by an exercise of reason; it is not required to make a specific finding that defendant could not possibly perform the fundamental conditions of his probation. State v. Hass, 114 Idaho 554, 758 P.2d 713 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court of appeals found that the district court had acted within its discretion in revoking defendant’s three-year probation and reinstating the previously suspended sentence of five years fixed; reinstating the full sentence, minus credit for time served, was not an abuse of the court’s sentencing discretion. State v. Martin, 122 Idaho 423, 835 P.2d 658 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement of defendant’s two-year sentence for grand theft was not unreasonable where defendant had a long prior record and had previously absconded from parole in Oregon. State v. New, 123 Idaho 168, 845 P.2d 586 (Ct. App. 1993).

       <p>
        The court of appeals has construed Idaho R. Crim. P. 35 to authorize district judges to reduce a sentence which is being reinstated when the reduction is made at the time probation is revoked; therefore, the district court had authority to reduce defendant’s sentence at the time it revoked his probation; because the district judge reduced defendant’s original sentence “upon” revoking his probation, the state’s argument that the court lacked jurisdiction was unfounded.

    Trial court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate alleged probation violations, even though a bench warrant was not issued on the probation violations before the probation period expired, because the proceedings commenced when a probation violation report alleging defendant’s possession of illegal drugs was filed in court within the probation period.

       <p>
        A probation revocation hearing must be based upon charges sufficiently specific that the probationer be informed of the alleged violated term or condition of the probation order and the manner and circumstances of his violation, so that he can intelligently prepare his defense; he must be allowed to call witnesses under oath, to testify himself and otherwise produce relevant evidence in his own behalf, and he must be given a reasonable opportunity to examine and rebut adverse evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. State v. Edelblute, 91 Idaho 469, 424 P.2d 739 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the defendant did not receive written notice of the alleged violation of probation or cause satisfactory to the court for revoking the suspended sentence before the hearing at which the violation was admitted, he waived his right to notice when he elected to proceed without an evidentiary hearing or a formal affidavit from the Department of Probation and Parole. State v. Hancock, 111 Idaho 835, 727 P.2d 1263 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a probation revocation proceeding two threshold questions are posed: (1) did the probationer violate the terms of probation; and, if so, (2) should probation be revoked? Then, if the court determines that probation should be revoked, a third question arises—what prison sentence should be ordered? State v. Corder, 115 Idaho 1137, 772 P.2d 1231 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court was within its authority to revoke defendant’s probation, even though revocation proceeding occurred outside of the 5 years probationary period imposed, because defendant’s probation was tolled for the two periods between the court’s issuance of warrants for probation violations and when those warrants were served, making the total time defendant spent under probationary supervision less than 5 years.

        Where probationer admitted his violations, eliminating the issue of whether sufficient evidence was presented to support a determination that he was in fact in violation, and had repeatedly demonstrated his unwillingness or inability to adhere to very fundamental conditions of probation, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking probation and ordering execution of the sentence. State v. Bell, 103 Idaho 255, 646 P.2d 1026 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court may, in its discretion, revoke probation at any time during the probationary period, if the defendant has violated any of the terms of the probation. State v. Case, 112 Idaho 1136, 739 P.2d 435 (Ct. App. 1987); State v. Hall, 114 Idaho 887, 761 P.2d 1239 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Possession of a firearm was sufficient, by itself, to prove a violation of probation, where the defendant’s Agreement of Supervision prohibited possession of any firearm or other weapon as set forth by the United States and state statutes, and the district court found that the defendant was informed he could not possess firearms and that he understood the condition. State v. Fife, 114 Idaho 103, 753 P.2d 839 (Ct. App. 1988).
    In a probation revocation proceeding, the court must decide whether the probationer violated the terms of probation and, if so, whether the probation should be revoked. State v. Marks, 116 Idaho 976, 783 P.2d 315 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had failed to make restitution as scheduled and had been charged, since being on probation, with petty theft and operating a motor vehicle without insurance, revocation of probation was not an abuse of discretion by the district court. State v. McDonough, 120 Idaho 650, 818 P.2d 354 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where prior reinstatements of probation did little to dissuade defendant from abusing alcohol which in turn led to new violations of the law, the revocation of probation by the district court was not an abuse of discretion. State v. Garcia, 124 Idaho 474, 860 P.2d 677 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>

        Until a probation was revoked and a sentence of incarceration was executed, the trial court never lost, and the Idaho department of correction never acquired, jurisdiction over a probationer; the trial court’s revisiting of the disposition order was permissible because the reconsideration occurred in what was, in substance, a continuation of the initial disposition hearing. State v. Done, 139 Idaho 635, 84 P.3d 571 (Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant admitted numerous probation violations, including failing to complete his first required treatment program, using medications contrary to the manner prescribed by a physician, failing to obtain a valid driver’s license, being terminated from a second required treatment program due to poor attendance and violations of his behavior contract, and having contact with another probationer, and defendant was given two opportunities to rehabilitate in the community, but continued to violate his probation, the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking defendant’s probation and ordering execution of his original sentence. State v. Morgan, 153 Idaho 618, 288 P.3d 835 (Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is within the trial court’s discretion to revoke probation if any term or condition of the probation has been violated, and the decision to revoke probation will be disturbed on appeal only upon a showing that the trial court abused its discretion. State v. Cornelison, 154 Idaho 793, 302 P.3d 1066 (Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a court reaches the factual predicate as to whether there was an actual probation violation, a determination must be made as to whether the term violated is valid. Then, it is within the trial court’s discretion to revoke probation, if any of the terms and conditions of the probation have been violated. Once a probation violation is established, the district court must then determine whether to revoke or continue probation. In determining whether to revoke probation, a court must examine whether the probation is achieving the goal of rehabilitation and is consistent with the protection of society. State v. Leveque, — Idaho —, — P.3d —, 2017 Ida. App. LEXIS 95 (Ct. App. Nov. 20, 2017).

        Where, in revoking defendant’s probation and imposing a previously suspended sentence, the court noted that this was the third violation of probation by defendant and that he had continued to engage in counter productive acts, including consorting with individuals who made adherence to his probation requirements difficult, there was no abuse of discretion. State v. Hass, 114 Idaho 554, 758 P.2d 713 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the conditions of probation included the requirements that the defendant pay restitution in the amount of $300 per month, that he actively seek out and retain the employment necessary to make his restitution payments, and that he maintain close contact with his probation officer, and the district court specifically found that the defendant had not actively sought or maintained employment and had not paid restitution, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking the defendant’s probation. State v. Hall, 114 Idaho 887, 761 P.2d 1239 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant’s probation and ordering execution of his sentence, where defendant violated the terms of his probation twice within a one-year period, where the district court noted that defendant had not responded to probation counseling and was not likely to do so in the future, and where the district court took into consideration defendant’s mental impairments in reaching its decision and retained jurisdiction over defendant for 120 days to further evaluate his mental condition. State v. Fife, 115 Idaho 879, 771 P.2d 543 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant demonstrated a reckless disdain for the authority of the court by repeatedly violating probation conditions, and where even after the trial court sternly warned her to refrain from any conduct not expressly permitted by her probation officer, defendant violated her curfew and engaged in conduct demonstrating a willingness to bring harm upon herself (taking a drug overdose) or upon others (driving under the influence), under the circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in holding that probation should be revoked. State v. Marks, 116 Idaho 976, 783 P.2d 315 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had a history of previous convictions for lewd conduct with minors and had violated probation on other occasions, although counseling would not be available in custody, the district judge’s ruling was consistent with the often cited primary sentencing goal of protection of society; the district judge had sufficient information to decide that probation was not working and that continued probationary status would endanger the public, particularly young boys. State v. Beckett, 122 Idaho 324, 834 P.2d 326 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court noted in its comments at the probation revocation hearing that defendant had been given a number of prior opportunities to rehabilitate and to overcome his substance abuse problem. The court concluded, however, that defendant’s lack of success with probation, coupled with his propensity for violence, evidenced by his conviction for aggravated assault and his prior conviction of misdemeanor battery, required the revocation of probation. State v. Boss, 122 Idaho 747, 838 P.2d 876 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court concluded that the positive things defendant had done during probation were outweighed by the negative. Defendant was very untruthful in his response to the alleged probation violations, and when defendant committed the burglary in Idaho he was on probation for attempted petit theft in California. State v. Reine, 122 Idaho 928, 841 P.2d 458 (Ct. App. 1992).
    Where defendant left the jurisdiction without any contact with probation officials and offered no plausible excuse for this conduct and where the district court implicitly determined that defendant’s disregard of the reporting obligation was willful, and considering that he was also wanted on outstanding warrants in other counties for failure to report, the district judge acted within his discretion in revoking defendant’s probation notwithstanding that, at the time of the acts charged as violations, he had successfully completed half of his required probationary period. State v. Peterson, 122 Idaho 178, 844 P.2d 31 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant’s probation where defendant had understood the conditions of his probation but chose to ignore them whenever compliance became inconvenient and repeatedly absconded from probation. State v. New, 123 Idaho 168, 845 P.2d 586 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court properly took into consideration that defendant had violated his probation twice before the instant violation, which on each occasion was on account of drinking and driving leading to driving under the influence charges; therefore, the order revoking probation and committing defendant to serve his sentence was affirmed. State v. Thomas, 123 Idaho 183, 845 P.2d 1216 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court did not abuse its discretion when it revoked defendant’s probation where defendant’s failure to report to his probation officer made it impossible for the officer to monitor defendant’s living and working circumstances, his conduct, or the type of people with whom he was associating, and without the ability to monitor a probationer’s activities, the state is unable to assure that probationary release is consistent with the protection of society. State v. Chavez, 134 Idaho 308, 1 P.3d 809 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s revocation of probation on driving under the influence charges was appropriate, where defendant continued to drink alcohol after he was placed on probation and failed to obtain a prescription to help with his substance abuse issues.

        When a court determines that probation should be revoked, if a prison sentence previously has been pronounced but suspended, that sentence may be ordered into execution, or, alternatively, the court is authorized under Idaho R. Crim. P. 35 to reduce the sentence upon revocation of the probation. State v. Corder, 115 Idaho 1137, 772 P.2d 1231 (Ct. App. 1989).

       <p>
        After a probation violation has been proven, the decision to revoke probation and to pronounce sentence lies with the sound discretion of the trial court. Upon revoking probation, the court may order the suspended sentence executed, or, in the alternative, the court is authorized under Idaho R. Crim. P. 35 to reduce the sentence. State v.

        The condition that a probationer file a truthful written report, which included a question as to whether the probationer had contact with law enforcement, was valid as being reasonably related to the rehabilitation; therefore, there was no abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to revoke defendant’s probation for his failure to provide a truthful report.

        Where defendant, while on probation, drove while intoxicated, drove without privileges, obstructed an officer, repeatedly violated her curfew requirement, left the county without permission, and entered into a prohibited financial agreement in violation of the terms of her intense supervision, the district court’s finding that defendant was in violation of the terms of her probation was fully supported by the record. State v. Marks, 116 Idaho 976, 783 P.2d 315 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation officer instructed defendant not to drive or let anyone else drive defendant’s car until defendant purchased insurance for it. The state proved that defendant let his girlfriend drive it. The court revoked probation and ordered defendant’s sentence be executed. State v. Reine, 122 Idaho 928, 841 P.2d 458 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation can only be revoked if a violation is willful. Where defendant did not challenge the state’s assertion that he violated the term forbidding him from leaving the Third Judicial District without the permission of his probation officer, an inference of willfulness could be made from defendant’s inconsistent explanations and the district court could reasonably infer that defendant willfully violated the terms of his probation that restricted his travel and his contact with the victim.

        Appellate Review.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In the absence of exceptional circumstances, an inmate serving a single, indeterminate sentence for a crime not enumerated in this section, will be considered for parole at some time within the first one-third of the sentence. Accordingly, for the purpose of appellate review of an indeterminate sentence, the court of appeals will deem one-third of the sentence to be appropriate measure of the term of confinement, unless the record indicates the contrary. State v. Toohill, 103 Idaho 565, 650 P.2d 707 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing the length of confinement under indeterminate sentences, the court of appeals will take account of parole eligibility and presume that the defendant’s actual term of confinement will be at least one-third of his sentence. State v. Spurgeon, 107 Idaho 173, 687 P.2d 17 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        For the purpose of appellate review, one-third of 25-year indeterminate sentences is treated as the measure of confinement. State v. Glandon, 109 Idaho 755, 710 P.2d 665 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in denying parole, the pardons and parole commission orally stated reasons to the defendant at the hearing based on his drug-related crimes and the commission’s desire to have him serve more time, this satisfied the rational basis requirement of appellate review. Vittone v. State, 114 Idaho 618, 759 P.2d 909 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate review is limited to whether there is a rational basis in the record for the pardons and parole commission’s decision. Vittone v. State, 114 Idaho 618, 759 P.2d 909 (Ct. App. 1988).
    Given the close alignment of the commission of pardons and paroles with the board of corrections, the fact that the commission is exercising the parole power delegated to it by the board, and the fact that the legislature found it necessary to specifically give authority to the commission to promulgate regulations pursuant to the administrative procedures act in subsection (a) [now (2)] of this section, the commission’s parole and probation functions are, as were those of the board of corrections before it, exempt from the appeal provision of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c52s67-5215" target="_blank">§ 67-5215</a></cite>(a) (now repealed). Carman v. State, Comm’n of Pardons &amp; Parole, 119 Idaho 642, 809 P.2d 503 (1991).

        As a matter of law, this section does not constitute a bill of attainder in respect to the legislature’s constitutional power to determine when, or under what circumstances, a prisoner may be eligible for parole consideration. Volker v. State, 107 Idaho 1059, 695 P.2d 809 (Ct. App. 1985).

        This section does not place any substantive limitations upon the pardons and parole commission’s discretion in the consideration of its decision. Vittone v. State, 114 Idaho 618, 759 P.2d 909 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inmate’s due process rights were not violated because the commission on pardons and paroles rejected a hearing officer’s recommendation that the inmate be reinstated to parole; the commission had the sole authority to decide whether to revoke the inmate’s parole. Mattoon v. Blades, 145 Idaho 634, 181 P.3d 1242 (2008), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

        Due Process.

       <p>
        Parole under this section is only a mere possibility, and the possibility of parole is not protected by due process; the constitutional protection afforded this limited expectation of parole is found in the procedures enacted to grant parole. Vittone v. State, 114 Idaho 618, 759 P.2d 909 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of the prison warden in the inmate’s habeas corpus petition where the inmate’s allegation that he was informed of the Idaho commission of pardons and paroles’ parole decision in a summary fashion while being ushered from the room after the conclusion of his Sentence 1 parole revocation hearing was sufficient to raise factual issues as to whether the commission deprived the inmate of the right to notice and an opportunity to participate in a parole hearing on Sentence 2; these factual issues precluded summary judgment on the inmate’s claim for relief with respect to his Sentence 2 parole proceeding. Acheson v. Klauser, 139 Idaho 156, 75 P.3d 210 (Ct. App. 2003).

        Enhancement Sentence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A defendant sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence plus an additional term for use of a firearm, said sentences to be served consecutively, must serve the indeterminate life sentence until paroled or pardoned, at which time he or she must immediately begin serving the firearm sentence until paroled, pardoned, or discharged. State v. Kaiser, 108 Idaho 17, 696 P.2d 868 (1985).
    The requirements of this section do not constitute an enhancement of sentence; moreover, this section applies to a defendant not because of his mental or physical status but because he committed one of the enumerated offenses. It, thus, does not inflict a cruel or unusual punishment. State v. Gee, 107 Idaho 991, 695 P.2d 376 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, as in effect at the time defendant committed his crimes, a ten-year indeterminate sentence for robbery would require defendant serve an additional forty months following the completion of two concurrent twenty-five year determinate sentences. State v. Amerson, 129 Idaho 395, 925 P.2d 399 (Ct. App. 1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1123, 117 S. Ct. 2519, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1020 (1997).

       </p>
       <p>
        The counsel’s alleged error in stating the potential effect of a ten-year sentence, particularly the minimum time provisions for parole eligibility under this section, did not affect the voluntariness of the defendant’s guilty plea. Hays v. State, 113 Idaho 736, 747 P.2d 758 (Ct. App. 1987), aff’d, 115 Idaho 315, 766 P.2d 785 (1988), overruled on other grounds, State v. Guzman, 122 Idaho 981, 842 P.2d 660 (1992).

       <p>
        The court of appeals correctly applied the precedent that the failure of counsel to inform an accused of the effect of this section on the minimum period of confinement before eligibility for parole did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel that would affect the voluntariness of the plea. Hays v. State, 113 Idaho 736, 747 P.2d 758 (Ct. App. 1987), aff’d, 115 Idaho 315, 766 P.2d 785 (1988), overruled on other grounds, State v. Guzman, 122 Idaho 981, 842 P.2d 660 (1992).

        Time served on parole is not the same as time served in a correctional institution. Parole is a gratuity which shall be ordered only for the best interests of society, not as a reward of clemency. Flores v. State, 109 Idaho 182, 706 P.2d 71 (Ct. App. 1985).

       </h5>
       <p>
        As punishment for first degree murder, the accused may be sentenced to death or to a life term in the custody of the board of correction. Where capital punishment was not pursued by the state, the decision by the sentencing court as to whether the life sentence could be indeterminate with the possibility of parole after ten years, or would be served entirely in confinement as a fixed or determinate sentence without the possibility of parole, was a matter within the court’s discretion. State v. Tribe, 126 Idaho 610, 888 P.2d 389 (Ct. App. 1994).

       <p>
        Other than where legislative restrictions as to parole or other release of a committed offender have been placed on the board or commission involving certain specified crimes, the sentencing judge, using an indeterminate sentence with its maximum to be set by the judge, is basically viewing such maximum as being the longest period reasonably expected to be required to accomplish rehabilitation. State v. Kingsley, 99 Idaho 868, 590 P.2d 1014 (1979).

        Measure of Confinement.
       </h5>
       <p>
        For the purpose of appellate review, the court will apply the one-third measure of confinement, rather than a lesser statutory minimum, to an indeterminate sentence in a case under this section. State v. Jenkins, 105 Idaho 166, 667 P.2d 269 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a contrary statute or other indication in the record, appellate court, in reviewing sentence, will treat one-third of an indeterminate sentence as the measure of confinement. State v. Adams, 106 Idaho 309, 678 P.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        For the purpose of appellate review of the excessiveness of a sentence, but not as a prediction of parole, the appellate court presumes, absent a contrary statute or indication in the record, that the actual duration of confinement under an indeterminate sentence will be one-third of the sentence length. This section, which governs parole consideration in serious cases, including rape, is not deemed to be a “contrary” statute for this purpose; the one-third measure will be applied even if a prisoner might be eligible for parole consideration earlier under the statute. State v. Mahoney, 107 Idaho 190, 687 P.2d 580 (Ct. App. 1984).

       <p>
        One convicted of first degree murder may be sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence and if the sentence is for indeterminate life, this section, setting forth powers of the state board of correction, prohibits release on parole until ten years have been served; nevertheless, a sentence for a fixed term of ten years is in no sense of the phrase a life sentence.

       <p>
        Although only the commission for pardons and parole may impose substantive, rehabilitative conditions of parole, the board of correction may recommend substantive conditions, and the commission may delegate to its executive director the authority to act in its behalf in approving the board’s recommended parole conditions. Mellinger v. Idaho Dep’t of Cors., 114 Idaho 494, 757 P.2d 1213 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parole conditions are not additional punishments or penalties to the crime for which a person was sentenced and incarcerated; their violation may simply result in the loss of parole, consequently, implementation of the Intensive Supervision Program did not violate the ex post facto prohibition. Mellinger v. Idaho Dep’t of Cors., 114 Idaho 494, 757 P.2d 1213 (Ct. App. 1988).
    The intensive supervision program conditions of parole authorizing warrantless searches, requiring the payment of fees to defray costs of supervision, restricting the use of alcohol, and establishing a curfew and geographic restrictions were reasonable, were possible to perform, and had an acceptable aim toward rehabilitation. Mellinger v. Idaho Dep’t of Cors., 114 Idaho 494, 757 P.2d 1213 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        No constitutional violation occurred when an inmate was denied parole on the basis of his refusal to participate in a therapeutic community program. A rational basis existed for imposing that condition because his lack of willingness to participate in rehabilitative programming was relevant to the inquiry into parole suitability, required by subsection (c) [now (4)].

        When the minimum period specified by the judge has been served, the individual becomes parole-eligible; he may be released on parole at any time thereafter during the indeterminate portion of the sentence. State v. Knight, 114 Idaho 923, 762 P.2d 836 (Ct. App. 1988).

        The determination of whether an inmate has served a commensurate amount of his sentence such that he is eligible for parole rests with the department of correction, not the sentencing judge. State v. Sherman, 120 Idaho 464, 816 P.2d 1021 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination of whether or not an inmate has served a commensurate amount of his sentence such that he is eligible for parole rests with the department of correction pursuant to this section, and not with the sentencing judge; district court below correctly decided that defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief in an effort to challenge the authority of the parole commission to decide that a prisoner should not be released on parole until a point in time after the expiration of the minimum period of confinement ordered by the sentencing judge and specified under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c25s19-2513" target="_blank">§ 19-2513</a></cite>.

        Change in parole reconsideration rules did not constitute an ex post facto violation because the eligibility standards for parole were the same for a prisoner as they were when he was originally incarcerated; all that had changed was the procedure by which the prisoner was reviewed for parole eligibility.

        The commission for pardons and parole’s act of revoking the defendant’s parole for violating conditions recommended by the board of correction and approved by the commission’s executive director could be inferred as a ratification of the director’s approval.

        This state’s parole scheme does not establish a protected interest or right to be released; the “shall” language used in this section does not set forth detailed conditions and qualifications which, once being met, entitle a prisoner to expect parole, but rather merely sets forth conditions which must be satisfied before an applicant becomes eligible for parole.

       <p>
        Although subsection (c) [now (5)] directs that parole be granted when it was in the best interests of society and the prisoner is willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen, that determination is a discretionary decision of the commission of pardons and parole that does not vest in the prisoner a legitimate expectation of parole, but rather a mere possibility of parole.

        A regulatory change by the parole commission in the timing for review of an inmate’s eligibility for parole does not give rise to a claim that the alteration violates the constitutional restriction against ex post facto laws.

        Magistrate erred in finding moot, a habeas petitioner’s claim that the commission of pardons and parole violated the law by failing to grant him a parole hearing to consider his eligibility for institutional parole at any time during the service of his first two sentences, and the denial of an opportunity for institutional parole on his first two sentences carried potential collateral consequences of substantial magnitude because the denial of the opportunity for institutional parole potentially added nearly seven years to petitioner’s overall period of incarceration.

       <p>
        As a matter of law, this section does not constitute a bill of attainder; since the “type and severity” of the burden of undergoing a psychiatric evaluation is nonpunitive and slight, it bears a reasonable relationship to the proper state purpose of ensuring that prisoners released on parole will be likely to successfully serve the remainder of their sentences out of the physical custody of the board of corrections. State v. Gee, 107 Idaho 991, 695 P.2d 376 (1985).

        Where in amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner questioned the sufficiency of the amount of time—90 minutes—for his answers to written questions and responses during an interview by a psychological evaluator prepared pursuant to this section, but where on appeal he presented no cogent argument or citation to any authority demonstrating that any error occurred with regard to the preparation or consideration of the report which would entitle him to habeas corpus relief such issue was unreviewable. Freeman v. State, Comm’n of Pardons & Paroles, 119 Idaho 692, 809 P.2d 1171 (Ct. App. 1991).
    Magistrate and district court erred in dismissing the inmate’s petition as it was unclear from the record as to whether the individual who performed the inmate’s psychological evaluation was a licensed professional.

       <p>
        This section is designed to protect the public from sex offenders whose character or high likelihood of reoffense, as revealed by a psychological evaluation, suggests that they are not appropriate candidates for parole. Therefore, a potential parolee is not a member of the class of persons that this section is designed to protect. Dopp v. Idaho Comm’n of Pardons & Parole, 144 Idaho 402, 162 P.3d 781 (Ct. App. 2007).

       <p>
        A failure by the board of correction to provide psychological treatment for convicted pedophiles or other sexual offenders would not render either the conviction or the sentence, as pronounced, unlawful. If treatment is legally required, as the United States district court for this state has held, and if the treatment is nonexistent or is inadequate, then the proper remedy is to mandate reasonably adequate treatment. Hays v. State, 113 Idaho 736, 747 P.2d 758 (Ct. App. 1987), aff’d, 115 Idaho 315, 766 P.2d 785 (1988), overruled on other grounds, State v. Guzman, 122 Idaho 981, 842 P.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of psychological treatment available to the individual convicted of lewd and lascivious conduct created an issue cognizable in post-conviction relief proceedings. Hays v.

        Indeterminate sentence of 20 years upon conviction of second-degree murder, based on defendant’s shooting of wife, was within statutory maximum and was not excessive where defendant would be eligible for parole within five years, where sentence indicated that trial judge took account of mitigating factors, where society had an interest in retribution for and deterrence of similar crimes, and where rehabilitative programs would be available to aid defendant with regard to alcohol abuse and alleged post-traumatic stress disorder.

        In prosecution for attempted rape of a child, where the investigation disclosed that defendant, who was 22 years old when sentenced, had prior convictions for a burglary and two petit larcenies and also had a history of unlawful use and distribution of drugs and alcohol, the imposition of a ten-year indeterminate sentence did not represent an abuse of discretion and the district judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to retain jurisdiction under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c26s19-2601" target="_blank">§ 19-2601 </a></cite>4.

       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of indeterminate period not exceeding 25 years, imposed after conviction of second-degree murder, was not excessive where the record disclosed a senseless killing by a defendant with a long history of alcohol and firearm-related offenses; defendant would face confinement for a period of at least eight years and four months, under this section, which was warranted in order to protect society from defendant and as retribution for the senseless taking of human life.

        Through this section, having chosen to incarcerate a class of inmates on the basis of being sex offenders, and other categories of mental illness, the state has thus determined that it no longer has an interest in punishing the inmate, but rather in attempting to rehabilitate him; this rehabilitative rationale is not only desirable, but it is constitutionally required. Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of Cors., 595 F. Supp. 1558 (D. Idaho 1984), rev’d on other grounds, 869 F.2d 461 (9th Cir. 1988).

       <p>
        Notwithstanding the dilemma posed where little rehabilitation allegedly is available in the penitentiary in which defendant is confined, and where this section places stringent requirements for defendant’s possible release on parole, two-year minimum periods of confinement with regard to convictions on two counts of lewd conduct with a minor were reasonable sanctions for the crimes committed, and the aggregate 15-year maximum terms were reasonable outside limits of custody where defendant fails to demonstrate that he can be returned safely to the community at an earlier time.

       <p>
        Parole is within the legislative scope of establishing suitable punishment for crimes inasmuch as parole differs from pardon and commutation in that the parole merely allows the convicted party to serve part of his sentence outside the penitentiary but does not pardon him of his guilt or commute any portion of his sentence. Standlee v. State, 96 Idaho 849, 538 P.2d 778 (1975).

        The parole board has broad discretion and in reviewing a parole board’s decision a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the board. Therefore, the scope of judicial review is limited to determining whether the information relied on by the parole board was sufficient to provide a factual basis for the reasons given. Ybarra v.

        Information that an inmate is a suspect in another, as yet uncharged, crime is relevant to parole decision and a rule that a denial of parole following the commission’s receipt of such information will constitute an “arrest” for the uncharged offense would hamper the functions of both the probation and parole commission and law enforcement authorities and the denial of parole to defendant was not the equivalent of an arrest for the sexual offense that remained under investigation, his continued incarceration was for the burglary conviction and was not pretrial detention for the uncharged sex offense, and defendant’s sixth amendment rights were not implicated until formal charges were filed.

     <p>
      Any person under state probation or parole supervision shall be required to contribute not more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per month as determined by the board of correction. Costs of supervision are the direct and indirect costs incurred by the department of correction to supervise probationers and parolees, including tests to determine drug and alcohol use, books and written materials to support rehabilitation efforts, and monitoring of physical location through the use of technology. Any failure to pay such contribution shall constitute grounds for the revocation of probation by the court or the revocation of parole by the commission for pardons and parole. The division of probation and parole in the department of correction may exempt a person from the payment of all or any part of the foregoing contribution if it finds any of the following factors to exist:

      Money collected as a fee for services will be placed in the probation and parole receipts revenue fund, which is hereby created in the dedicated fund in the state treasury, and utilized to provide supervision for clients. Moneys in the probation and parole receipts revenue fund may be expended only after appropriation by the legislature. This section shall not restrict the court from ordering the payment of other costs and fees that, by law, may be imposed on persons who have been found guilty of or have pled guilty to a criminal offense, including those who have been placed on probation or parole.

       Any parole or probation officer may arrest a parolee, probationer, or person under drug court or mental health court supervision without a warrant, or may deputize any other officer with power of arrest to do so, by giving such officer a written statement hereafter referred to as an agent’s warrant, setting forth that the parolee, probationer, or person under drug court or mental health court supervision has, in the judgment of said parole or probation officer, violated the conditions of drug court or mental health court or conditions of his parole or probation. The provisions of this section shall apply where the court has provided for the service of discretionary jail time.

       Such written statement or agent’s warrant, delivered with the parolee, probationer, or person under drug court or mental health court supervision by the arresting officer to the official in charge of the institution from which the parolee was released, the county jail or other place of detention, shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the probationer, parolee, or person under drug court or mental health court supervision.

       The agent’s warrant issued by the parole or probation officer shall be sufficient authorization for a local law enforcement officer to transport the probationer, parolee, or person under drug court or mental health court supervision to the appropriate jurisdiction to be housed pending appearance before the sentencing court or the commission.

       The parole and probation officer shall at once notify the commission, or the court, of the arrest and detention of the parolee, probationer, or person under drug court or mental health court supervision, and shall submit in writing a report showing in what manner the parolee, probationer, or person under drug court or mental health court supervision is alleged to have violated the condition of his or her parole, probation, or drug court or mental health court program.

The statement shall be attested to under oath or under penalty of perjury pursuant to section 9-1406, Idaho Code, and shall be submitted within twenty-four (24) hours of the arrest. If a judicial determination of probable cause is not made within forty-eight (48) hours of arrest, then the probationer shall be released.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission for pardons and parole, in releasing a person on parole, shall specify in writing the conditions of parole, and a copy of such conditions shall be given to the person paroled. The commission shall include in the conditions of parole a requirement that the defendant enter into and comply with an agreement of supervision with the board of correction. The agreement of supervision shall include provisions setting forth the potential sanctions for a violation of the conditions imposed and potential rewards for compliance with the conditions imposed, as such sanctions and rewards are set forth in rules of the board. Whenever the commission finds that a parolee may have violated the conditions of parole, the written order of the commission, signed by a member or members of the commission or the executive director, shall be sufficient warrant for any law enforcement officer to take into custody such person, and it is hereby made the duty of all sheriffs, police, constables, parole and probation officers, prison officials and other peace officers, to execute such order. Such warrant shall serve to suspend the person’s parole until a determination on the merits of the allegations of the violation has been made pursuant to a revocation hearing. From and after the issuance of the warrant and suspension of the parole of any convicted person and until arrest, the parolee shall be considered a fugitive from justice. Such person so recommitted, except as provided in section 20-229B, Idaho Code, must serve out the sentence, and the time during which such prisoner was out on parole shall not be deemed a part thereof, unless the commission, in its discretion, shall determine otherwise, but nothing herein contained shall prevent the commission from again paroling such prisoners at its discretion.

This section is the only section which speaks to this question, and its plain language need not be modified by judicial construction to accommodate the other statutes; accordingly a judicially created exception to the express language of this section was not proper where it permitted a defendant’s parole time to count together with his prison time in calculating the duration of his sentence.

        This section does not expressly provide for the parole agreement to be of no effect upon the issuance of a warrant or upon incarceration. The issuance of an arrest warrant suspends a parolee’s liberty and his physical freedom from incarceration; however, the applicable terms and conditions of his parole, such as a Fourth Amendment waiver, remain operative until revoked through a due process hearing.

        The intensive supervision program conditions of parole authorizing warrantless searches, requiring the payment of fees to defray costs of supervision, restricting the use of alcohol, and establishing a curfew and geographic restrictions, were reasonable, were possible to perform, and had an acceptable aim toward rehabilitation. Mellinger v. Idaho Dep’t of Cors., 114 Idaho 494, 757 P.2d 1213 (Ct. App. 1988).
    Defendant’s sentence, which included a four-year period of parole supervision after his release from one year incarceration, was reasonable because defendant was an alcoholic, this was his third conviction for driving while under the influence, and four months after he was arrested and charged in the instant case, he “went on a bender” and was hospitalized for alcohol detoxification.

        This section, which provides that the time spent on parole shall not be considered to have been served as a part of a prisoner’s sentence when that prisoner is recommitted following a parole violation, is constitutional and does not violate the separation of powers doctrine of Idaho Const., Art.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section did not violate the separation of powers where the legislature had the authority of establishing suitable punishment for various crimes; the legislative pronouncement that an inmate had to be subject to forfeiture of time spent on parole was an exercise of the legislative power to define crimes and their penalties and did not involve resentencing inmates; therefore, the statute did not violate the separation of powers.

        Inmate’s claim pertaining to Sentence 1 was properly dismissed where the Idaho commission of pardons and paroles had no authority in 1997 to permit credit against a sentence in the commission’s discretion. Acheson v. Klauser, 139 Idaho 156, 75 P.3d 210 (Ct. App. 2003).
    Inmate’s due process rights were not violated when, upon revoking his parole, the commission of pardons and parole forfeited 2,021 days the inmate had previously spent on parole after a prior parole violation, because the inmate was required to serve out the sentence. Mattoon v. Blades, 145 Idaho 634, 181 P.3d 1242 (2008), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

       <p>
        Appellate court conducted a proportionality analysis comparing the sentence to those imposed on other defendants for similar offenses, and the burden of demonstrating that a sentence was cruel and unusual was on the person asserting the constitutional violation; therefore, defendant had not shown an inference of gross disproportionality, including the additional time he spent in custody due to the forfeiture of the 314 days, such that defendant failed to demonstrate that his sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

        Revocation of defendant’s parole constituted enforcement of a statutorily authorized condition of parole, that the time spent on parole would not count towards the completion of the judicially imposed sentences; similar to probation revocation, the re-incarceration resulting from the violation of the terms of parole was not a separate punishment for defendant’s underlying criminal offenses, such that defendant’s double jeopardy claim failed.

        The fact that, when an inmate’s parole is revoked, the time that he spent on parole does not count towards the completion of the inmate’s sentence, unless the commission for pardons and parole decides in its discretion that the time should be so counted, does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and does not place him in double jeopardy.

        The rules of evidence applicable to a judicial proceeding need not be observed at a parole revocation hearing. Craig v. State, 123 Idaho 121, 844 P.2d 1371 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Clarification of Findings.
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is nothing which indicates that a court cannot remand to clarify findings, so long as the parole commission does not take additional evidence to supplement the record without providing a parolee due process. The record did not show that the commission supplemented the record in any way and accordingly the magistrate’s decision to remand the case without specifically delineating due process protections was sustained. Craig v. State, 123 Idaho 121, 844 P.2d 1371 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Drug Tests.
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was substantial evidence in the record to support the parole commission’s finding that defendant used cannabinoids in violation of his parole agreement. Defendant took two drug tests, over six months apart, and failed both, even though the test was designed to eliminate the possibility that passive inhalation would register. Craig v. State, 123 Idaho 121, 844 P.2d 1371 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Due Process.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Inmate’s due process rights were not violated because the commission on pardons and paroles rejected a hearing officer’s recommendation that the inmate be reinstated to parole; the commission had the sole authority to decide whether to revoke the inmate’s parole. Mattoon v. Blades, 145 Idaho 634, 181 P.3d 1242 (2008), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The procedural safeguards that must be provided in parole revocation proceedings in order to comport with the constitutional right to due process were outlined by the United States supreme court in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 485, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972). Matthews v. Jones, 147 Idaho 224, 207 P.3d 200 (Ct. App. 2009).

        Absent prejudice to the petitioner in his ability to present a defense caused by the delay, dismissal of parole violation charges and reinstatement of parole is not an available remedy for untimely entrance of a decision by a hearing officer.

        While this section and other parole revocation statutes can be read to vest final decision-making authority concerning revocation of parole in a single member of the commission or in a hearing officer, the parole revocation statutes, read in pari materia, vest authority to decide whether to revoke or continue parole solely in the full commission.

        Standard of Review.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A finding by the parole commission that a parole violation has occurred will not be overturned unless the reviewing court can say that the finding represents an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion will occur only if the finding of a violation is not supported by substantial reliable evidence or if the procedures followed deprive the parolee of due process. Craig v. State, 123 Idaho 121, 844 P.2d 1371 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plenary authority of the parole commission should not be disturbed in the absence of a clear abuse of its rightful discretion. The magistrate applied the correct standard of review to the commission’s decision to revoke parole once the magistrate was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that a parole violation had occurred. Craig v. State, 123 Idaho 121, 844 P.2d 1371 (Ct. App. 1992).

        The entire statutory scheme of Title 20 of the Idaho Code presupposes that state prisoners will be housed in the state prison under the control and custody of the department of correction and county prisoners will be housed in the county jails under the control and custody of the county sheriffs; therefore, the language “as soon as possible” contained in this section extends only to logistical and scheduling considerations of dispatching prison personnel to various jails throughout the state, but not to other operational considerations of the penitentiary.

    PURPOSE
     </h3>
     <p>
      The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the crime control act, 4 U.S.C. section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

      § 20-501. Legislative intent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the policy of the state of Idaho that the juvenile corrections system will be based on the following principles: accountability; community protection; and competency development. Where a juvenile has been found to be within the purview of the juvenile corrections act, the court shall impose a sentence that will protect the community, hold the juvenile offender accountable for his actions, and assist the juvenile offender in developing skills to become a contributing member of a diverse community. It is the further policy of the state of Idaho that the parents or other legal guardians of the juvenile offender participate in the accomplishment of these goals through participation in counseling and treatment designed to develop positive parenting skills and an understanding of the family’s role in the juvenile offender’s behavior. It is the further intent of the legislature that the parents of the juvenile offender be held accountable, where appropriate, through monetary reimbursement for supervision and confinement of the juvenile offender, and restitution to victims of the juvenile offender’s delinquent acts. In enacting this legislation, the legislature finds that the juvenile corrections system should encompass the following aspects: day treatment, community programs, observation and assessment programs, probation services, secure facilities, after-care and assistance to counties for juvenile offenders not committed to the custody of the department of juvenile corrections.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following is a brief description of what the legislature intends to become the components of Idaho’s juvenile corrections system:
     </p>
     <p>
      Probation. Probation officers would have twenty-four (24) hour on call responsibility for juvenile offenders and would monitor their activities on a continual basis. Probation officers would be responsible for assisting juvenile offenders and their families in accessing counseling or treatment resources, close supervision of juvenile offenders’ activities, supervision of restitution and coordination of other services provided to juvenile offenders. Juvenile offenders ordered into the custody of the department of juvenile corrections would be monitored by a county probation officer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Day treatment. Day treatment programs would be time limited nonresidential treatment and educational programs. Included in these programs would be trackers who would provide intensive supervision of juvenile offenders through daily contact and by counseling juvenile offenders regarding employment, education, courts, family and life skills. Nonresidential alcohol and drug programs would provide outpatient assessment and counseling for juvenile offenders with substance abuse problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Community programs. It is intended that community programs would exist throughout the state to provide twenty-four (24) hour residential supervision and treatment options to juvenile offenders in close proximity to their families and their community. It is intended that these programs would strengthen the juvenile offender’s relationship with family, engender a commitment to school and employment, promote the development of competency and life skills and help juvenile offenders generalize appropriate behavior into their environment.
    Observation and assessment. Regional observation and assessment centers would be provided, either directly or on a contract basis, to conduct observation and assessment of the juvenile offender in a short-term residential experience. It is intended that these programs would maintain standardized home and daily routines with intensive daily programming.
     </p>
     <p>
      Secure facilities. Secure facilities would provide secure confinement, discipline, education and treatment of the most seriously delinquent juvenile offenders. Programs at the secure facilities would be designed to help juvenile offenders recognize accountability for delinquent behavior by confronting and eliminating delinquent norms, criminal thinking and antisocial behavior and making restitution to victims through community service or other restitution programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the further intent of the legislature that the primary purpose of this act is to provide a continuum of programs which emphasize the juvenile offender’s accountability for his actions while assisting him in the development of skills necessary to function effectively and positively in the community in a manner consistent with public safety. These services and programs will individualize treatment and control of the juvenile offender for the benefit of the juvenile offender and the protection of society. It is legislative intent that the department of juvenile corrections be operated within the framework of the following principles to accomplish this mission:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol11">
       Provide humane, disciplined confinement to a juvenile offender who presents a danger to the community.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol12">
       Strengthen opportunities for the juvenile offender’s development of competency and life skills by expanding the juvenile offender’s access to applicable programs and community resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol13">
       Hold juvenile offenders accountable for their delinquent behavior through such means as victim restitution, community service programs and the sharing of correctional costs.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol14">
       Invoke the participation of the juvenile offender’s parent or legal guardian in assisting the juvenile offender to recognize and accept responsibility for his delinquent or other antisocial behavior and hold the parent accountable, where appropriate, through the payment of detention costs and restitution to victims and through attendance at programs for the development of positive parenting skills designed to promote a functional relationship between the juvenile offender and his family.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol15">
       Develop efficient and effective juvenile correctional programs within the framework of professional correctional standards, legislative intent and available resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol16">
       Provide for a diversity of innovative and effective programs through research on delinquent behavior and the continuous evaluation of correctional programs.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol17">
       Assist counties in developing meaningful programs for juvenile offenders who have come into the juvenile corrections system but who have not been committed to the custody of the department of juvenile corrections.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol18">
       Provide programs to increase public awareness of the mission of the juvenile corrections system and encourage public participation in developing an effective juvenile corrections system designed to aid in reducing juvenile crime in this state.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-501ol19">
       Develop and maintain a statewide juvenile offender information system.
      </li>

        In its revision and renumbering of the youth rehabilitation act, formerly chapter 18, title 16, Idaho Code, the legislature, pursuant to S.L. 1995, ch. 44, § 1 entitled the new provisions of chapter 5, title 20, Idaho Code, as the Juvenile Corrections Act.

       <p>
        The term “this act” near the beginning of the eighth paragraph was added to this section by S.L. 1989, ch. 155, § 1, but, since the revision of former chapter 18, title 16, Idaho Code, by S.L. 1995, chapter 44, the reference seems to be to chapter 5, title 20, Idaho Code, the Juvenile Corrections Act.

        Legislative Goal.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislative scheme — providing that a petition for the initial determination of whether a child is being adequately educated will be filed pursuant to the Youth Rehabilitation Act [now juvenile corrections act] (YRA) — is to ensure that a determination as to the adequacy of a child’s education is made by a court of competent jurisdiction without the stigma of criminal proceedings attaching; even more obvious is society’s objection, as expressed by the legislature in the enactment of the compulsory education statutes and the YRA, to have Idaho’s children educated so that they may be productive citizens not disadvantaged by lack of an education adequate to meet the demands of modern life. The goal is not to label children “juvenile delinquents” by bringing them before the courts, but to achieve society’s objective by positive and orderly resolution of the parties’ differences within an impartial legal framework. Bayes v. State, 117 Idaho 96, 785 P.2d 660 (Ct. App. 1989).

        The juvenile court had exclusive, original jurisdiction over adult defendant, pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-505" target="_self">§ 20-505</a></cite>, because defendant was a minor when he allegedly committed three counts of lewd conduct. However, this section’s last clause, teamed with its incorporation of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-508" target="_self">§ 20-508</a></cite>(2), demonstrates clear legislative intent to permit a juvenile court to entertain a motion to waive the defendant into adult criminal court, even if the court otherwise lacks jurisdiction.

      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol11">
       After the filing of a petition and after full investigation and hearing, the court may waive jurisdiction under the juvenile corrections act over the juvenile and order that the juvenile be held for adult criminal proceedings when:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol11a">
         A juvenile is alleged to have committed any of the crimes enumerated in section 20-509, Idaho Code; or

         A juvenile is alleged to have committed an act other than those enumerated in section 20-509, Idaho Code, after the child became fourteen (14) years of age which would be a crime if committed by an adult; or
        </li>
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol11c">
         An adult at the time of the filing of the petition is alleged to have committed an act prior to his having become eighteen (18) years of age which would be a felony if committed by an adult, and the court finds that the adult is not committable to an institution for people with intellectual disabilities or mental illness, is not treatable in any available institution or facility available to the state designed for the care and treatment of juveniles, or that the safety of the community requires the adult continue under restraint; or

       A motion to waive jurisdiction under the juvenile corrections act and prosecute a juvenile under the criminal law may be made by the prosecuting attorney, the juvenile, or by motion of the court upon its own initiative. The motion shall be in writing and contain the grounds and reasons in support thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol13">
       Upon the filing of a motion to waive jurisdiction under the juvenile corrections act, the court shall enter an order setting the motion for hearing at a time and date certain and shall order a full and complete investigation of the circumstances of the alleged offense to be conducted by county probation, or such other agency or investigation officer designated by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol14">
       Upon setting the time for the hearing upon the motion to waive jurisdiction, the court shall give written notice of said hearing to the juvenile, and the parents, guardian or custodian of the juvenile, and the prosecuting attorney, at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing, or a lesser period stipulated by the parties, and such notice shall inform the juvenile and the parents, guardian or custodian of the juvenile of their right to court appointed counsel. Service of the notice shall be made in the manner prescribed for service of a summons under section 20-512, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol15">
       The hearing upon the motion to waive jurisdiction shall be held in the same manner as an evidentiary hearing upon the original petition and shall be made part of the record.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol16">
       If as a result of the hearing on the motion to waive jurisdiction the court shall determine that jurisdiction should not be waived, the petition shall be processed in the customary manner as a juvenile corrections act proceeding. However, in the event the court determines, as a result of the hearing, that juvenile corrections act jurisdiction should be waived and the juvenile should be prosecuted under the criminal laws of the state of Idaho, the court shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which it bases such decision together with a decree waiving juvenile corrections act jurisdiction and binding the juvenile over to the authorities for prosecution under the criminal laws of the state of Idaho.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol17">
       No motion to waive juvenile corrections act jurisdiction shall be recognized, considered, or heard by the court in the same case once the court has entered an order or decree in that case that said juvenile has come within the purview of the juvenile corrections act, and all subsequent proceedings after the decree finding the juvenile within the purview of the act must be under and pursuant to the act and not as a criminal proceeding.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18">
       In considering whether or not to waive juvenile court jurisdiction over the juvenile, the juvenile court shall consider the following factors:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18a">
         The seriousness of the offense and whether the protection of the community requires isolation of the juvenile beyond that afforded by juvenile facilities;
        </li>
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18b">
         Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner;
        </li>
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18c">
         Whether the alleged offense was against persons or property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons;
        </li>
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18d">
         The maturity of the juvenile as determined by considerations of his home, environment, emotional attitude, and pattern of living;
        </li>
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18e">
         The juvenile’s record and previous history of contacts with the juvenile corrections system;
        </li>
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18f">
         The likelihood that the juvenile will develop competency and life skills to become a contributing member of the community by use of facilities and resources available to the court;
        </li>
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol18g">
         The amount of weight to be given to each of the factors listed in subsection (8) of this section is discretionary with the court, and a determination that the juvenile is not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law may be based on any one (1) or a combination of the factors set forth within this section, which shall be recited in the order of waiver.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol19">
       If the court does not waive jurisdiction and order a juvenile or adult held for criminal proceedings, the court in a county other than the juvenile’s or adult’s home county, after entering a decree that the juvenile or adult is within the purview of this chapter, may certify the case for sentencing to the court of the county in which the juvenile offender or adult resides upon being notified that the receiving court is willing to accept transfer. In the event of a transfer, which should be made unless the court finds it contrary to the interest of the juvenile offender or adult, the jurisdiction of the receiving court shall attach to the same extent as if the court had original jurisdiction.

      <li id="t20c05s20-508ol110">
       Upon conviction of a juvenile offender held for adult criminal proceedings under this section, the sentencing judge may, if a finding is made that adult sentencing measures would be inappropriate:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t20c05s20-508ol110a">

        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 308, updated the second section reference in subsection (10)(b).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 235, substituted “institution for people with intellectual disabilities or mental illness” for “institution for the mentally deficient or mentally ill” in paragraph (1)(c).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 19, inserted “offender” following “juvenile” near the end of the first sentence and near the middle of the last sentence in subsection (9) and in the introductory paragraph of subsection (10).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 113, rewrote paragraph (10)(b), which formerly read: “Sentence the convicted person to the county jail or to the custody of the state board of correction but suspend the sentence or withhold judgment pursuant to section 19-2601, Idaho Code, and commit the defendant to the custody of the department of juvenile corrections for an indeterminate period of time in accordance with section 20-520(1)(r), Idaho Code. The court, in its discretion, may order that the suspended sentence or withheld judgment be conditioned upon the convicted person’s full compliance with all reasonable program requirements of the department of juvenile corrections. Such a sentence may also set terms of probation, which may be served under the supervision of county juvenile probation. However, in no event may the total of the actual time spent by the convicted person in the custody of the department plus any adult sentence imposed by the court exceed the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime”; and deleted former paragraph (10)(c) which read: “If a convicted person is given a suspended sentence or withheld judgment conditioned upon the convicted person’s compliance with all reasonable program requirements of the department pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, and if the department reasonably believes that the convicted person is failing to comply with all reasonable program requirements, the department may petition the sentencing court to revoke the commitment to the department and transfer the convicted person to the county jail or to the custody of the state board of correction for the remainder of the sentence.”

        The magistrate did not abuse his discretion in waiving youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act) jurisdiction, where there was ample competent evidence in the record from which the magistrate reasonably concluded that defendant was a dangerous individual; that a real possibility existed that he would not be rehabilitated before he reached the age of 21; and that protection of the community required his isolation beyond that afforded by the juvenile facilities.

       </p>
       <p>
        A waiver decision will not be regarded as an abuse of discretion when the court: (1) perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) acted within the boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the available choices; and (3) reached its decision through an exercise of reason.

        It was entirely proper for the magistrate, in considering defendant’s record and history of previous contacts with the juvenile justice system, to allow testimony concerning his misdemeanor offenses and dismissed felony charges, inasmuch as there is nothing in the youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act) to indicate the legislature, in referring to a child’s “record” and “contacts with the juvenile justice system,” intended to limit the magistrate’s consideration to felony type conduct only.

        A probable cause finding in conjunction with the procedure of waiving juvenile jurisdiction is not required by the Idaho or federal constitutions, since, when a juvenile court waives jurisdiction, an adult court must still conduct a preliminary hearing at which probable cause must be determined and if juvenile jurisdiction is not waived a probable cause determination is made by the juvenile court as to whether and how to proceed on the juvenile petition. Wolf v. State, 99 Idaho 476, 583 P.2d 1011 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings to determine whether or not juvenile jurisdiction should be waived, where the magistrate found that each of the defendants was emotionally and mentally mature and that the prognosis for each defendant under available juvenile rehabilitation programs was unsatisfactory and that they would likely remain dangerous to the public if released at age 21 and in the interim each would be likely to disrupt the rehabilitation of other juveniles, such finding met the criteria necessary for waiver of jurisdiction set forth in
    State v, Gibbs
    , 94 Idaho 908, 500 P.2d 209 (1972). Wolf v. State, 99 Idaho 476, 583 P.2d 1011 (1978).

        Where district court chose to review decision of magistrate denying waiver of juvenile court jurisdiction as an appellate court and then elected to hear additional evidence that California was terminating its contract with Idaho to provide juvenile rehabilitation facilities, it was appropriate for the district court to weigh de novo the factors considered by the magistrate along with the factor established by the additional evidence; it was discretionary with the district court to base its decision on any one or a combination of these factors under subsection (8) of this section as long as the district court accepted those findings of the magistrate which were unaffected by the additional evidence. Dillard v. State, 101 Idaho 917, 623 P.2d 1294 (1981).
    Paragraph (8)(a) states only that the court must consider the seriousness of the offense and whether the protection of the community requires isolation beyond that of a juvenile facility. Nowhere in the statute is a defendant’s level of involvement or hierarchy in the scheme of the crime contemplated. State v. Cota-Medina, 163 Idaho 593, 416 P.3d 965 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (8)(b) language provides only whether the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, OR willful manner. The statute does not require that the offense be committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, AND willful manner. State v. Cota-Medina, 163 Idaho 593, 416 P.3d 965 (2018).
       </p>

        Magistrate court did not err in determining that the heroin trafficking was a crime against persons, rather than a crime against property, for purposes of paragraph (8)(c), given heroin’s undeniable harmful physical and psychological effects. State v. Cota-Medina, 163 Idaho 593, 416 P.3d 965 (2018).

        In proceeding to determine whether or not juvenile jurisdiction should be waived, the only determination by the magistrate was the existence of probable cause to justify transfer to the adult court and such determination could be based on hearsay and need not be tested by cross-examination and confrontation. Wolf v. State, 99 Idaho 476, 583 P.2d 1011 (1978).

        In the event a person between the ages of fourteen and eighteen is charged with or pleads guilty to any crime which is not specifically enumerated as an exception to youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act) jurisdiction under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-509" target="_self">§ 20-509 </a></cite>(or which is not included in the exceptions to juvenile court jurisdiction found in this section), the minor remains under the jurisdiction of the youth rehabilitation act; however, the prosecutor, the minor or the district court itself may file a motion pursuant to this section seeking to waive youth rehabilitation act jurisdiction. In that situation, the district court must follow the procedures set forth in this section, and hold a hearing to determine whether youth rehabilitation act jurisdiction should be waived. In the absence of the required motion and hearing, the minor remains under youth rehabilitation act jurisdiction for disposition. State v. Larios, 125 Idaho 727, 874 P.2d 538 (1994).

        Where the magistrate ordered a full investigation of the circumstances of the alleged offense and considered the results of the investigation prior to waiving juvenile jurisdiction, the magistrate complied with this section. Zamora v. State, 123 Idaho 192, 846 P.2d 194 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion by waiving a 15-year-old defendant into adult court for trial, because each factor considered was supported by substantial and competent evidence, including the young age of the victim and the seriousness of the alleged crimes of attempted murder, battery, and forcible penetration. State v. Doe (In re Doe), 147 Idaho 243, 207 P.3d 974 (2009).

        The magistrate’s order waiving its jurisdiction over a juvenile is a final order of the magistrate’s court and must be appealed to the district court prior to further proceedings in district court in the matter. State v. Tipton, 99 Idaho 670, 587 P.2d 305 (1978).
    Although a hearing was required before defendant could waive jurisdiction to district court for charges stemming from conduct that occurred when he was a minor, defendant waived the issue by failing to object to the lack of such a hearing before appeal. State v. Kavajecz, 139 Idaho 482, 80 P.3d 1083 (2003).

        Jurisdiction ordinarily is waived when (1) the defendant has acquired such a degree of emotional or mental maturity that he is not receptive to rehabilitative programs designed for children; (2) although the defendant is immature his disturbance has eluded exhaustive prior efforts at correction through existing juvenile programs; or (3) the defendant is immature and might be treated, but the nature of his difficulty is likely to render him dangerous to the public, if released at age twenty-one or to disrupt the rehabilitation of other children in the program prior to his release. State v. Gibbs, 94 Idaho 908, 500 P.2d 209 (1972).
    A valid waiver of jurisdiction must be based on a specific finding, supported by substantial and competent evidence obtained in the full investigation required by this section, that the defendant is not amenable to rehabilitative treatment under juvenile court jurisdiction.

        This section was amended by two 2000 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2000 amendment, by ch. 73, § 1, in subsection (1), inserted “years” following “fourteen (14)”, in subdivision (1)(i), inserted “(1)” following “or on one”; in subsection (3), inserted “pursuant to this section or section 20-508, Idaho Code” following “indicted or transferred”; and made minor punctuation and stylistic changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2000 amendment, by ch. 246, § 3, in subsection (1), inserted “years” following “fourteen (14)”, in subdivision (1)(i), inserted “(1)” following “or on one”; in subsection (3), added “Except as otherwise allowed by subsection (4) of this section,”; rewrote the introductory language of subsection (4) which formerly read: “The sentencing judge of any juvenile convicted pursuant to this section may choose to sentence the convicted person in accordance with the juvenile sentencing options set forth in this act, if a finding is made that adult sentencing measures would be inappropriate”; and added subdivision (4)(a) through (4)(c); and made minor punctuation and stylistic changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 308, updated the second section reference in subsection (4)(b).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 352, rewrote paragraph (1)(c), which read: “Rape, but excluding statutory rape”; and added paragraph (1)(d) and redesignated the subsequent paragraphs in subsection (1).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 19, inserted “offender” following “juvenile” three times in subsection (3) and in the introductory paragraph of subsection (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 113, rewrote paragraph (4)(b), which formerly read: “Sentence the convicted person to the county jail or to the custody of the state board of correction but suspend the sentence or withhold judgment pursuant to section 19-2601, Idaho Code, and commit the defendant to the custody of the department of juvenile corrections for an indeterminate period of time in accordance with section 20-520(1)(r), Idaho Code. The court, in its discretion, may order that the suspended sentence or withheld judgment be conditioned upon the convicted person’s full compliance with all reasonable program requirements of the department of juvenile corrections. Such a sentence may also set terms of probation, which may be served under the supervision of county juvenile probation. However, in no event may the total of the actual time spent by the convicted person in the custody of the department plus any adult sentence imposed by the court exceed the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime.”; and deleted former paragraph (4)(c), which read: “If a convicted person is given a suspended sentence or withheld judgment conditioned upon the convicted person’s compliance with all reasonable program requirements of the department pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, and if the department reasonably believes that the convicted person is failing to comply with all reasonable program requirements, the department may petition the sentencing court to revoke the commitment to the department and transfer the convicted person to the county jail or to the custody of the state board of correction for the remainder of the sentence”.
    The 2016 amendment, by ch. 296, deleted former paragraph (1)(d), which read: “Male rape as defined in section 18-6108, Idaho Code” and redesignated the subsequent paragraphs accordingly.

       <p>
        Section 20-506, governing the transfer of juveniles, is operative only when the juvenile court has jurisdiction to proceed; this section, however, excludes certain crimes ab initio from juvenile court jurisdiction. Thus, there is no conflict between these sections, since<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-506" target="_self">§ 20-506 </a></cite>is not applicable to those cases coming within the purview of this section. State v. Anderson, 108 Idaho 454, 700 P.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1985).

       <p>
        This section applies to persons who are age 14 years to age 18 years at the time the act is committed. State v. Anderson, 108 Idaho 454, 700 P.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because lewd conduct with a minor under the age of 16 was not an enumerated offense under this section for which defendant could have been tried as an adult, defendant could not be tried for or convicted of that crime, which would otherwise have been a criminal act if committed by someone over the age of 14, where the evidence showed that he was 13 years old for most of the period during which the sexual conduct at issue occurred. State v. Kavajecz, 139 Idaho 482, 80 P.3d 1083 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion by waiving a 15-year-old defendant into adult court for trial, because each factor considered was supported by substantial and competent evidence, including the young age of the victim and the seriousness of the alleged crimes of attempted murder, battery, and forcible penetration. State v. Doe (In re Doe), 147 Idaho 243, 207 P.3d 974 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in rejecting defendant’s claim that the automatic waiver provision of this section constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Defendant, charged and convicted for poisoning food, medicine, or wells, had no statutory right to be proceeded against as a minor and was never entitled to the advantage of being proceeded against as a minor. State v. Jensen, 161 Idaho 243, 385 P.3d 5 (Ct. App. 2016).

       <p>
        Where defendant did not contend there was any error in court’s decision to sentence him as an adult, nor did the record on appeal indicate that he ever requested that the court impose sentence pursuant to the youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act of 1995), no error was shown with respect to the district court’s consideration of the best interests of defendant. State v. Moore, 127 Idaho 780, 906 P.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1995).

        Consideration of Age.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In deciding whether a 14-year-old defendant should be sentenced as an adult at the sentencing hearing, the trial court considered defendant’s youth and what was in defendant’s best interest. This was the appropriate time for the trial court to give special consideration to these factors. State v. Broadhead, 120 Idaho 141, 814 P.2d 401 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the best interest of the child is not one of the goals of sentencing to be considered when a juvenile is sentenced as an adult, a juvenile defendant’s age is one of the many circumstances that a sentencing court may and should consider in fashioning an appropriate sentence. State v. Moore, 127 Idaho 780, 906 P.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen is charged with one of the enumerated crimes in this section, he or she will be automatically waived into adult court, focusing on the juvenile’s age at the time he or she allegedly committed the offense. State v. Doe (In re Doe), 147 Idaho 243, 207 P.3d 974 (2009).

        Equal Protection.
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section does not violate the fourteenth amendment’s equal protection clause, because the classification barring violent youthful offenders from juvenile rehabilitation centers bears a rational relationship to an important legislative objective of excluding minors who commit certain violent acts from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. State v. Anderson, 108 Idaho 454, 700 P.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1985).

        Where an indictment, charging juvenile defendant with battery with intent to commit rape and burglary in the second degree, as drafted failed to allege an intent to commit forcible rape, the indictment did not charge any offense for which defendant could be prosecuted automatically as an adult under this section, so as to confer jurisdiction upon the district court. State v. Juhasz, 124 Idaho 851, 865 P.2d 178 (Ct. App. 1993).

        In the event a person between the ages of fourteen and eighteen is charged with or pleads guilty to any crime which is not specifically enumerated as an exception to youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act) jurisdiction under this section (or which is not included in the exceptions to juvenile court jurisdiction found in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-505" target="_self">§ 20-505</a></cite>), the minor remains under the jurisdiction of the youth rehabilitation act; however, the prosecutor, the minor or the district court itself may file a motion pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-508" target="_self">§ 20-508 </a></cite>seeking to waive youth rehabilitation act jurisdiction. In that situation, the district court must follow the procedures set forth in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-508" target="_self">§ 20-508</a></cite>, and hold a hearing to determine whether youth rehabilitation act jurisdiction should be waived. In the absence of the required motion and hearing, the minor remains under youth rehabilitation act jurisdiction for disposition. State v. Larios, 125 Idaho 727, 874 P.2d 538 (1994).

       <p>
        After considering defendant’s age and the nature and circumstance of his crime, 25-year term of confinement was not grossly disproportionate where he killed another human being by shooting the victim four times at point-blank range without any provocation, as the utter disregard for human life demonstrated in the commission of crime, coupled with the fact that it was committed against a law enforcement officer, might well have led to imposition of the death penalty or a fixed life sentence if the perpetrator had been an adult, and under circumstances, even in view of defendant’s youth, court could not say that the sentence was out of all proportion to the gravity of the offense or such as to shock the conscience of reasonable people. State v. Moore, 127 Idaho 780, 906 P.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a juvenile has been prosecuted as an adult, the appropriate time to take into account the juvenile’s best interests with respect to sentencing is in deciding whether to sentence the defendant as an adult under subsection (3) of this section or to utilize the juvenile sentencing options presented in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-520" target="_self">§ 20-520</a></cite>. State v. Moore, 127 Idaho 780, 906 P.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of whether the district judge had authority under this section to enhance the defendant’s sentence addressed the “legality” of the actual sentence, not the underlying conviction, and was properly brought through a motion under Idaho R. Crim. P. 35. State v. Burnight, 132 Idaho 654, 978 P.2d 214 (1999).
    By giving the sentencing judge the option to sentence a juvenile automatically waived into adult jurisdiction as a juvenile, the statute is premised on the assumption that adult sentencing options are not only available to the judge, but are the options with which the judge should work. State v. Burnight, 132 Idaho 654, 978 P.2d 214 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant’s motion to be sentenced as a juvenile where a four-year sentence was the maximum sentence defendant could have received under the juvenile corrections act, and the district court found that such a sentence was inappropriate for the crimes committed in this case. State v. Shanahan, 133 Idaho 896, 994 P.2d 1059 (Ct. App. 1999).

        Miller v. Alabama
    , 567 U.S. 460, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012), requires a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender’s youth and attendant characteristics before determining that life without parole is a proportionate sentence and
        Montgomery v. Louisiana
        , 136 S. Ct. 718, 193 L. Ed. 2d 599 (2016). declared that
        Miller
        was retroactive not only for those juveniles sentenced to a mandatory of life without parole, but also for those for whom the sentencing court imposed a fixed-life sentence without considering the distinctive attributes of youth. Windom v. State, 162 Idaho 417, 398 P.3d 150 (2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 977, 200 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2018).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any peace officer, any prosecuting attorney, or any authorized representative of the board of trustees of a school district of this state, having knowledge of a juvenile who is within the purview of this act may file a petition with the court in such form as may be required by the court, except a peace officer may also issue a citation for a curfew violation pursuant to section 20-549, Idaho Code. Said individual or agency shall be responsible for providing the evidence to support the allegations made in the petition, provided this in no way shall relieve peace officers from enforcement of the law as set forth in section 31-2227, Idaho Code. The court may make a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the interests of the public or of the juvenile require that further action be taken. Such inquiry may be made through the county probation officer or such other agent or investigation officer designated by the court. Thereupon, the court may make such informal adjustment as is practicable, or dismiss the petition, or set the matter for hearing. If an informal adjustment is made, it shall provide for full or partial restitution in the manner and form prescribed by the court when the offense involves loss or damage of property of another. A probation officer shall not file a petition unless the juvenile has previously been under the jurisdiction of the court. The petition and all subsequent court documents shall be entitled “In the interest of ..., a juvenile under eighteen (18) years of age.” The petition may be made upon information and belief but it shall be made under oath. It shall set forth plainly: (1) the facts which bring the juvenile within the purview of this act; (2) the name, age, and residence of the juvenile; (3) the names and residences of his parents and spouse, if any; (4) the name and residence of his legal guardian, if there be one, or the person or persons having custody or control of the juvenile, or of the nearest known relative if no parent or guardian can be found. If any of the facts herein required are not known by the petitioner the petition shall so state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Service of a petition upon the parents, legal guardian or person or persons having custody or control of the juvenile shall subject the parents, legal guardian or person or persons having custody or control of the juvenile to the provisions of this chapter. The petition shall inform the parents, legal guardian or other person legally obligated to care for and support the juvenile that service of the petition upon them shall make them subject to the provisions of this chapter.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20c05s20-511ol11">
       Prior to the filing of any petition under this act, the prosecuting attorney may request a preliminary inquiry from the county probation officer to determine whether the interest of the public or the juvenile requires a formal court proceeding. If court action is not required, the prosecuting attorney may utilize the diversion process and refer the case directly to the county probation officer or a community-based diversion program for informal probation and counseling. If the diversion process is utilized pursuant to this subsection, then statements made by a juvenile in a diversion proceeding shall be inadmissible at an adjudicative proceeding on the underlying charge as substantive evidence of guilt. If community service is going to be utilized pursuant to this subsection, the prosecuting attorney shall collect a fee of sixty cents (60¢) per hour for each hour of community service work the juvenile is going to perform and remit the fee to the state insurance fund for the purpose of securing worker’s compensation insurance for the juvenile offender performing community service. However, if a county is self-insured and provides worker’s compensation insurance for persons performing community service pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, then remittance to the state insurance fund is not required.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-511ol12">
       After the petition has been filed and where the juvenile offender admits to the allegations contained in the petition, the court may decide to make an informal adjustment of the petition. Informal adjustment includes, but is not limited to:

       Information uniquely identifying the juvenile offender, the offense, and the type of program utilized shall be forwarded to the department.

Access to the information shall be controlled by the department, subject to the provisions of section 74-113, Idaho Code.

       Such informal adjustment of the petition shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by the Idaho juvenile rules. When an informal adjustment is made pursuant to this section and the juvenile offender is to perform community service work, the court shall assess the juvenile offender a fee of sixty cents (60¢) per hour for each hour of community service work the juvenile offender is to perform. This fee shall be remitted by the court to the state insurance fund for the purpose of securing worker’s compensation insurance for the juvenile offender performing community service. However, if a county is self-insured and provides worker’s compensation insurance for persons performing community service pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, then remittance to the state insurance fund is not required.

       A judge of any court shall order the department of health and welfare to submit appropriate mental health assessments and a plan of treatment for the court’s approval if at any stage of a proceeding under this chapter or the child protective act, chapter 16, title 16, Idaho Code, a judge has reason to believe, based upon the record and proceedings of the court or upon an affidavit of a party, state or county agency or any person having physical custody of the juvenile or juvenile offender, that he or she:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t20c05s20-511Aol11a">
         Is suffering a substantial increase or persistence of a serious emotional disturbance as defined in section 16-2403, Idaho Code, which impairs his or her ability to comply with the orders and directives of the court, or which presents a risk to his or her safety or well-being or the safety of others; and

       The court may convene a screening team consisting of representatives from the department of health and welfare, county probation, local school officials, teen early intervention specialists as provided for under section 16-2404A, Idaho Code, the department of juvenile corrections and/or other agencies or persons designated by the court to review the plan of treatment and provide written recommendations to the court. Parents and guardians of the juvenile or juvenile offender, if available, shall be included in the screening team and consulted with regard to the plan of treatment.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-511Aol13">
       If the court, after receiving the mental health assessment and plan of treatment submitted by the department of health and welfare and any recommendations from the screening team, determines that additional information is necessary to determine whether the conditions set forth in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) of this section are present, or to determine an appropriate plan of treatment for the juvenile or juvenile offender, the court may order an evaluation and/or recommendations for treatment to be furnished by a psychiatrist, licensed physician or licensed psychologist, with the expenses of such evaluation and/or recommendations to be borne by the department of health and welfare.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-511Aol14">
       If the court concludes that the conditions set forth in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) of this section are present, the plan of treatment, as approved by the court, shall be entered into the record as an order of the court. The department of health and welfare shall provide mental health treatment as designated by the approved plan of treatment. If in-patient or residential treatment is required as part of the plan of treatment, the court shall hold a hearing on whether to order such treatment unless the hearing is waived by the juvenile or juvenile offender and his or her parents or guardians. The court may order parents, legal guardians or custodians to adhere to the treatment designated in the plan of treatment. Representatives from the department of health and welfare, county probation, local school officials, teen early intervention specialists as provided for under section 16-2404A, Idaho Code, the department of juvenile corrections and/or other agencies or persons designated by the court shall attend case review hearings as scheduled by the court.
    (5) All costs associated with assessment and treatment shall be the responsibility of the parents of the juvenile or juvenile offender according to their ability to pay based upon the sliding fee scale established pursuant to section 16-2433, Idaho Code. The financial obligation of the family shall be determined after consideration of all available payment and funding sources including title XIX of the social security act, as amended, all available third party sources, and parent resources according to any order for child support under chapter 10, title 32, Idaho Code. Services shall not be conditioned upon transfer of custody or parental rights.

      After a petition shall have been filed and after such further investigation as the court may direct, and if the matter is set for hearing, the court shall issue a summons requiring the person or persons who have custody or control of the juvenile to appear personally and bring the juvenile before the court at a time and place stated; provided, however, if hearing is to be held, it shall be held not later than fifteen (15) days after the summons is issued unless the court should order on being shown cause that the time be extended. If the person so summoned shall be other than a parent or guardian of the juvenile, then the parent or guardian or both shall also be notified of the pendency of the case and of the time and place appointed for the hearing. Notice shall be given as hereinafter provided. A subpoena may be issued requiring the appearance of any other person whose presence is required by the juvenile, his guardian or any other person who, in the opinion of the judge, is necessary. If it appears the juvenile is in such condition or surroundings that his welfare requires that he be taken into custody immediately, the judge, as provided in section 20-516, Idaho Code, may order by endorsement upon the summons that the officer serving the same shall at once take the juvenile into custody and bring him before the court.

      § 20-513. Service of summons — Travel expenses.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Service of summons shall be made personally by delivery of an attested copy thereof to the person summoned; provided that if the judge is satisfied that it is impracticable to serve personally such summons or the notice provided for in the preceding section, he may order service by registered mail addressed to the last known address, or by publication thereof, or both. It shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction if service is effected at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time fixed in the summons for the hearing. When publication is used the summons shall be published in two (2) consecutive issues of a weekly newspaper printed and published in the county; such newspaper to be designated by the court in the order for publication of the summons, and such publication shall have the same force and effect as though such person had been personally served with said summons. Service of summons, process or notice required by this act shall be made by the sheriff or a probation officer upon the request of the court and a return must be made by the sheriff on the summons showing that such service has been made. The judge may authorize payment of any necessary travel expenses incurred by any person summoned or otherwise required to appear at the hearing of any case coming within the purview of this act, and such expenses when approved by the judge shall be a charge upon the county, except that not more than five (5) witnesses on behalf of any parent or guardian may be required to attend such hearing at the expense of the county. The court may summon the appearance of any person whose presence is deemed necessary as a witness or possible resource for the care and treatment of the juvenile, including persons whom the juvenile or the family wishes to have present.

        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 222, added “Representation at all stages of proceedings” and “Waiver” in the section heading; added subsections (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6); redesignated former subsection (1) as subsection (4) and inserted “except as provided in subsection (6) of this section” in the second sentence in that subsection; redesignated former subsection (2) as subsection (7) and rewrote that subsection; and redesignated former subsection (3) as subsection (8), substituted “the juvenile, as provided in subsection (7) of this section” for “the juvenile, his parents or guardian under this section” at the end of the first sentence.

        The indigent youthful offender (and his parent) and the indigent adult offender are entitled to an order of the court providing legal representation. James v. Dunlap, 100 Idaho 697, 604 P.2d 711 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the attorney has been deprived of a realistic opportunity to assist his client, the issue is not one of ineffective counsel, it is one of counsel denied. The right to counsel is so basic to our notions of fair trial and due process that denial of the right is never treated as harmless error; such denial requires setting aside an adjudication under the youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act), and a remand for further proceedings in which counsel is timely provided. Kinley v. State, 108 Idaho 862, 702 P.2d 900 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the county public defender appointed to represent the accused had only 15 minutes to speak with the accused and go over the case, and accordingly moved for a continuance in order to prepare a defense, to which the prosecutor did not object, the magistrate’s denial of the continuance amounted to a denial of the right to counsel in violation of this section and Idaho Juvenile Rule 3 and constituted an abuse of discretion.

       A peace officer may take a juvenile into custody upon a written order or warrant signed by a judge. The judge may issue the order or warrant after finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile comes within the purview of this chapter.

Such written promise shall be submitted to the court as soon as possible.

        This section was amended by two 1996 acts which do not appear to conflict and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 259, § 1, inserted the present subsection designation “(2)”; added subsection (3); redesignated former subsections (2) through (7) as present subsections (4) through (9); and in present subsection (8), in the second sentence, deleted “at a detention facility by staff of the facility” following “taken of juveniles” and substituted “juvenile fingerprint file and enter the fingerprint data into the automated fingerprint identification system” for “juvenile file, separate and apart from any adult file, in a records system”, added the third sentence, and in the fourth sentence, substituted “good cause it may” for “a juvenile’s detention for an offense to be unlawful, the court shall” and substituted “expunged” for “taken pursuant to that detention expunged, unless the court, after a hearing, orders otherwise”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 379, § 2, in subdivision (1)(a), inserted “misdemeanor or” preceding “felony”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 19, substituted “detention center” for “detention facility” in paragraph (4)(e) and in subsection (5); and, in subsection (8), deleted the former third and fourth sentences, which read, “The fingerprint data shall then be forwarded to the department to be maintained in a statewide juvenile offender information system. Access to the information in the juvenile offender system shall be controlled by the department, subject to the provisions of section 9-342, Idaho Code” and inserted “offender” following “juvenile” in the last two sentences.
    The 2015 amendment, by ch. 141, substituted “chapter 1, title 74” for “chapter 3, title 9” in subsection (9).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2016 amendment, by ch. 344, rewrote paragraph (1)(c), which formerly read: “When there are reasonable grounds to believe the juvenile has committed a status offense. Status offenses are truancy, running away from or being beyond the control of parents, guardian, or legal custodian and curfew violations. Status offenders shall not be placed in any jail facility but instead may be placed in juvenile shelter care facilities, except in the case of runaways, when there is a specific detention request from a foreign jurisdiction to hold the juvenile pending transportation arrangements.”

       Juvenile detention centers must be so constructed and/or maintained as to keep juveniles segregated from adult offenders with there to be no contact as to sight and/or sound between the two (2) classes. Those juveniles being treated as adult offenders pursuant to section 20-508 or 20-509, Idaho Code, may be housed in a juvenile detention center if so ordered by the court. Such juveniles may be housed in the general juvenile population without sight and sound separation if it is determined by the detention administration that the safety and security of the other juveniles would not be at risk.

        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 7, in subsection (1), deleted “or those being treated as adult offenders under section 20-508 or 20-509, Idaho Code” following “adult offenders” in the first sentence and added the second and third sentences; substituted “juveniles” for “juvenile detainees” in subsection (2); substituted “Books, newspapers and periodicals from any source are subject” for “Detained juveniles may receive books, newspapers and periodicals from any source including delivery to the detention facilities by family members, subject” in the second sentence of subsection (4); and added subsection (6) and redesignated the subsequent subsection accordingly.
    The 2012 amendment, by ch. 19, substituted “detention centers” for “detention facilities” and “detention center” for “detention facility” throughout the section; and, in subsection (4), rewrote the second sentence, which formerly read: “Books, newspapers and periodicals from any source are subject to the right of detention authorities to inspect and remove dangerous or harmful materials.”

     <p>
      If the juvenile denies the allegations in the petition, the court shall conduct a full evidentiary hearing, in the manner prescribed by the Idaho juvenile rules. The juvenile shall have the right to call witnesses on his own behalf. A record shall be made in all proceedings connected with the case and shall be preserved in the event of appeal. If at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing the court finds the juvenile to come within the purview of the act, the court shall so rule, and then shall set the matter down for sentencing, or may, in the interest of time, hold a sentencing hearing at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing if all information necessary to the disposition of the case is available at the time.

      When a juvenile, other than the juvenile against whom the petition has been filed, is summoned as a witness in any hearing under this act, notwithstanding any other statutory provision, parents, a counselor, a friend or other person having a supportive relationship with the juvenile shall, if available, be permitted to remain in the courtroom at the witness stand with the juvenile during the juvenile’s testimony unless, in written findings made and entered, the court finds that the juvenile’s constitutional right to a fair trial will be unduly prejudiced.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20c05s20-519Aol11">
       At any time after the filing of a delinquency petition, a party may request in writing, or the court on its own motion may order, that the juvenile be examined to determine if the juvenile is competent to proceed. The request shall state the facts in support of the request for a competency examination. If, based upon the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, the court determines that there is good cause to believe that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed, then the court shall stay all proceedings and appoint at least one (1) examiner who shall be a qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, or shall order the department of health and welfare to designate, within two (2) business days, at least one (1) examiner who shall be a qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, to examine and report upon the mental condition of the juvenile. If there is reason to believe the basis for the juvenile’s incompetency is due to a developmental disability, the court shall appoint an evaluation committee as defined in section 66-402, Idaho Code, or shall order the department of health and welfare to designate, within two (2) business days, an evaluation committee, to examine and report upon the mental condition of the juvenile. The county shall be responsible for the cost of such evaluation subject to any reimbursement by the parents or other legal guardian of the juvenile. The court may order the parents or other legal guardian of the juvenile, unless indigent, to contribute to the costs of such examination in an amount to be set by the court after due notice to the parent or other legal guardian and the opportunity to be heard.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-519Aol12">
       A juvenile is competent to proceed if he or she has:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t20c05s20-519Aol12a">
         A sufficient present ability to consult with his or her lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding;

       Within three (3) business days of the appointment or designation of an examiner or an evaluation committee pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the examiner or evaluation committee shall determine the best location for the examination. The examination shall be conducted on an outpatient basis unless the court specifically finds that hospitalization or confinement of the juvenile for evaluation of competency is necessary, the juvenile is currently hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital or the juvenile is detained. The court may order the juvenile be confined to a hospital or other suitable facility, including detention as defined in section 20-502, Idaho Code, after a hearing to determine whether such confinement is necessary. Any such confinement shall be for the purpose of examination and shall be for a period not exceeding ten (10) days from the date of admission to the hospital or other suitable facility. The court, upon request, may make available to the examiner or the evaluation committee any court records relating to the juvenile.
    (4) The examiner or evaluation committee may employ any method of examination that is accepted by the examiner’s profession for the examination of juveniles alleged not to be competent, provided that such examination shall, at a minimum, include formal assessments of the juvenile in each of the following domains:
       <ol Class="alpha">

      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (5) If at any time during the examination process, the examiner has reason to believe that the juvenile’s alleged incompetency may be the result of a developmental disability and the matter has not already been referred to an evaluation committee for review, the examiner shall immediately notify the court. The court shall appoint an evaluation committee, or shall order the department of health and welfare to designate, within two (2) business days, an evaluation committee, to examine and report upon the mental condition of the juvenile. Conversely, if at any time during the examination process an evaluation committee has reason to believe the juvenile’s alleged incompetency is not the result of a developmental disability, the evaluation committee shall immediately notify the court so the examination can be completed by a qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist as set forth in subsection (1) of this section. The new examination and report shall be conducted within the time frames set forth in subsection (6) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) The examiner or evaluation committee shall submit a written report to the court within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appointment or designation. The report shall address the factors set forth in section 20-519B, Idaho Code. If the examiner or evaluation committee determines that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed, the report shall also include the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) The nature of the mental disease, defect, disability or other condition including chronological age that is the cause of the juvenile’s incompetency;
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) The juvenile’s prognosis;
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) Whether the examiner or evaluation committee believes the juvenile may be restored to competency and an estimated time period in which competence could be restored with treatment;
     </p>
     <p>
      (d) If the juvenile may be restored to competency, the recommendations for restoration shall be the least restrictive alternative that is consistent with public safety;
     </p>
     <p>
      (e) If the juvenile is not competent and there is no substantial probability that the juvenile can be restored to competency within six (6) months, a recommendation as to whether the juvenile meets the criteria set forth in section 16-2418, 66-329(11) or 66-406(11), Idaho Code, and identification of any other services recommended for the juvenile that are the least restrictive, community based and consistent with public safety; and
     </p>
     <p>
      (7) The court, upon a finding of good cause, may alter the time frames for the designation of an examiner or evaluation committee, the completion of the examination or the completion of the report but shall ensure that the examination and competency determination occur as expeditiously as possible. The court may, upon a finding of good cause, vacate or continue the ninety (90) day restoration review hearing set forth in section 20-519C, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) The report of the examination shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the juvenile.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) If the examination cannot be conducted by reason of the unwillingness of the juvenile to participate, the report shall so state and shall include, if possible, an opinion as to whether such unwillingness of the juvenile was the result of age, mental disease, defect or disability and whether the examiner recommends that a second examiner be appointed to examine the juvenile.

Prior to a stay or dismissal of the matter, the court may convene a screening team consisting of representatives from the department of health and welfare, county probation, local school officials, and/or other agencies or persons designated by the court to develop a treatment plan for the juvenile. In developing such treatment plan, the recommendations contained in the competency examination shall be considered to ensure necessary services for the juvenile are put into place.

      (7) If the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed, but may be restored to competency, the court may order a juvenile to participate in the competency restoration program as developed by the department of health and welfare. The purpose of the treatment or training is the restoration of the juvenile’s competency to proceed. In determining the type and location of the competency restoration program and in designating a restoration provider, the department of health and welfare shall identify the least restrictive alternative that is consistent with public safety and consider whether inpatient treatment, residential care or secure confinement is necessary for program participation.

      (a) An inpatient or residential or secure detention facility is only appropriate if all available less restrictive alternatives in community settings which would offer an opportunity for improvement of the juvenile’s condition are inappropriate. If the department of health and welfare’s plan of restoration requires the juvenile be placed in an inpatient, residential or secure detention facility, the court shall hold a hearing on whether to order such placement unless the hearing is waived by the juvenile and the juvenile’s parents or guardians. Juveniles charged with only a status offense or multiple status offenses shall not be held in a secure confinement or detention facility for restoration purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) The department of health and welfare is responsible for determining the competency restoration program and services. All costs associated with restoration services shall be the responsibility of the parents of the juvenile according to their ability to pay based upon the sliding fee scale established pursuant to section 16-2433, Idaho Code. The financial obligation of the parents shall be determined after consideration of all available payment and funding sources including title XIX of the social security act, as amended, all available third party sources including funding available to the juvenile from other programs, grants or agencies and parent resources according to any order for child support under chapter 10, title 32, Idaho Code. Services shall not be conditioned upon transfer of custody of parental rights.
    (8) If a juvenile is determined to be incompetent to proceed but may be restored to competency, the court shall retain jurisdiction of the juvenile for up to six (6) months. A restoration order issued pursuant to this section is valid for six (6) months from the date of the initial finding of incompetency or until one (1) of the following, whichever occurs first:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) The restoration program submits a report that the juvenile has become competent to proceed or that there is no substantial probability that the juvenile will regain competency within the period the order is valid;
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) The charges are dismissed; or
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) The juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years of age.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) The court may extend the restoration order beyond six (6) months upon a showing of good cause. If the juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years of age, the matter shall be dismissed. If the court concludes that there is no substantial probability that the juvenile will regain competency within the period the order is valid, then the provisions of subsection (5) of this section shall apply.

       Upon the entry of an order finding the juvenile offender is within the purview of the act, the court shall then hold a sentencing hearing in the manner prescribed by the Idaho juvenile rules to determine the sentence that will promote accountability, competency development and community protection. Prior to the entry of an order disposing of the case, other than an order of discharge or dismissal, the court may request and, if requested, shall receive a report containing the results of an inquiry into the home environment, past history, competency development, prevention or out of home placement services provided, and the social, physical and mental condition of the juvenile offender.

        Formal sentencing and informal adjustment are mutually exclusive pathways for resolving juvenile petitions. Therefore, the juvenile defendant is subject to either formal sentencing or informal adjustment. Once the magistrate court formally sentences a juvenile to two years’ probation under paragraph (1)(a), it has no authority to convert the judgment into an informal adjustment under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t20c05s20-511" target="_self">§ 20-511 </a></cite>and Idaho Juv.

        Where defendant did not contend there was any error in court’s decision to sentence him as an adult, nor did the record on appeal indicate that he ever requested that the court impose sentence pursuant to the youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act of 1995), no error was shown with respect to the district court’s consideration of the best interests of defendant.

        When appellants’ minor daughter was placed on probation for petit theft, the magistrate court violated appellants’ Fourth Amendment rights by requiring appellants to submit to random urine testing for drugs; while the magistrate had the authority to impose the probation condition under subsection (1)(j) of this section, requiring appellants to undergo urinalysis testing constituted a search that was presumptively invalid without a warrant.

        Because a restitution award is imposed solely as a result of misbehavior on the part of the juvenile, and is a part of the state court’s sentence in every case, except “where inappropriate or undesirable,” application of the juvenile corrections act against a parent is more a device to provide the victim with an opportunity to recover any economic loss, than a means to punish or rehabilitate the parent. Mabey v. Ellis, 224 Bankr. 786 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff’s damages exceeded the limits under state law for recovery from a juvenile’s parents in a civil action, the liability of the parents for payment of a restitution award did not constitute a fine, penalty, or forfeiture. Mabey v. Ellis, 224 Bankr. 786 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court has discretion in determining the amount of the obligation owed a victim, and a restitution order need not be considered compensation for actual pecuniary loss simply because it matches the victim’s loss. Mabey v. Ellis, 224 Bankr. 786 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding restitution for lost earnings in the amount of $3,300 to the father and $2,700 to the mother of a four-year-old child, upon whom a juvenile defendant was found guilty of committing lewd conduct, where the awards were based on each parent’s gross earnings per day and days missed from work for matters related to the criminal action.

      If a juvenile offender has successfully completed and graduated from an authorized juvenile drug court program, juvenile mental health court program or other authorized problem solving court program and, during any period of probation that may have been served following such graduation, has satisfied the terms or conditions of the probation, the court may, if convinced by the showing made that there is no longer cause for continuing the period of probation, and if it be compatible with the public interest, terminate the juvenile’s sentence, set aside the adjudication of the juvenile offender finding the juvenile offender within the purview of the juvenile corrections act, and finally dismiss the case and discharge the juvenile offender from the jurisdiction of the court.

      § 20-524. Support of juvenile or juvenile offender — Reimbursement for costs incurred.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20c05s20-524ol11">
       Whenever a juvenile or juvenile offender is placed by the court in custody other than that of his or her parents or custodian, after due notice to the parent or other persons legally obligated to care for and support the juvenile or juvenile offender, and after a hearing, the court may order and decree that the parent or other legally obligated person shall pay in such a manner as the court may direct a reasonable sum that will cover in whole or in part the support and treatment of the juvenile or juvenile offender. If the parent or other legally obligated person willfully fails or refuses to pay such sum, the court may proceed against him for contempt, or the order may be filed and shall have the effect of a civil judgment.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c05s20-524ol12">
       If the juvenile or juvenile offender is detained, the court may order that the parents of the juvenile or juvenile offender or other legally obligated person contribute to the costs of detention in an amount to be set by the court. The order may be filed and shall have the effect of a civil judgment. It is the intent of the legislature that foster parents or a parent or legal guardian receiving public assistance relating to that juvenile or juvenile offender should not benefit from the continued receipt of payments or public assistance from any state or federal agency while the juvenile or juvenile offender is detained. The department of health and welfare is directed to promulgate a rule implementing this intent.

        This section was amended by two 2012 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 19, added “or juvenile offender” at the end of the section heading; inserted “or juvenile offender” following “juvenile” throughout the section; and deleted former subsections (3) and (4), which read: “(3) All child support orders shall notify the obligor that the order will be enforced by income withholding pursuant to chapter 12, title 32, Idaho Code. (4) Failure to include these provisions does not affect the validity of the support order or decree. The court shall require that the social security numbers of both the obligor and obligee be included in the order or decree.”
    The 2012 amendment, by ch. 257, deleted “guardian” following “parent” or “parents” twice in subsection (1) and substituted “that the parents of the juvenile or other legally obligated person” for “parents or other legal guardian of the juvenile” in subsection (2).

        In order for the Idaho department of juvenile correction (IDJC) to create an actionable debt for reimbursement of its services: (1) IDJC must give notice to a juvenile’s parent of the parent’s obligation to pay; (2) IDJC must, after notice to the parent, initiate a court hearing to determine a reasonable sum the parent shall pay; and (3) a court must order and decree that the parent pay that sum. Action Collection Serv. v. Black, 163 Idaho 268, 411 P.3d 312 (Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a mother had notice of the Idaho department of juvenile correction’s (IDJC) claim to payment for support and treatment of her son while in IDJC custody, IDJC never initiated a hearing under this section and a court never ordered the mother to pay a reasonable sum. As a result, the IDJC never validly created a debt that could be collected under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c23s67-2358" target="_blank">§ 67-2358</a></cite>.

        Magistrate’s order that defendant juvenile’s mother reimburse county for the costs of defendant’s detention was reversed on appeal, because meaningful, constitutional notice was not provided to defendant’s mother. While it appeared that defendant’s mother had notice of her son’s disposition hearing, nothing in the record indicated that she had prior notice that detention costs could be imposed upon her at that hearing.

       <p>
        All orders or final judgments made by any court in matters affecting a juvenile offender within the purview of this act may be appealed by the juvenile offender or the state. A decision by the court pursuant to section 20-508, Idaho Code, not to waive jurisdiction under this act over the juvenile offender may be appealed by the state. Appeals shall be reviewed as provided by the appellate rules of the supreme court of Idaho, except no undertaking shall be required. Upon filing of the notice of appeal, the district court shall take jurisdiction of the case and if the juvenile offender is in detention shall promptly hold a hearing after the filing of a request to determine whether the juvenile offender shall remain in detention.

       <p>
        Although this section provides that “all orders” may be appealed, a youth subject to proceedings under the youth rehabilitation act [now juvenile corrections act] did not have the right to appeal from orders of the magistrate that he appear for hearings or that he meet with youth probation officers prior to the court’s entry of a decree disposing of the proceeding, for these orders did not affect any of the child’s substantial interests. In re Doe, 98 Idaho 40, 557 P.2d 634 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order waiving juvenile jurisdiction constitutes a final order of the magistrate’s division of the district court sitting as a juvenile court. State v. Harwood, 98 Idaho 793, 572 P.2d 1228 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a right to appeal under this section from an order granting motion to suppress evidence. State’s appeals are not limited to decisions not to waive jurisdiction. State v. Doe, 130 Idaho 811, 948 P.2d 166 (Ct. App. 1997).

       <p>
        Since this section requires an immediate appeal to a district court of a magistrate’s waiver of juvenile jurisdiction over a minor, and since there are no contrary precedents under the youth rehabilitation act (now juvenile corrections act) upon which a defendant could have relied in making his decision not to appeal the waiver in the district court, failure by the defendant to challenge the magistrate’s ruling in district court precluded consideration of that ruling in the supreme court. State v. Tipton, 99 Idaho 670, 587 P.2d 305 (1978).

        The magistrate’s order waiving its jurisdiction over a juvenile is a final order of the magistrate’s court and must be appealed to the district court prior to further proceedings in district court in the matter. State v. Tipton, 99 Idaho 670, 587 P.2d 305 (1978).

        Where magistrate’s order withholding judgment and placing youth on probation for a six months’ period was based upon the finding that the youth had committed the criminal offense of statutory rape, the order withholding judgment was appealable, even though it was not a final disposition of the matter.

       Juvenile offenders may be released to their own home, to a residential community-based program, to a nonresidential community-based treatment program, to an approved independent living setting, or to other appropriate residences, but shall remain on probation until the probation is terminated by the court. Following the release of a juvenile offender, the court may conduct a hearing to review the juvenile offender’s conditions of probation and determine whether existing conditions should be amended or eliminated or additional conditions imposed.

The juvenile offender may move for a hearing before the court to contest any conditions imposed by the probation officer. If the probation officer establishes additional conditions of probation, the probation officer shall advise the juvenile offender at the time such additional conditions are imposed of the juvenile offender’s right to move the court for a hearing to contest those conditions.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Violation by a juvenile offender of a curfew established by a municipal or county ordinance shall constitute an infraction and shall be punishable by a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150). Fines shall be deposited in the county juvenile justice fund of the county where the violation occurred, or if such a fund has not been established, then in the current county expense account for juvenile corrections purposes in the county where the violation occurred. Detention of a juvenile offender in a county jail or detention center for violation of a curfew is prohibited, unless the juvenile offender is an habitual status offender as defined in section 20-521, Idaho Code.

     <p>
      Any peace officer may issue a citation for violation of a curfew that shall thereafter proceed under the juvenile corrections act in the same manner as though the violation was charged by a petition. Citations shall be issued on the Idaho uniform citation form. The peace officer issuing a curfew citation may detain the violator and at the time the citation is issued shall make a reasonable effort to obtain the endorsement of the juvenile’s parent or legal guardian on the citation. If the endorsement of a parent or legal guardian cannot be obtained with the exercise of reasonable diligence, a copy of the citation shall be hand delivered or mailed to the juvenile’s parent or legal guardian by a peace officer at least seven (7) days prior to the date set for the juvenile’s appearance. The citation shall provide a date certain for the appearance before a magistrate of the juvenile and parent or legal guardian.

        Defendant failed to show that the alleged deprivation—confinement in state prison rather than county jail—caused the harm he claimed, namely, the disciplinary offense reports (DOR) on his prison record. It was possible for defendant to have remained in prison during 1990 without getting any DOR’s on his record. Brennan v. State, 122 Idaho 911, 841 P.2d 441 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Defendant was entitled to file for habeas corpus relief to remedy his apparently improper confinement in the state prison, in order to bring about his transfer to the correct institution, but he was not entitled to violate the prison rules without punishment.

        The board of corrections does not immediately lose “custody” over an inmate when the inmate’s conviction or sentence is vacated and his case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings. During the time between vacation and transfer of the prisoner to the custody of the county sheriff, the board of correction must necessarily retain jurisdiction and control over the inmate until that transfer is carried out. Brennan v. State, 122 Idaho 911, 841 P.2d 441 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an inmate’s transfer to another prison is not properly executed, but is unreasonably delayed or simply not carried out, the inmate’s remedy is to commence an administrative grievance procedure at the prison, or file a petition for habeas corpus relief.

     <p>
      The county wherein any court has entered an order pursuant to section 20-604, Idaho Code, shall pay all direct and indirect costs of the detention or confinement of the person to the governmental unit or agency owning or operating the jail or confinement facilities in which the person was confined or detained. The amount of such direct and indirect costs shall be determined on a per day per person basis by agreement between the county wherein the court entered the order and the county or governmental unit or agency owning or operating such jail or confinement facilities. In the absence of such agreement or order fixing the cost as provided in section 20-606, Idaho Code, the charge for each person confined or detained shall be the sum of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per day, plus the cost of any medical or dental services paid at the rate of reimbursement as provided in chapter 35, title 31, Idaho Code, unless a rate of reimbursement is otherwise established by contract or agreement; provided, however, that the county may determine whether the detained or confined person is eligible for any local, state, federal or private program that covers dental, medical and/or burial expenses. That person will be required to apply for those benefits, and any such benefits obtained may be applied to the detained or confined person’s incurred expenses, and in the event of the death of such detained or confined person, the county wherein the court entered the order shall pay all actual burial costs. Release from an order pursuant to section 20-604, Idaho Code, for the purpose of a person receiving medical treatment shall not relieve the county of its obligation of paying the medical care expenses imposed in this section. In case a person confined or detained was initially arrested by a city police officer for violation of the motor vehicle laws of this state or for violation of a city ordinance, the cost of such confinement or detention shall be a charge against such city by the county wherein the order of confinement was entered. All payments under this section shall be acted upon for each calendar month by the second Monday of the month following the date of billing.

        Counties are responsible for the cost incurred by the county jail in housing a prisoner who has been charged with a state law violation committed within city limits and investigated by city police officers and while counties may bring legal action to recoup jail cost incurred for city prisoners charged under city ordinances or state motor vehicle laws, sheriffs cannot refuse to accept city prisoners.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-4</cite>.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a district judge or magistrate orders the confinement or detention of any person under the preceding section 20-604, Idaho Code, in a jail or confinement facility in which there is no agreement as to the daily costs of confinement or detention, then any governmental unit or agency involved may apply by petition to the district court of the county in which such jail or confinement facility is located to determine the direct and indirect costs of confinement per person per day at the jail or facility. Such petition shall be filed with the district court and a copy thereof served upon the board of county commissioners or clerk thereof of the county or counties to be affected thereby, which county or counties shall be denominated as the respondent. Such respondent shall thereafter be allowed twenty (20) days to appear and plead to said petition. The determination of such costs shall be made by a district judge sitting without a jury in the same manner as other civil actions under all rules of procedure for district courts of the state of Idaho. Upon the final determination of the petition by trial or otherwise, the district court shall enter a decree binding upon all parties thereto for all persons then confined from said county or counties joined in the petition, stating the dollar amount of the confinement or detention costs per person per day which shall be paid by any such county confining or detaining persons in the jail or facility pursuant to a court order made under section 20-604, Idaho Code. Such decree shall have the force and effect of a final judgment, but the district court shall have continuing jurisdiction to vacate or modify such decree upon a material change of circumstances affecting such costs.
