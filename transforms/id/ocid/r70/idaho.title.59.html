        Section 50-209 indicates that the decision to appoint police officers is entirely discretionary with the municipality and, thus, although police officers are public officers whose duties relate to governmental functions of a municipality, a police officer does not fill an office created by the laws of the state of Idaho. Even though a city may require a police officer to take an oath. State v. Whelan, 103 Idaho 651, 651 P.2d 916 (1982).

      § 59-513. Deferred compensation programs for employees of state or political subdivisions.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state of Idaho, the state board of education for those employees eligible for participation in the optional retirement programs created in sections 33-107A and 33-107B, Idaho Code, and any county, city, or political subdivision of the state acting through its governing body, is hereby authorized to contract with an employee to defer all or a portion of that employee’s income, and may subsequently with the consent of the employee, invest such deferred income in a funding medium for the purpose of funding a deferred compensation program for the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state board of examiners shall supervise and regulate the deferred compensation program for state employees, and may adopt rules to implement such a program; provided however, that the state board of education shall supervise and regulate any deferred compensation program it establishes and may adopt rules to implement such a program.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing body of any county, city, or political subdivision of the state, shall supervise and regulate the deferred compensation program for its employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      In no event shall the amount of income an employee elects to defer exceed the total annual salary, or compensation under the existing salary schedule or classification plan applicable to such employee in such year. Any income deferred under such a plan shall continue to be included as regular compensation for the purpose of computing the retirement contributions and pension benefits earned by any employee, but any sum so deferred shall not be included in the computation of any income taxes withheld on behalf of any such employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coverage of an employee under a deferred compensation plan under this section shall not render such employee ineligible for simultaneous membership and participation in the pension systems for public employees which are otherwise provided for.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this section the state controller is authorized to make such deductions from salary for any employee of the state who has authorized such deductions in writing, and the state board of examiners may designate administrative agents for the state of Idaho to execute all necessary agreements pertaining to the deferred compensation program.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this section, the term “employee” includes elected or appointed officials.

        Section 241 of S.L. 1994, ch. 180 provided that such act should become effective on and after the first Monday in January, 1995 [January 2, 1995] if the amendment to the Constitution of Idaho changing the name of the state auditor to state controller [1994 S.J.R. No. 109, p. 1493] was adopted at the general election held on November 8, 1994. Since such amendment was adopted, the amendment to this section by § 131 of S.L. 1994, ch. 180 became effective January 2, 1995.

       <p>
        Section 2 of S.L. 2003, ch. 305 provides: “This act shall be in full force and effect on and after January 1, 2006, or upon the termination or expiration of the existing restated and amended deferred compensation plan administration agreement implementing the provisions of section 59-513, Idaho Code, whichever occurs first. Provided however, that the State Board of Education may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this act on and after July 1, 2003, so long as such rules do not permit the implementation to occur prior to the effective date of this act.” The deferred compensation agreement implementing this section did not terminate or expire prior to January 1, 2006. Thus, pursuant to S.L. 2003, ch. 305, § 2, the 2003 amendment of this section took effect on January 1, 2006.

        When the penal sum of any bond required to be given amounts to more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), the sureties may become severally liable for portions of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) thereof, making in the aggregate at least two (2) sureties for the whole penal sum; and if any such bond becomes forfeited, an action may be brought thereon against all or any number of the obligors, and judgment entered against them, either jointly or severally, as they may be liable. The judgment must not be entered against a surety severally bonded for a greater sum than that for which he is specially liable by the terms of the bond.

      <li id="t59c09s59-906ol11">
       Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, all vacancies in any county office of any of the several counties of the state, except that of the county commissioners (who shall be appointed by the governor), shall be filled by appointment by the county commissioners of the county in which the vacancy occurs in accordance with the procedure prescribed below until the next general election, when such vacancy shall be filled by election.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c09s59-906ol12">
       When a county elected officer, except a county commissioner, gives a written notice of intent to resign to the board of commissioners of the county of which he is an elected officer, and when the notice of intent to resign specifies the effective date of the resignation, the county central committee of the same political party of the officer whose office is being vacated, may submit a list of three (3) nominations to the board of county commissioners prior to the effective date of the resignation. The board of county commissioners shall fill the vacancy by appointment from the submitted list to be effective on the day following the date the office is vacated by the former officer. The person selected shall be a person who possesses the same qualifications at the time of his appointment as those provided by law for election to the office. In the event the county elected officer rescinds his notice of intent to resign by notifying the board of county commissioners in writing prior to the effective date of his resignation, all actions taken by either the county central committee or the board of county commissioners to fill the anticipated vacancy, shall be null and void. If no appointment is made prior to the day the office is vacated, the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall apply.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The vacancy shall be filled as follows: the county central committee of the same political party, if any, of the former officer, whose office is vacant, shall submit a list of three (3) nominations to the board of county commissioners within fifteen (15) days from the day the office is vacated. The board of county commissioners shall fill the vacancy by appointment from the submitted list within fifteen (15) days. Should no appointment be made within fifteen (15) days, the county central committee of the political party submitting the nominations shall designate one (1) of the three (3) nominees to fill the vacancy. The person selected shall be a person who possesses the same qualifications at the time of his appointment as those provided by law for election to the office. Upon failure of the committee to make a selection before the expiration of the additional fifteen (15) day period, the board of county commissioners shall, within five (5) days, fill the vacancy by appointing a person having the same qualifications at the time of his appointment as those provided by law for election to the office. If the person who has vacated the office has not been affiliated with a political party, the vacancy shall be filled by the board of county commissioners by appointment of a person having the same qualifications at the time of his appointment as those provided by law for election to the office.

     <p>
      Whenever for any reason any elective official of the state, is temporarily unable to perform the duties of his office, the governor may appoint a suitable person to perform such duties temporarily as an acting officer, until the incumbent of the office shall be able to resume the performance of his duties, or a vacancy occurs in such office. The governor shall require such bonds for persons so appointed as may appear to him necessary for the protection of the state, not exceeding the bonds given by the officer in whose stead he acts. Such acting officer shall be nominated by the incumbent of the office: provided, that when the incumbent is unable or fails to so nominate, the governor may appoint without such nomination: provided further, that nothing in this section contained shall be construed to amend or repeal existing laws relating to filling vacancies in state offices. In any case involving an office, the appointment to which, at the time involved would, in case of vacancy, require the consent of the senate, the consent of the senate shall be requisite to the temporary service of the acting officer.

      The design drawn and executed by Miss Emma Edwards, of Boise City, and reported and recommended by the select joint committee to devise a great seal for the state, with the Latin motto “Esto Perpetua,” is adopted, and is hereby made the great seal of the state of Idaho. The painting shall serve as the model as to color and form for the center of the seal. The five-pointed star in the painting shall be within a border encircling the painting. Within the border shall be the words: Great Seal of the state of Idaho. The secretary of state, with the approval of the state board of examiners, shall have designed the appropriate encircling border and wording as herein set forth and shall have the same superimposed on a fully colored reproduction of the painting. This, when completed, shall be designated as the “Official Copy” of the great seal of the state of Idaho and shall be maintained in the office of the secretary of state.

      § 59-1005A. Authorship and description of great seal of state. — The inscription of authorship of the great seal of state shall appear as follows: 1891 EMMA EDWARDS GREEN
     </h3>
     <p>
      PAUL B. EVANS rev. 1957. The new inscription shall be located in the same place and manner as the previous inscription, using more space as is necessary. In gratitude for and as a tribute to Emma Edwards Green for her design of the Idaho state seal is her description of the seal in her own words:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Before designing the seal, I was careful to make a thorough study of the resources and future possibilities of the state. I invited the advice and counsel of every member of the legislature and other citizens qualified to help in creating a seal of state that really represented Idaho at that time. Idaho had been admitted into the Union on July 3rd, 1890, and on March 14, 1891, adopted my design for the great seal of the state of Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      The question of woman suffrage was being agitated somewhat, and as leading men and politicians agreed that Idaho would eventually give women the right to vote, and as mining was the chief industry, and the mining man the largest financial factor at that time, I made the figure of the man the most prominent in the design, while that of the woman, signifying justice, as noted by the scales; liberty, as noted by the liberty cap on the end of the spear, and equality with man as denoted by her positions at his side, also signifies freedom. The pick and shovel held by the miner, and the ledge of rock beside which he stands, as well as the pieces of ore scattered about his feet, all indicate the chief occupation of the state. The stamp mill in the distance, which you can see by using a magnifying glass, is also typical of the mining interest of Idaho. The shield between the man and woman is emblematic of the protection they unite in giving the state. The large fir or pine tree in the foreground in the shield refers to Idaho’s immense timber interests. The husbandman plowing on the left side of the shield, together with the sheaf of grain beneath the shield, are emblematic of Idaho’s agricultural resources, while the cornucopias, or horns of plenty, refer to the horticultural. Idaho has a game law, which protects the elk and moose. The elk’s head, therefore, rises above the shield. The state flower, the wild Syringa or Mock Orange, grows at the woman’s feet, while the ripened wheat grows as high as her shoulder. The star signifies a new light in the galaxy of states. ... The river depicted in the shield is our mighty Snake or Shoshone River, a stream of great majesty.
     </p>
     <p>
      In regard to the coloring of the emblems used in the making of the great seal of the state of Idaho, my principal desire was to use such colors as would typify pure Americanism and the history of the state. As Idaho was a virgin state, I robed my goddess in white and made the liberty cap on the end of the spear the same color. In representing the miner, I gave him the garb of the period suggested by such mining authorities as former United States Senator George Shoup, of Idaho, former Governor Norman B. Willey of Idaho, former Governor James H. Hawley of Idaho, and other mining men and early residents of the state who knew intimately the usual garb of the miner. Almost unanimously they said, “Do not put the miner in a red shirt.” “Make the shirt a grayish brown,” said Captain J.J. Wells, chairman of the seal committee. The “Light of the Mountains” is typified by the rosy glow which precedes the sunrise.”

The amount of any recoveries on behalf of the state and its agencies and school districts after deducting the expenses of collection shall be transferred to the state general account. Any expenses previously paid by a state agency shall be refunded to such state agency from such recoveries. Any unpaid expenses shall be paid from such recoveries. The amount of any recoveries on behalf of other governmental entities after deducting any unpaid expenses of collection shall be refunded to such governmental entities or allowed as a credit against future social security liability.

      <li id="t59c13s59-1301ol11">
       A retirement and disability benefit system is created and placed under the management of a retirement board for the purpose of providing a retirement system and other benefits for public employees in the state of Idaho under this chapter. The retirement system shall be known as the “Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho.”
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1301ol12">
       The purpose of such system is to provide an orderly means whereby public employees in the state of Idaho who become superannuated or otherwise incapacitated as the result of age or disability, may be retired from active service without prejudice and without inflicting a hardship upon the employees retired, and to enable such employees to accumulate pension credits to provide for old-age, disability, death and termination of employment, thus effecting economy and efficiency in the administration of the state, county and local government. The legislature, therefore, declares that, in its considered judgment, the public good, and the general welfare of the citizens of this state required the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the state.

       Should legislation be adopted permitting a public subdivision to voluntary withdrawal from PERSI (Public Employees Retirement System of Idaho), PERSI while not having a fiduciary duty to challenge the legislation, would be charged with the responsibility of allowing political subdivisions to withdraw from the system and would, thus, have standing to bring a declaratory judgment action or to bring an original action in the supreme court seeking a judicial declaration of the validity of the statute before allowing any withdrawals; thus, by obtaining such a declaration prior to actually allowing employers to withdraw, PERSI could avoid the logistical problems that could be created if the statute were declared invalid after a number of employers had already withdrawn and employees brought an action seeking damages for PERSI’s breach of its fiduciary duty regarding employee’s benefits.<cite class="OAG">OAG 96-1</cite>.

        Where the public employees were not actually engaged in “hazardous law enforcement duties” despite being given that classification, the legislature had the authority to classify them as general members rather than police officer members and, prospectively, reduce the rate at which they earned retirement benefits.

       Cafeteria plan benefits are included within “salary” as defined by subsection (31) of this section only to the extent an employee has a right to elect to receive cash benefits pursuant to the cafeteria plan; accordingly, an employee’s “salary” for retirement purposes, as well as the employee’s retirement benefits and contributions, will be the same whether the employee elects to receive cash or elects to receive alternative benefits with a corresponding reduction in cash received.<cite class="OAG">OAG 86-12</cite>.

       As nonprofit corporations, the association of Idaho cities and Idaho association of counties are private entities.

       Should legislation be adopted permitting a public subdivision to voluntary withdrawal from PERSI (Public Employees Retirement System of Idaho), PERSI, while not having a fiduciary duty to challenge the legislation, would be charged with the responsibility of allowing political subdivisions to withdraw from the system and would, thus, have standing to bring a declaratory judgment action or to bring an original action in the supreme court seeking a judicial declaration of the validity of the statute before allowing any withdrawals; thus, by obtaining such a declaration prior to actually allowing employers to withdraw, PERSI could avoid the logistical problems that could be created if the statute were declared invalid after a number of employers had already withdrawn and employees brought an action seeking damages for PERSI’s breach of its fiduciary duty regarding employee’s benefits.<cite class="OAG">OAG 96-1</cite>.

        Where the public employees were not actually engaged in “hazardous law enforcement duties” despite being given that classification, the legislature had the authority to classify them as general members rather than police officer members and prospectively reduce the rate at which they earned retirement benefits.

        An employee currently occupying a police officer member position with Rule of 80 status, whose position is reclassified to that of a general member, which does not give rise to Rule of 80 status, retains the retirement benefits that he or she has already accrued. As long as the employee remains in that same position, he or she will continue to be deemed to be a police officer member and retain Rule of 80 status for retirement purposes. If the employee moves to a different position, he or she will no longer be deemed to be a police officer member and will lose Rule of 80 status for purposes of accruing future benefits.<cite class="OAG">OAG 2017-1</cite>.

       The board shall have the power and duty, subject to the limitations of this chapter, of managing the system. It shall have the powers and privileges of a corporation, including the right to sue and be sued in its own name as such board. Members of the retirement board, retirement system staff and retirement system mortgage and investment committee members shall, jointly and individually, be provided a defense and indemnified against all claims, demands, judgments, costs, charges and expenses, including court costs and attorney’s fees, and against all liability losses and damages of any nature whatsoever that arise out of and in the course and scope of their official duties and functions, but only if the defense and indemnity for such person’s wrongful act or omission are not provided by chapter 9, title 6, Idaho Code, and the wrongful act or omission of the person was not intentional, willful or wanton misconduct, fraudulent, or a knowing violation of law. The board may, as a fiduciary of the trust, determine to provide a defense and indemnity hereunder. The board may, as a fiduciary of the trust, determine to refuse a defense, or disavow and refuse to pay any judgment against a board member, retirement system staff, or retirement system mortgage and investment committee member if it is determined that such person was not within the course and scope of his official duties and functions or his conduct was intentional misconduct, willful, wanton, fraudulent, or a knowing violation of the law. Any defense and indemnity provided under this section shall be an expense of the trust, and the board is authorized but not required to purchase insurance to protect against such risks notwithstanding any other provision of law. No contribution or indemnification, or reimbursement for legal fees and expenses related to such defense or indemnification, shall be sought from any person defended or indemnified under this section unless the court in which the underlying claim was brought finds that the act or omission of the person was outside the course and scope of his official duties and functions or was intentional, willful or wanton misconduct, fraudulent, or a knowing violation of law. Any action by the trust against a board member, retirement system staff, or mortgage and investment committee member, and any action by a person against the trust for contribution, indemnification or necessary legal fees and expenses shall be tried to the court in the same civil lawsuit brought on the claim against the retirement board member, retirement system staff, or retirement system mortgage and investment committee member. The venue of all actions in which the board is a party shall be Ada county, Idaho.

      <li id="t59c13s59-1305ol13">
       The board shall authorize the creation of whatever staff it deems necessary for sound and economical administration of the system. The executive director shall hire the persons for the staff who shall hold their respective positions subject to the rules of a merit system for state employees. The salaries and compensation of all persons employed for purposes of administering the system shall be fixed by the board and as otherwise provided by law.

       The board shall obtain all actuarial, audit, legal and medical services it deems appropriate for the system. It shall cause a competent actuary who is a member of the academy of actuaries and who is familiar with public systems of pensions to be retained on a consulting basis. The actuary shall be the technical advisor of the board on matters regarding the operation of the system. During the first year of operation of the system and at least once every four (4) years thereafter, the actuary shall make a general investigation of the suitability of the actuarial tables used by the system. The board shall adopt the actuarial tables and assumptions in use by the system and may change the same in its sole discretion at any time. The actuary shall make an annual valuation of the liabilities and reserves of the system, and an annual determination of the amount of contributions required from the employers under this chapter, and certify the results thereof to the board. The actuary shall also perform such other duties as may be assigned by the board. An independent financial audit shall be conducted annually or as frequently as otherwise determined by the board.

       If the board determines that it has previously overpaid or underpaid benefits provided under this chapter or chapter 14, title 72, Idaho Code, it shall correct the prior error. In the event of prior underpayment, the board shall forthwith pay the amount of the underpayment together with regular interest thereon. In the event of prior overpayment, the board may offset future benefit payments by the amount of the prior overpayment together with regular interest thereon. Any such decision to offset future benefit payments shall be administratively and judicially reviewable as provided in section 59-1314, Idaho Code. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the rights of a member or the board to pursue any other remedy provided by law.

       Should legislation be adopted permitting a public subdivision to voluntary withdrawal from PERSI (Public Employees Retirement System of Idaho), PERSI, while not having a fiduciary duty to challenge the legislation, would be charged with the responsibility of allowing political subdivisions to withdraw from the system and would, thus, have standing to bring a declaratory judgment action or to bring an original action in the supreme court seeking a judicial declaration of the validity of the statute before allowing any withdrawals; thus by obtaining such a declaration prior to actually allowing employers to withdraw, PERSI could avoid the logistical problems that could be created if the statute were declared invalid after a number of employers had already withdrawn and employees brought an action seeking damages for PERSI’s breach of its fiduciary duty regarding employee’s benefits.<cite class="OAG">OAG 96-1</cite>.

      § 59-1308. Supplemental benefit plan — Contributions and expenses of the supplemental benefit plan — Indemnification.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol11">
       The state shall sponsor and the board shall administer one (1) or more supplemental benefit plans to be used for allocation of extraordinary gains as provided in section 59-1309, Idaho Code, and for voluntary contributions of active members. The supplemental plans may be established under the qualified requirements of section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Service Code and with the qualified cash or deferred arrangements under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Service Code or any other tax-deferred plan permitted by law, as determined by the retirement board. The board is authorized to secure such qualified staff and consultants as it determines necessary to establish and administer such plans. Employee and employer contributions shall be permitted according to the provisions of these plans as established by the board. For purposes of this section “employee” shall mean a participant as defined in the supplemental benefit plan documents or board rules.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol12">
       The board is authorized, but not required, to establish separate trust funds to hold the assets of the supplemental benefit plans created under this section. The investment options available under supplemental benefit plans shall be determined by the board, and may include, but are not limited to, investment in all or part of the public employee retirement fund and use of private vendor options.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol13">
       Supplemental benefit plans shall be available to all active members and shall be in addition to any other retirement or tax-deferred compensation system established by the employer. The board may provide educational opportunities related to supplemental benefit plans and retirement savings, as determined by the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol14">
       Accounts shall be established in supplemental benefit plans for all active members eligible for an extraordinary gains transfer under section 59-1309, Idaho Code. After the initial transfer of extraordinary gains, any active member may make additional voluntary contributions to his/her account, subject to applicable limitations, by authorizing his/her employer to contribute an amount by payroll deduction to the supplemental benefit plan in lieu of receiving such amount as salary. The amount of such contributions shall be subject to any limitations established by the board, state or federal law. The employer shall provide coordination of contributions between multiple plans to assure that contribution limits are not exceeded. Should aggregate contributions to multiple plans exceed applicable limits, excess contributions shall be deemed to apply exclusively to plans not created by this chapter. In the event a preexisting plan is used as a supplemental plan, voluntary contributions may continue to be made to that plan despite the absence of extraordinary gains transfers.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol15">
       For purposes of this section the employer is authorized to make such deductions from salary for any employee who has authorized such deductions in writing. The employer shall forward all contributions under this section to the board by the fifth working day after each payroll, in addition to reports as directed by the board. Any costs incurred by the board, whether direct or indirect, due to an employer’s failure to properly withhold, transfer, limit and report contributions, shall be the responsibility of the employer and shall be immediately due and payable upon notice from the board. This includes, but is not limited to, costs associated with plan corrections. Such costs shall be treated as delinquent contributions under section 59-1325, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol16">
       The board may enter into agreements with employers or require participation to implement the supplemental benefit plans and the board may designate administrative agents to execute all necessary agreements pertaining to the supplemental benefit plans.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol17">
       All contributions received from participants in the supplemental benefit plans shall be deposited with a trustee designated by the board. All such funds are hereby perpetually appropriated to the board, shall not be included in the department’s budget, and may be invested or used to pay for investment and administrative expenses of the supplemental benefit plans. Inactive members may be required to transfer supplemental benefit plan account balances as determined by the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol18">
       The board may establish rules to implement and administer supplemental benefit plans. Costs of administration shall be appropriated by the legislature and may be paid from the interest earnings of the funds accrued as a result of the deposits or as an assessment against each account, to be decided by the board. Investment related expenses are exempt from appropriation.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol19">
       Contributions and investment earnings under the supplemental benefit plans shall be exempt from federal and state income taxes until the ultimate distribution of such contributions. Distributions of funds held in supplemental benefit plan accounts are subject to federal law limitations. The board may provide for retirement disbursement options other than lump sum payments.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol110">
       All additional contributions made by the employee under this section shall continue to be included as regular compensation for the purpose of computing the employer and employee retirement contributions and pension benefits earned by an employee under this chapter, but such sum shall not be included in the computation of any income taxes withheld on behalf of any employee. However, funds accrued in a supplemental benefit plan account shall not be considered in determining any other benefits under this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol111">
       The provisions of sections 59-1316 and 59-1317(1), (2) and (5), Idaho Code, shall also apply to the supplemental benefit plans created under this section. Should a court order that an assignment be made to a participant’s spouse or former spouse of all or part of an account created under this section, the assignment shall be separate and distinct from any approved domestic retirement order required by section 59-1317(4), Idaho Code. Requirements for assignments of supplemental accounts may be set forth in rule or other plan documents.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1308ol112">
       Members of the retirement board or retirement system staff shall, jointly or individually, be provided a defense and indemnified against all claims, demands, judgments, costs, charges and expenses, including court costs and attorney’s fees, and against all liability losses and damages of any nature whatsoever arising out of and in the course and scope of their official duties and functions in administering any plans created pursuant to the provisions of this section to the same extent as provided in section 59-1305(1), Idaho Code. The venue of all actions in which the retirement board or retirement staff is a party shall be in Ada county, Idaho.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1309ol11">
       At the close of each fiscal year, the board shall determine whether the fund has experienced extraordinary gains. If extraordinary gains exist the board may allocate all or part of them as set forth in this section. In determining whether extraordinary gains should be allocated, the board shall exercise its fiduciary discretion.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1309ol12">
       Extraordinary gains are defined as the excess, if any, at the close of the fiscal year of plan assets over the plan’s accrued actuarially determined liabilities plus a sum necessary to absorb a one (1) standard deviation market event without increasing contribution rates, as determined by the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1309ol13">
       If the board determines that extraordinary gains should be allocated, the gains shall be allocated to retirees, to active members, and to employers in such proportion as determined by the board. The board shall determine no later than the first day of December following the close of the fiscal year the amount of extraordinary gains to be allocated, if any.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1309ol14">
       Retirees shall receive their allocation in the form of a one-time payment made in addition to their regular monthly benefit payments. For purposes of this section, “retirees” include retired members, members receiving a disability retirement allowance, contingent annuitants, and surviving spouses who elected the annuity option under section 59-1361(5), Idaho Code. To participate in the retiree allocation, a retiree must be receiving a regular monthly allowance at the close of the fiscal year and on the date of distribution. The retiree allocation shall be distributed proportionally based on the final monthly retirement allowance of the fiscal year divided by the total of all monthly retirement allowances paid for the same month. The date of distribution shall be no later than the first day of February following the close of the fiscal year.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1309ol15">
       Active members shall receive their allocation as a transfer of funds to a supplemental retirement account established by the board. Funds transferred to or held in supplemental retirement accounts shall be accounted for separately and shall not be considered in determining any other benefits under this chapter. To participate in the active member allocation, the member must have been an active member on the last day of the fiscal year and have accrued at least twelve (12) months of service on that date. Any member who has withdrawn contributions from the fund prior to the date of transfer is not eligible to receive a transfer under this section. The active member allocation shall be distributed proportionally based on accumulated contributions at the close of the fiscal year divided by the total accumulated contributions of all active members at the close of the fiscal year, not to exceed the amount that would result by applying the limits imposed by rule or by section 415(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code to compensation earned during the fiscal year. The transfer of funds shall occur in the following calendar year but shall be subject to reduction and forfeiture, based on the application of limits imposed by rule or by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code for that year.

    (6) Employers shall receive their allocation as a credit against future contributions required by section 59-1325, Idaho Code. Credits are not available to any employer who has withdrawn from participation in the fund prior to the transfer date. The employer allocation shall be credited proportionally based on employer contribution liability accrued during the fiscal year as provided in section 59-1322, Idaho Code, divided by the total employer contribution liability for the fiscal year. The credits shall be established no later than the first day of February following the close of the fiscal year. The credits shall be applied thereafter in the same manner as provided in section 59-1325, Idaho Code, until exhausted. If, after twelve (12) months of remittances, an employer’s credits have not been exhausted, and the employer has not withdrawn from participation in the fund, the value of the remaining credits shall carry over to the next year, together with an interest payment equal to regular interest on the remaining credits.

        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 19, deleted the former last sentence of subsection (7) which read: “Furthermore, upon the death of the alternate payee, his/her percentage of the benefit will revert to the person or persons, including the member, who are entitled to the benefit under the system at the time of the alternate payee’s death”; added the last sentence of subsection (8); and rewrote subsection (9) which formerly read: “For benefits defined under chapter 14, title 72, Idaho Code, the benefit paid to the alternate payee shall start when the retirement system begins paying benefits to the member, surviving spouse, or surviving children. Unless otherwise ordered, in the event the member dies and leaves a surviving spouse, during the surviving spouse’s lifetime, the alternate payee shall be paid his/her designated amount or percentage of the benefit. Unless otherwise ordered, if there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse dies and there is a surviving child or children of the member who are under eighteen (18) years of age and unmarried, then the alternate payee shall be paid his/her designated amount or percentage of the benefit until the child or children reach the age of eighteen (18) years or marries, whichever occurs first.” Compiler’s Notes.

      § 59-1321. Procedure for employees of political subdivisions to be included in retirement system.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A political subdivision not participating in the system may, through its governing body, notify the board in writing that it elects to include its employees in the system. The board shall make a study and estimate the cost of including such employees in the system. Upon completion of the study and under the condition that the excess cost, if any, to include the employees as active members is paid upon admission, the political subdivision may apply for admission to the system. Payment of excess cost shall be made upon admission, unless the board in its sole discretion grants an extension. In no case shall an extension exceed two (2) years. Thereupon the board may upon such terms, not inconsistent with this chapter, as are set forth in a contract between the board and the political subdivision, integrate said political subdivision, and its employees into the system established by this chapter effective on the date of notice of election or later unless otherwise prohibited by law. The contract shall have no effect, however, until notice and hearing regarding it is afforded to such employees. Such contract shall provide for the appropriate funding of accrued benefits under any existing retirement program at the time the political subdivision is admitted to the system.

      <li id="t59c13s59-1325ol11">
       Each employer, or, where the employer’s payroll is paid separately by departments, each department of the employer, shall remit to the retirement board all contributions required of it and its employees on the basis of salaries paid by it during each pay period together with whatever contributions or contribution credits may be required to correct previous errors or omissions. These remittances shall be accompanied by such reports as are required by the board to determine contributions required and member benefit entitlements established under this chapter and, unless extended in writing by the executive director, shall be remitted no later than five (5) days after each pay date. Such contributions shall be remitted together with contributions remitted pursuant to subsection (5) of section 59-1308, Idaho Code, as directed by the board. Thereafter, unpaid contributions shall be considered delinquent and interest will begin accruing at the greater of the rate of interest provided in section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code, or regular interest. The executive director may, in his discretion, waive these interest charges in extraordinary circumstances.

       If any employer shall fail or refuse to remit any such contributions within thirty (30) days after the date due, the board may certify to the state controller the fact of such failure or refusal and the amount of the delinquent contribution or contributions, together with interest.

      § 59-1326. Procedure for complete or partial withdrawal of political subdivisions from the system — Calculation of withdrawal liability — Indemnification.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1326ol11">
       A political subdivision, through its governing body, may by resolution adopted by two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the governing body, declare its intent to withdraw completely from the system and to submit the question of withdrawing from the system to the active members of the political subdivision. The political subdivision shall notify its employees and the retirement board, in writing, of its action, and shall advise the active members of their right to vote for or against withdrawal, as provided in subsection (2) of this section. A political subdivision shall automatically be considered to have requested a complete withdrawal from the system the date the political subdivision permanently ceases to employ active members. A withdrawing political subdivision shall be required to make withdrawal liability payments as provided in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1326ol12">
       All active members of the withdrawing political subdivision shall be allowed to vote by secret ballot for or against allowing the political subdivision to completely withdraw from the system. More than fifty percent (50%) of the withdrawing political subdivision’s active members must approve the complete withdrawal at least thirty (30) days before the effective withdrawal date. All active members of the withdrawing political subdivision who are on the political subdivision’s payroll thirty (30) days before the effective withdrawal date shall be allowed to vote. If more than fifty percent (50%) of the withdrawing political subdivision’s active members fail to vote for complete withdrawal, the political subdivision shall not be allowed to withdraw. Fifteen (15) days before the effective withdrawal date the governing board of the withdrawing political subdivision shall certify to the retirement board the results of the voting by the active members.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1326ol13">
       Partial withdrawal occurs for a political subdivision when its average membership declines from one fiscal year to the next by more than twenty-five (25) members and twenty-five percent (25%) of the average membership in the earlier year. The effective date of partial withdrawal is the first day after the end of the later year.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1326ol14">
       Complete withdrawal by a political subdivision shall be the first day of the month following the date the political subdivision ceases to employ active members or the first day of the month following sixty (60) days from the date the board receives the political subdivision’s written request to withdraw. However, the complete withdrawal date shall not occur before the withdrawal liability is determined, as provided in subsection (7) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1326ol15">
       After complete withdrawal, all employees of the withdrawing political subdivision shall be ineligible to accrue future benefits with the system due to employment with the withdrawing political subdivision. The withdrawing political subdivision shall be ineligible to request to be included in the system, as provided in section 59-1321, Idaho Code, for five (5) years after its complete withdrawal date.
    (6) All active or inactive members of the political subdivision shall be eligible for benefits accrued with the system up to the complete withdrawal date. However, no retirement allowance or separation benefit shall be paid until the member actually separates from service with the withdrawing political subdivision, and there is no guarantee of right to re-employment made by the withdrawing political subdivision. If the person returns to employment with the same withdrawing political subdivision within ninety (90) days, any separation benefit or retirement allowance paid to the person shall be repaid to the system.

      “Average membership” for a fiscal year shall equal one-twelfth (1/12) of the sum of the number of active members employed during each month of that year.

      (7) On the date of complete withdrawal, the withdrawal liability of an employer is (a) multiplied by the ratio of (b) to (c) as follows:

     <p>
      The actuarial costs to determine the amount described in subsection (7) (b) of this section shall be paid by the withdrawing political subdivision.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) On the date of partial withdrawal, the withdrawal liability of an employer is the same as if complete withdrawal had occurred, multiplied by one (1) minus the ratio of (a) to (b) as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) The average membership of the employer estimated by the board for the year commencing on such date;
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) The average membership of the employer during the second complete fiscal year prior to such date.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) The withdrawing political subdivision shall enter into a contract with the system which establishes terms for the political subdivision’s payment of its withdrawal liability. The contract shall use an interest rate equal to the interest rate used in the actuarial valuation adopted by the board prior to the withdrawal date, net of actuarially assumed investment expenses. The contract shall not extend the duration of the withdrawal liability payments beyond ten (10) years or the end of the current amortization period whichever is less. The contract shall be a financial obligation of the withdrawing political subdivision and any of its successors and assigns. “Current amortization period” means the period over which the amortization payment rate times the actuarial present value of the projected salaries is equivalent to the unfunded actuarial liability, all determined by the current valuation last adopted by the board prior to the complete withdrawal date.

Any litigation regarding the forfeiture of any benefits because of the political subdivision’s complete withdrawal from the system shall be the sole legal responsibility of the withdrawing political subdivision and the withdrawing political subdivision shall indemnify and hold harmless the system, its board, its employees and the state of Idaho, from any claims, losses, costs, damages, expenses, and liabilities, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, asserted by any person or entity as a result of the political subdivision’s withdrawal from the system.

Otherwise, such percentage shall be one hundred percent (100%) reduced by one-fourth of one percent (.25%) for each month up to sixty (60) months that the member’s retirement precedes the date the member would be eligible to receive full accrued benefit without additional credited service, and further reduced by two-thirds of one percent (.6667%) for each additional month. Effective October 1, 1992, the further reduction for each additional month shall equal six thousand forty-two ten-thousandths of one percent (.6042%) of the member’s average monthly salary; effective October 1, 1993, the further reduction for each additional month shall equal five thousand four hundred seventeen ten-thousandths of one percent (.5417%) of the member’s average monthly salary; and effective October 1, 1994, the further reduction for each additional month shall equal four thousand seven hundred ninety-two ten-thousandths of one percent (.4792%) of the member’s average monthly salary. Entitlement to an annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall not vest until the effective date of that annual amount of accrued retirement allowance.

       Each retirement allowance payment shall, subject to the provisions of this section, equal the inflation factor for the adjustment year of payment multiplied by the amount of the retirement allowance payment for March of the previous year. During any adjustment year for which the ratio of the consumer price index for the index month of the previous year to the consumer price index for the index month of the second previous year is not more than one hundred one percent (101%), the inflation factor shall be such ratio or ninety-four percent (94%), whichever is greater, which inflation factor shall not be subject to legislative approval. Otherwise the inflation factor during such adjustment year shall be one hundred one percent (101%), except that the board, with legislative approval, may put into effect a greater factor which is no more than such ratio or one hundred six percent (106%), whichever is smaller, if it finds the value of the actuarial assets of the system to be no less than its actuarial liabilities, including those created by the increased factor. The actuarial assets comprise the sum of the actuarial present value of the amortization payments determined in accordance with the requirements of section 59-1322(5), Idaho Code, plus the amounts determined in paragraphs (e)(ii), (e)(iii), (e)(iv), (e)(v) and (g) of section 59-1322(4), Idaho Code. The actuarial liabilities are as defined in paragraph (e)(i) of section 59-1322(4), Idaho Code. The board’s proposed inflation factor for any adjustment year shall be communicated by letter to the legislature by not later than January 15 prior to that year.

       During an adjustment year following one in which there was at least one (1) retirement allowance payment but none in March, each retirement allowance payment shall equal the partial factor multiplied by the amount of the monthly retirement allowance payment in the earlier year. The partial factor shall equal 1.000 plus one-twelfth (1/12) of the product of the number of months in the earlier adjustment year in which member contributions were not made and the excess, if any, of the inflation factor for the later year over 1.000.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c13s59-1355ol13">
       During an adjustment year following one in which there was no retirement allowance payment, each retirement allowance payment shall equal the initial retirement allowance multiplied by the bridging factor between the first day of the month following the member’s final contribution and the date of the first retirement allowance payment.

        <li id="t59c13s59-1355ol13a">
         Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the bridging factor between any two (2) dates shall be the ratio of the amounts of retirement allowance payable on the two (2) dates for any member who retired on the earlier date immediately following his final contribution.

         For any member not making a final contribution subsequent to 1974 whose initial retirement allowance is a minimum allowance provided in section 59-1342(1)(b) or 59-1342(2)(b), Idaho Code, the bridging factor shall be computed as if the member had made his final contribution in 1974.
    (4) The consumer price index shall be that for all urban consumers published by the bureau of labor statistics, United States department of labor.

      (6) An adjustment year shall extend from March through the following February. The index month is October for adjustment years commencing before March, 1990, and is August for subsequent adjustment years.

      (7) If, by the forty-fifth day of any regular legislative session, the legislature has not adopted a concurrent resolution rejecting or amending the proposed adjustments of the board allowed in subsections (1) and (8) of this section, such action on the part of the legislature shall constitute legislative approval of the board’s adjustments.

       If an early retired member is reemployed with the same employer within ninety (90) days from retiring, or the early retired member is guaranteed reemployment with the same employer, the member shall be considered to have continued in the status of an employee and not to have separated from service. Any retirement allowance payments received by the retired member shall be repaid to the system and the retirement shall be negated. The month of last contribution prior to the negated retirement and the month of initial contribution upon return to reemployment shall be considered consecutive months of contributions in the determination of an appropriate salary base period upon subsequent retirement. A retired member is not considered to have separated from service if he continues performing services for the same employer in any capacity including, but not limited to, independent contractor, leased employee, or temporary services.

The suspended benefit, as adjusted pursuant to section 59-1355, Idaho Code, shall resume upon subsequent retirement, along with a separate allowance computed with respect to only that salary and service credited during the period of reemployment. Any death benefit that becomes payable under the suspended benefit shall be payable under section 59-1361(2), Idaho Code. Any death benefit that becomes payable with respect to salary and service accrued during the period of reemployment shall be payable under section 59-1361(3), Idaho Code, if the member dies during the period of reemployment.

       If a retired member who is receiving a benefit that is not reduced under section 59-1346, Idaho Code, and who has been retired for more than six (6) months, again becomes employed as defined in this section and section 59-1302(14)(A)(b), Idaho Code, as a result of being elected to a public office other than an office held prior to retirement, the retired member may elect to continue receiving benefits and not accrue additional service, in which event no contributions shall be made by the member or employer during such reemployment and any benefit payable on behalf of such member shall continue.

       If a retired schoolteacher or administrator who retired on or after age sixty (60) years, or a public safety officer who retired, and is receiving a benefit that is not reduced under section 59-1346, Idaho Code, again becomes an employee as defined in this section and section 59-1302(14), Idaho Code, as a result of returning to employment with a school district as provided in section 33-1004H, Idaho Code, the retired member may elect to continue receiving benefits and not accrue additional service, in which event no contributions shall be made by the member during such reemployment and any benefit payable on behalf of such member shall continue.

If an employer fails to properly report the employment of a retired member and it results in the retirement board making benefit payments that should have been suspended, the employer shall, in addition to paying delinquent employee and employer contributions from the date of eligibility, also be responsible for repaying to the retirement board the benefit payments made to the retired member that should have been suspended, plus interest. The employer may then recoup such payments from the retired member.

        This section was amended by two 1990 acts, ch. 231, § 61, effective July 1, 1990 and ch. 249, § 9, effective April 5, 1990, which conflict and cannot be cleanly compiled together. The surplus from the blended of the two amendments has been enclosed and corrected with brackets.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1990 amendment, by ch. 231, § 61, renumbered this section (§ 59-1351) as<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t59c13s59-1391" target="_self">§ 59-1391 </a></cite>and in subdivision (b) substituted “Firefighter” for “Fireman” and “firefighters’” for “firemen’s”; in subdivision (c) substituted “Firefighters’” for “Firemen’s”; in subdivision (e) substituted “firefighters” for “firemen” and “firefighters’” for “firemen” and in subdivision (f) substituted “firefighter’” for “firemen’”.
    The 1990 amendment, by ch. 249, § 9, in subdivision (b) added “and ‘firefighter member’” following “Fireman member’” and in subdivision (d) added “and ‘paid firefighter’” following “Paid fireman’” and substituted “mean” for “means”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 187, deleted surplus language in the section, resultant from the reconciliation of two 1990 amendments.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 380, in subsection (6), deleted “if not the schedule prescribed by section 67-5309C(a), Idaho Code” following “compensation”; in subsection (7), substituted “an award” for “a lump sum bonus,” “two thousand dollars ($2,000)” for “one thousand dollars ($1,000)” twice, inserted “under extraordinary circumstances,” and added the last sentence; in subsection (8), deleted “holding permanent status” following “employees” near the beginning, substituted “an award” for “a lump sum bonus” in the middle of the first sentence, substituted “two thousand dollars ($2,000)” for “one thousand dollars ($1,000)” twice, substituted “award” for “bonus” at the end of the first sentence, inserted “in extraordinary circumstances” in the second sentence, and added the last three sentences; and added subsections (11) through (15).
    The 2018 amendment, by ch. 117, inserted “in consultation with the division of human resources” at the end of the first sentence in subsection (1); and inserted the present second sentence in subsection (11).
