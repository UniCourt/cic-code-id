     </h3>
     <p>
      The director shall, from time to time, weigh or measure and inspect packages or amounts of commodities kept, offered, or exposed for sale, sold, or in the process of delivery, to determine whether the same contain the amounts represented and whether they be kept, offered, or exposed for sale or sold in accordance with law. When such packages or amounts of commodities are found not to contain the amounts represented, or are found to be kept, offered, or exposed for sale in violation of the law, the director may order them off sale and may so mark or tag them as to show them to be illegal. In carrying out the provisions of this act, the director may employ recognized sampling procedures under which the compliance of a given lot of packages will be determined on the basis of the result obtained on a sample selected from and representative of such lot. No person shall (1) sell, or keep, offer, or expose for sale, in intrastate commerce, any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section unless and until such package or amount of commodity has been brought into full compliance with all legal requirements, or (2) dispose of any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section and that has not been brought into compliance with legal requirements, in any manner, except with the specific approval of the director.

    The 2020 amendment, by ch. 141, rewrote the section, which formerly read: “71-402. Licensing of weighmasters. Any person acting as a public weighmaster of grains, dry peas, potato starch, dry beans, leguminous and all other small seeds, hay, wool, bulk potatoes, bulk fertilizers, sugar beets and feeds (not including minerals) or any of them shall make application to the director of the department for a weighmaster’s license. Application for a weighmaster’s license shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the director. Each applicant shall furnish satisfactory evidence of good moral character, ability to weigh accurately and to make correct weight tickets. Upon receipt of the application with satisfactory evidence of qualifications, on or before July 1, 1949, and annually thereafter, and a license fee of ten dollars ($10.00), the director shall issue an annual weighmaster’s license. No weighmaster’s license shall be issued to any applicant for such license who is under the age of eighteen (18) years, or to any person whose license issued under this act has been revoked.”
