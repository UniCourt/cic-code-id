       <p>
        Where apprentice barber successfully brought suit against the state board of barber examiners and won the right to be reexamined without additional schooling after he had failed the practical portion of the barber examination due to severe chest pains, it was within the trial court’s discretion to award costs pursuant to this section and attorney fees pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-121" target="_self">§ 12-121</a></cite>.

        Award Under Environmental Protection and Health Act.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature has made it clear that an award of expenses under the Environmental Protection and Health Act (§ 39-101 et seq.) is mandatory and unqualified, stating that a person who violates the act “shall be liable for any expense.” By using the term “any expense” rather than “costs”, the legislature apparently intended a more extensive recovery of costs than is contemplated by this section and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1). For this reason, the trial court should consider a request for costs according to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.39.html#t39c01s39-108" target="_blank">§ 39-108</a></cite>(6), rather than Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1). Idaho Dep’t of Health &amp; Welfare v. Southfork Lumber Co., 123 Idaho 146, 845 P.2d 564 (1993).

       <p>
        State was not entitled to a writ of prohibition to enjoin a district court from assessing fees for a special master against the state because the appointment of special masters and the assessment of special master costs were matters within the discretion of the district courts. Clear statutory authority existed for the award of such fees, as well direction as to how costs awarded against the state were to be paid. State v. District Court, 143 Idaho 695, 152 P.3d 566 (2007).

       </p>
       <p>
        Comparing the private attorney general doctrine with this section, the private attorney general doctrine considers the value of the prevailing party’s contribution, while this section considers the character of the losing party’s case. This difference evidences a legislative intent to make the standard of this section the basis for an attorney fee award against a state agency, rather than the tests encompassed under the private attorney general doctrine. Idaho Watersheds Project, Inc. v. State Bd. of Land Comm’rs, 128 Idaho 761, 918 P.2d 1206 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard for awarding attorney fees under this section requires focusing on the overall action of the agency, not just preliminary matters; thus, where the district court appeared to have incorrectly focused on the initial stage of applicant’s denial of registration to sell securities and not the eventual denial, denial of attorney fees was vacated and remanded for application of the proper standard and with directions to consider awarding attorney fees for this appeal if they are awarded on remand. Rincover v. State, Dep’t of Fin., 129 Idaho 442, 926 P.2d 626 (1996).

        Landowners challenged a county’s designation of roadways as public on an officially-adopted map; on appeal, the landowners sought attorney fees. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award attorney fees because, based on the record, it was impossible to conclude the commissioners’ decision was made without any reasonable support in fact.

        Attorney fees were not awarded to a dairy or the Idaho department of water resources when property owners, who were opposed to the transfer of water to the proposed dairy, did not appeal the decision transferring the water without a basis in fact.

        Employment service provider that offered a variety of services to small businesses, including insurance services, was a multiple employer welfare arrangement because it offered health benefits to two or more employers, and it violated the Idaho Code by transacting the business of insurance without a certificate of authority. On appeal, the Idaho department of insurance was entitled to costs only, and not attorney fees, because the case was one of first impression; therefore, it could not be said that the appeal was brought frivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation. Emplrs Res. Mgmt. Co. v. Dep’t of Ins., 143 Idaho 179, 141 P.3d 1048 (2006), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

        Although the appellate court disagreed with the Idaho state board of medicine’s sanctions against the doctor, it could not say the board acted without a reasonable basis in law, given the lack of clarity or standards in the discipline statute; therefore, the court denied the doctor’s request for fees.

        Comparing the private attorney general doctrine with this section, the private attorney general doctrine considers the value of the prevailing party’s contribution, while this section considers the character of the losing party’s case. This difference evidences a legislative intent to make the standard of this section the basis for an attorney fee award against a state agency, rather than the tests encompassed under the private attorney general doctrine. Idaho Watersheds Project, Inc. v. State Bd. of Land Comm’rs, 128 Idaho 761, 918 P.2d 1206 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard for awarding attorney fees under this section requires focusing on the overall action of the agency, not just preliminary matters; thus, where the district court appeared to have incorrectly focused on the initial stage of applicant’s denial of registration to sell securities and not the eventual denial, denial of attorney fees was vacated and remanded for application of the proper standard and with directions to consider awarding attorney fees for this appeal if they are awarded on remand. Rincover v. State, Dep’t of Fin., 129 Idaho 442, 926 P.2d 626 (1996).

        Landowners challenged a county’s designation of roadways as public on an officially-adopted map; on appeal, the landowners sought attorney fees. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award attorney fees because, based on the record, it was impossible to conclude the commissioners’ decision was made without any reasonable support in fact.

        Employment service provider that offered a variety of services to small businesses, including insurance services, was a multiple employer welfare arrangement because it offered health benefits to two or more employers, and it violated the Idaho Code by transacting the business of insurance without a certificate of authority. On appeal, the Idaho department of insurance was entitled to costs only, and not attorney fees, because the case was one of first impression; therefore, it could not be said that the appeal was brought frivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation. Emplrs Res. Mgmt. Co. v. Dep’t of Ins., 143 Idaho 179, 141 P.3d 1048 (2006), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

        Although the appellate court disagreed with the Idaho state board of medicine’s sanctions against the doctor, it could not say the board acted without a reasonable basis in law, given the lack of clarity or standards in the discipline statute; therefore, the court denied the doctor’s request for fees. Haw v. State Bd. of Med., 143 Idaho 51, 137 P.3d 438 (2006).

        Since the state building authority is a public instrumentality and not an agency within the meaning of this section, subsection (3) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-120" target="_self">§ 12-120 </a></cite>and not this section is the applicable section for the awarding of attorney fees in an action brought by architects against authority for architectural services performed under contract. Moreover, since the action was not brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation, attorney fees cannot be awarded under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-121" target="_self">§ 12-121</a></cite>.

        The state building authority’s function is to provide a specific service for the state at a lower cost than could be accomplished by a private entity. Its interaction with the public is of a different nature than that of a true “state agency” which “determines contested cases” or “prescribes law.” Accordingly, the authority is a public instrumentality and not an “agency” within the meaning of this section, making such section inapplicable in action by architects against authority.

        The private attorney general doctrine considers the value of the prevailing party’s contribution while this section considers the character of the losing party’s case: the difference evidences a legislative intent to make the standard of this section the basis for an attorney fee award against a state agency, rather than the tests encompassed under the private attorney general doctrine, which is not available as the basis for such an award in a case against a state agency.

        Where the basis for a request for attorney fees was an action to quiet title in real property, the outcome of which depended on the interpretation of section 47-701 and on whether sand, gravel and pumice were included in the minerals reserved by the state in that statute, the ruling that attorney fees were not awardable under the provision covering commercial transactions was affirmed. Treasure Valley Concrete, Inc. v. State, 132 Idaho 673, 978 P.2d 233 (1999), overruled on other grounds, City of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 277 P.3d 353 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court properly denied creditors’ request for attorney fees in their quiet title action against a debtor because the action involved a determination of property rights and subsection (3) of this section did not support an award of attorney fees in such an action. Quiet title action involved the determination of rights to 20 acres; it did not involve the validity or breach of a commercial lease. Merrill v. Gibson, 139 Idaho 840, 87 P.3d 949, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 926, 125 S. Ct. 311, 160 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2004).

    District court was correct by not awarding defendant attorney fees; to recover attorney fees, action must be one to recover on the contract and not merely an action arising from a transaction relating to the purchase or sale of goods, and trial court twice ruled that there was no contract between defendant as manufacturer of a product and the plaintiffs as purchasers of the product from retailer.

       <p>
        Where real estate contract between the parties provided for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party and the vendors fully prevailed on issues raised in the appeal by the buyers, vendors were awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees; yet because vendors did not prevail on their cross-appeal, buyers were entitled to costs and attorney fees under subsection (3) of this section for the defense of the cross-appeal; cost bills to be submitted by vendors and buyers were required to separately show the amounts incurred for prosecuting the appeal and cross-appeal and defending against the cross-appeal respectively. Toews v. Funk, 129 Idaho 316, 924 P.2d 217 (Ct. App. 1994).

       <p>
        Since contract of farmer bringing action claiming a breach of contract to fertilize crops was not for “personal or household purposes,” a “commercial transaction” was the gravamen of the lawsuit and farmer was entitled to award of attorney fees incurred on appeal.

       </p>
       <p>
        Actions on employment contracts are subject to the attorney fee provisions of this section; thus, employer was properly granted attorney fees it incurred in successfully defending against employee’s claims for breach of express and implied contract terms, including the claim for violation of the implied covenant of good faith. Atwood v. Western Constr. Inc., 129 Idaho 234, 923 P.2d 479 (Ct. App. 1996).

        Because in arbitration proceedings on a written contract for rebar work performed by subcontractor, subcontractor chose to frame its claim as one arising under a separate structural steel contract for which it had received full payment, rather than as a claim under the rebar contract from which the contractor had withheld funds because of claimed deficiencies in the structural work, contractor’s obligation to subcontractor had been discharged and magistrate’s dismissal of the claim and award of attorney fees were upheld.

       </p>
       <p>
        The award of attorney fees was improper because, although there was ample evidence to show that the parties entered into the purchase and sale agreement for commercial purposes, the plaintiffs’ suit was based upon a tort claim of fraud rather than upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Sowards v. Rathbun, 134 Idaho 702, 8 P.3d 1245 (2000).

        When a quasi-contract claim is presented in the alternative to a breach of contract cause of action as a fallback position in the event that the contract claim fails, and where the quasi-contract claim is based upon the same facts and circumstances as the breach of contract claim, and the alleged transaction is commercial in nature, the prevailing party is entitled to recover attorney fees under subsection (3).

    Refusal to award attorney’s fees on appeal in the parties’ contract dispute action was appropriate because the lessee did not present any argument justifying an award of attorney’s fees. In fact, the lessee did not even state that it was entitled to attorney fees. Independence Lead Mines Co. v. Hecla Mining Co., 143 Idaho 22, 137 P.3d 409 (2006).

        Because the amounts recovered by a trout hatchery that had breached a contract with a trout grower were offsets against the amounts that they were obligated to pay the grower, recognition of those amounts did not prevent the grower from being the prevailing party in their breach of contract action; therefore, the district court’s grant of attorney fees to the grower was affirmed.

        From a contractor’s suit to recover payment on a contract which ended in the homeowners’ favor, the homeowners were entitled to reasonable attorney fees relating to their defense of the contractor’s tort claim as the commercial transaction, the parties’ contract, initiated the presence of the contractor’s equipment on the homeowners’ property and was integral to the contractor’s claim.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a breach of contract and tortious interference with contract action based on a business lease, an award of attorney’s fees to plaintiff was proper, as the gravamen of the lawsuit was a commercial transaction. Gunter v. Murphy’s Lounge, L.L.C., 141 Idaho 16, 105 P.3d 676 (2005).

        Lessee was entitled to attorney’s fees, even though the underlying action sounded in tort, where lessor had alleged that the lessee was obligated under a rental agreement to indemnify it for any costs incurred in defending against a tort claim, as the rental agreement, a lease for a commercial building, met the definition of a commercial transaction. Simono v. Turner House, 160 Idaho 788, 379 P.3d 1058 (2016).

        The district court attempted to reconcile the rule requiring a timely filing of a cost memorandum with the rule permitting a motion to amend the judgment by rigidly applying the strictures of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(5); the court’s view would have required claimant to perform a virtually useless act by filing a claim for attorney fees when the court already had ruled, by its earlier judgment, that claimant was not entitled to recover any such award; until the judgment was amended with respect to the attorney fees determination, a claim for that item under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(5) would be subject to objection, and likely stricken on the ground that the question of entitlement already had been adjudicated; it was not until the court granted the later motion to amend the judgment that claimant became entitled to an award for fees. Instead of the strict approach taken by the district court, the court should have recognized that the right to costs, and an award for attorney fees, would mature anew when an amended judgment under Idaho R.

        The district court’s denial of the school district’s request for attorney fees on the grounds that the school district failed to specifically plead an amount less than $25,000 [now $35,000] was erroneous because the school district was entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party in the case.

        Although the amount involved and the results obtained are factors to be used in determining the amount of attorney fees to be awarded, as set forth in Idaho R. Civ.

    Nothing under Idaho law equates “reasonable” attorney fees to “actual” attorney fees. Subsection (3) entitles the prevailing party to a “reasonable” attorney fee. Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(e)(3) enumerates several factors to guide the reasonableness inquiry, all of which must be considered, but none of which emphasize the actual amount incurred.

        Appeal of Award of Attorney’s Fees.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A party successful on an appeal defending the award to it of attorney’s fees in a civil action seeking to recover for services performed on open account is also entitled to the award of attorney’s fees on appeal under this section. Boise Truck & Equip., Inc. v. Hafer Logging, Inc., 107 Idaho 824, 693 P.2d 470 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an appeal concerns attorney fees alone, an award of attorney fees will be made to the prevailing party if the issue on appeal includes the entitlement to a fee award below and is not limited to the amount. Spidell v. Jenkins, 111 Idaho 857, 727 P.2d 1285 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The amount of attorney fees awarded at trial is an appropriate factor in determining the award of attorney fees on appeal under this section. Phillips v. Miles, 116 Idaho 842, 780 P.2d 593 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        When reviewing a discretionary determination by the trial court regarding reasonable attorney’s fees, the appellate court conducts a multi-tiered inquiry, concerning (1) whether the lower court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the court acted within the outer boundaries of such discretion and consistent with legal standards applicable to specific choices; and (3) whether the court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.

        In actions removed from state courts, a bankruptcy court must follow the state’s substantive law; since subsection (2) (now (3)) of this section grants fees, without any qualifications, to a prevailing party in specified kinds of litigation, it is a statement of state policy substantive in nature and must be applied in removed state litigation. Wetzel v. Goldsmith (In re Comstock), 16 Bankr. 206 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1981).

        This section is inapplicable on its face to a contract for the sale of real estate. Bennett v. Bliss, 103 Idaho 358, 647 P.2d 814 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (2) (now (3)) of this section should not be extended by judicial construction to mandate an attorney fee award on appeal where the sole issue is the reasonableness of an amount awarded below, however an award still may be allowed under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-121" target="_self">§ 12-121 </a></cite>in such a case.

       <p>
        Subsection (2) (now (3)) of this section does not apply to an appeal taken solely from the amount of an award below, but it does apply where the appeal is concerned with the entitlement to an award below. Cheney v. Smith, 108 Idaho 209, 697 P.2d 1223 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, which mandates an attorney fee award rather than simply authorizing a discretionary award, produces a harsh result for the nonprevailing party whose claim or defense is meritorious but unsuccessful. Such a result can be deemed fair only if its operation is known in advance and the parties are able to guide their litigation decisions accordingly; thus, this section as amended in 1988 would not be applied retrospectively. Howard v. Blue Cross of Idaho Health Serv., Inc., 114 Idaho 485, 757 P.2d 1204 (Ct. App. 1987).
    Subsection (3) of this section was correctly applied in awarding attorney’s fees to an attorney against whom a third-party complaint for malpractice was filed by a real estate loan broker where, even though the cause of action arose prior to enactment of this subsection, the complaint was not commenced until after the effective date of this subsection. Griggs v. Nash, 116 Idaho 228, 775 P.2d 120 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action against an insurer for a breach of contract to provide coverage of medical and hospital expenses, an attorney fee award was authorized by subsection (3) of this section where although an insurance policy was issued prior to the 1986 amendment of this section, the application of the attorney fee provision was triggered only by the commencement of litigation after the amendment had become effective. Eriksen v. Blue Cross of Idaho Health Servs., Inc., 114 Idaho 485, 778 P.2d 815 (Ct. App. 1989).

        Where a petition did not request a monetary judgment, rather, it sought a review of the decision of the board of county commissioners, and asked for declaratory and injunctive relief, and no written demand for payment of an amount less than $25,000 [now $35,000] was made, this section was, therefore, inapplicable. Boise Cent. Trades & Labor Council, Inc. v. Board of Ada County Comm’rs, 122 Idaho 67, 831 P.2d 535 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        There must be a commercial transaction between the parties for attorney fees to be awarded. To the extent prior case law may be read to mandate an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party when the other party has claimed fees pursuant to paragraph (3), that interpretation is disavowed. Great Plains Equip., Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., 136 Idaho 466, 36 P.3d 218 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Two stages of analysis are utilized to determine whether a prevailing party can avail itself of paragraph (3): (1) there must be a commercial transaction that is integral to the claim; and (2) the commercial transaction must be the basis upon which recovery is sought. It has long been held that the critical test is whether the commercial transaction comprises the gravamen of the lawsuit; the commercial transaction must be integral to the claim and constitute a basis on which the party is attempting to recover. Great Plains Equip., Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., 136 Idaho 466, 36 P.3d 218 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the context of a claim for attorney fees, if more than one claim is pled, there can be more than one “gravamen,” and attorney fees can still be awarded for a specific claim, if a claim is of the type covered by paragraph (3) of this section, even though a claim is covered by other theories that would not have triggered application of the statute. Moreover, paragraph (3) cannot be invoked if the commercial transaction is between parties only indirectly related. Great Plains Equip., Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., 136 Idaho 466, 36 P.3d 218 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (3) does not authorize the awarding of attorney fees every time a commercial transaction is connected with the case. The test is whether the commercial transaction constitutes the essential part of the lawsuit. Thus, although there were commercial transactions between the two parties and other individuals or companies, but not between the parties themselves, attorney fees could not be awarded. AG Servs. of Am., Inc. v. Kechter, 137 Idaho 62, 44 P.3d 1117 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award of attorney’s fees was mandatory because a dispute between property purchasers and lenders involved a commercial transaction; the commercial transaction was integral to the claim. Grover v. Wadsworth, 147 Idaho 60, 205 P.3d 1196 (2009).

       <p>
        While a business company was not entitled to an award of attorney fees for the company’s defamation claim, the company was entitled to an award of attorneys fees for the company’s breach of contract claim, as the gravamen of that claim was the contract between the parties. However, because the district court did not allocate the attorney fees between the claims, remand for apportionment of the attorney fees was necessary. Dickinson Frozen Foods, Inc. v. J.R.

        Where a contract claim, which is covered in subsection (3) of this section, is combined with a conversion claim, which is outside the scope of this section, and the two are not separable, the fact that the conversion claim arose out of a commercial transaction is not sufficient to apply this section and award attorney fees.

        This section generally allows the Idaho supreme court to award reasonable attorney fees on appeal that are incurred in connection with the effort to secure a reasonable amount of attorney fees. However, for subsection (5) to apply, the attorney fees sought must have been “incurred in attempting to collect on the judgment.” When attempting to collect on a judgment, a party may receive attorney fees and costs pursuant to subsection (5), if that party would have been awarded attorney fees and costs under subsection (1), (2), (3), or (4) in the underlying proceeding. A request for postjudgment attorney fees under subsection (5) is not a proceeding that would satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), (2), (3), or (4) Med. Recovery Servs., LLC v.

        In an action arising from a breach of a contract to design and construct a cabin, a wholesale supplier who prevailed on summary judgment was properly awarded costs and attorney fees pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-121" target="_self">§ 12-121</a></cite>, and the supplier was not entitled to attorney fees on appeal under this section, because it only prevailed in part.

        In a contract dispute, defendants were entitled to attorney fees on appeal because they prevailed on appeal and the appeal concerned entitlement to attorney fees and not the amount of the award. Eighteen Mile Ranch, LLC v. Nord Excavating & Paving, Inc., 141 Idaho 716, 117 P.3d 130 (2005).

        While respondent prevailed on appeal, appellant presented a cogent challenge to the district court’s reading of Idaho R. Civ. P. 37(c) and presented legitimate arguments questioning the district court’s conclusion that her denial of respondents’ requests to admit was unreasonable. The appeal of the Idaho R. Civ. P. 37(c) award was not frivolous and, therefore, respondent was not entitled to attorney fees on appeal. Contreras v. Rubley, 142 Idaho 573, 130 P.3d 1111 (2006).

        In the trout farmers’ breach of a commercial sales contract action against a fish hatchery, awarding the trout farmers attorney fees after remand pursuant to their contingency fee agreement, rather than on an hourly basis as they had previously been awarded, was reasonable considering the attorney fees as a whole, despite the late switch regarding the method of computation. Griffith v. Clear Lakes Trout Co., 146 Idaho 613, 200 P.3d 1162 (2009).

       <p>
        This section generally allows the Idaho supreme court to award reasonable attorney fees on appeal that are incurred in connection with the effort to secure a reasonable amount of attorney fees. However, for subsection (5) to apply, the attorney fees sought must have been “incurred in attempting to collect on the judgment.” When attempting to collect on a judgment, a party may receive attorney fees and costs pursuant to subsection (5), if that party would have been awarded attorney fees and costs under subsection (1), (2), (3), or (4) in the underlying proceeding. A request for postjudgment attorney fees under subsection (5) is not a proceeding that would satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), (2), (3), or (4) Med. Recovery Servs., LLC v. Siler, 162 Idaho 30, 394 P.3d 73 (2017). Award Proper.

        When an order awarding attorney’s fees is correct, but has been entered upon an erroneous theory, it will be upheld upon the proper theory. Camp v. Jiminez, 107 Idaho 878, 693 P.2d 1080 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the party successfully defended against the action for recovery on the note, he was entitled to reasonable attorney fees. Spidell v. Jenkins, 111 Idaho 857, 727 P.2d 1285 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the city’s contract for the supplying and installing of the secondary treatment equipment in the sewage treatment plant was for the sale of goods, as defined by the UCC, the district court did not err in awarding the city attorney fees pursuant to subsection (2) (now subsection (3)) of this section. United States v. City of Twin Falls, 806 F.2d 862 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 914, 107 S. Ct. 3185, 96 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the judge heard argument and received affidavits regarding a reasonable attorney fee and he determined that the fees requested were appropriate in light of extensive discovery work and pretrial hearings, the judge did not abuse his discretion. Davidson v. Beco Corp., 112 Idaho 560, 733 P.2d 781 (Ct. App. 1986), modified on other grounds, 114 Idaho 107, 753 P.2d 1253 (1987).

        Where lessee of farm failed to present a persuasive argument that the district court erred in ordering farm equipment contractor, instead of the lessor of farm, to pay the costs and attorney fees expended by lessee in successfully defending against the claims of contractor, the district court’s order that contractor pay lessee’s costs and attorney fees was affirmed. Tri-Circle, Inc. v. Brugger Corp., 121 Idaho 950, 829 P.2d 540 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff pled actual damages, including a prayer for attorney fees, and where he prayed for leave to amend his complaint to seek punitive damages in addition to actual damages sought, defendant had sufficient notice of amount of plaintiff’s claim as well as his intent to seek attorney fees; thus award of attorney fees was proper. Downey Chiropractic Clinic v. Nampa Restaurant Corp., 127 Idaho 283, 900 P.2d 191 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state made an adequate request for attorney fees under subsection (3), and since the state was the prevailing party in the appeal, the state was awarded reasonable attorney fees on appeal. Clark v. State, 134 Idaho 527, 5 P.3d 988 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a party alleged the existence of a contractual relationship of a type embraced by subsection (3), that claim triggered the application of the statute, and the prevailing party recovered fees even though no liability under a contract was established. Intermountain Forest Mgmt., Inc. v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp., 136 Idaho 233, 31 P.3d 921 (2001).

        Where a court stated it awarded an engineering firm attorney fees in the amount of $61,846, the record provided sufficient information to presume that the court had considered the pertinent factors of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3); the writings submitted by the parties in connection with the claim for attorney fees addressed several of the factors listed in Idaho R. Civ.

        Property owners, as defendants in a personal injury action, were entitled to attorney fees under subsection (4) of this section where a “claimant” referred to a prevailing party (plaintiff or defendant) claiming attorney fees in an action meeting the other requirements of the statute; the legislature used the term “plaintiff” in (4) when modifying subsection (1) but when it addressed the right to an award it used the term “claimant” which in context may be either a plaintiff or a defendant.

       <p>
        Where the employee sued his employer for breach of contract and tort claims arising from his termination, his employer, as the prevailing party upon summary judgment, was entitled to an award of $35,000 in attorney fees. The fees attributable to the defense of the contract-related claims were sufficiently isolated from fees attributable to the defense of the other claims to make the award of attorney fees calculable. Jenkins v. Boise Cascade Corp., 141 Idaho 233, 108 P.3d 380 (2005).
       </p>

       <p>
        In a dispute over a land sale contract, a district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees under this section because the factors under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3) were considered, itemized memoranda and affidavits of costs were analyzed, and items were removed if they were deemed excessive. P.O. Ventures, Inc. v.

Hausam v. Schnabl, 126 Idaho 569, 887 P.2d 1076 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nature of suit by party claiming that it was a third party beneficiary of a contract between contractor and subcontractor’s successor was construed by the court of appeals to be sufficiently based on a commercial transaction to warrant an award of fees under this section. Cannon Bldrs., Inc. v. Rice, 126 Idaho 616, 888 P.2d 790 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The principle that where a party alleges the existence of a contractual relationship of a type embraced by subsection (3) of this section, that claim triggers the application of this section and a prevailing party may recover fees even though no liability under a contract was established, could be applied in the instant case, where the action was one to recover in a commercial transaction, regardless of the proof that the commercial transaction alleged, did, in fact occur. Magic Lantern Prods., Inc. v. Dolsot, 126 Idaho 805, 892 P.2d 480 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the case, which arose from a failed venture to develop a Christian retreat, did not involve a contract for the sale of goods or services, that part of this section was inapplicable, and that as to whether or not a commercial transaction was apparent in the instant case, the proper inquiry was whether or not the commercial transaction composed the gravamen of the lawsuit and was integral to the claim and constituted the basis upon which the party was attempting to recover; as the district court found the gravamen of the instant case was fraud, refusing to award fees was proper. Spence v. Howell, 126 Idaho 763, 890 P.2d 714 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A transaction for commercial farming operations was found to be a “commercial transaction” under this section, and the lease between parties allowed defendants to utilize the property for the purpose of operating a commercial cattle ranch; therefore, the lease was a commercial transaction, and the defendants were entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees. Herrick v. Leuzinger, 127 Idaho 293, 900 P.2d 201 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        An accounting, a winding up of the partnership affairs, and a distribution of the partnership assets did not constitute a “commercial transaction” under this section. Kelly v. Silverwood Estates, 127 Idaho 624, 903 P.2d 1321 (1995).
    An award of attorney fees is not warranted every time a commercial transaction is remotely connected with a case; rather, the test is whether the commercial transaction comprises the gravamen of the lawsuit, as attorney fees are not appropriate under this section unless the commercial transaction is integral to the claim and constitutes the basis upon which the party is attempting to recover. Kelly v. Silverwood Estates, 127 Idaho 624, 903 P.2d 1321 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the gravamen of action was a “commercial transaction,” insurer was entitled to an award of attorney fees and fact that insurer brought the action rather than waiting to be sued had no bearing on issue. Continental Cas. Co. v. Brady, 127 Idaho 830, 907 P.2d 807 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a party’s claim is based on the statutory penalties provided in former § 30-1-52 for the corporation’s failure to provide access to the corporate records, the gravamen of the suit is the statutory provision and not a commercial transaction, thus attorney fees should be denied under subdivision (3) of this section. Gumprecht v. Doyle, 128 Idaho 242, 912 P.2d 610 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action where the gravamen was plaintiff’s enforcement of option to purchase commercial farming property, the basis of the action was a commercial transaction and, therefore, prevailing party was entitled to attorney’s fees under subsection (3) of this section. Dennett v. Kuenzli, 130 Idaho 21, 936 P.2d 219 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the breach of contract claim was redressed in the arbitration proceedings, the court properly found that the plaintiff’s complaint did not deal with a “commercial transaction,” as contemplated by this section. Storrer v. Kier Constr. Corp., 129 Idaho 745, 932 P.2d 373 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test for the application of allowing the prevailing party in a civil action to recover on “any commercial transaction” is whether the commercial transaction comprises the gravamen of the lawsuit; that is, whether the commercial transaction is integral to the claim and constitutes the basis upon which the party is attempting to recover. Dennett v. Kuenzli, 130 Idaho 21, 936 P.2d 219 (Ct. App. 1997); Clayson v. Zebe, 153 Idaho 228, 280 P.3d 731 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides for attorney fees incurred if the suit involved a commercial transaction; the district court considered the stipulation of the parties to be a commercial contract and the action for recovery of damages for the negligent performance of the contract to be a “commercial transaction”. Powell v. Sellers, 130 Idaho 122, 937 P.2d 434 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in a case involving a commercial transaction, the supreme court reversed a jury verdict as to counts I and II, relieving defendant of liability, the question of attorney fees was a subsidiary issue fairly comprised therein and on remand the district court had the jurisdiction to consider whether defendant was the prevailing party and to make an award of costs and attorney fees. J.R. Simplot Co. v. Chemetics Int’l, Inc., 130 Idaho 255, 939 P.2d 574 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case involving a commercial transaction, since subsection (3) of this section requires that a court hearing any action arising out of a commercial transaction shall award attorney fees to the prevailing party and such subsection has been interpreted to mandate the award of attorney fees on appeal as well as at trial, defendant, as the prevailing party on appeal, was entitled to be awarded costs and attorney fees. J.R. Simplot Co. v. Chemetics Int’l, Inc., 130 Idaho 255, 939 P.2d 574 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The present action was primarily a property dispute to determine ownership and easement rights and did not fall within the meaning of a commercial transaction under subsection (3) of this section; therefore attorney fees were properly denied. Sun Valley Hot Springs Ranch, Inc. v. Kelsey, 131 Idaho 657, 962 P.2d 1041 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A joint venture for the purpose of maximizing the value of certain real estate is a “commercial transaction” within the meaning of this section. Tri State Land Co. v. Roberts, 131 Idaho 835, 965 P.2d 195 (Ct. App. 1998).

    An action by an unsuccessful bidder on a city contract is not a “commercial transaction” under this section, as the gravamen of the action was to contest a bid by the city and there was no contract between the plaintiff and the city. Andrea v. City of Coeur d’Alene, 132 Idaho 188, 968 P.2d 1097 (Ct. App. 1998).

       </p>

        Where an underlying action was one to recover on an alleged exclusivity contract, the action involved a commercial transaction and this section was triggered. General Auto Parts Co. v. Genuine Parts Co., 132 Idaho 849, 979 P.2d 1207 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a commercial transaction is at an end does not preclude that transaction from being integral to a claim, and where plaintiff was seeking damages for defendant’s alleged breach of an agreement modifying the terms of a commercial loan, both the original loan and the alleged oral agreement were commercial transactions within the statutory definition in subsection (3) of this section. Rule Sales & Serv., Inc. v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, 133 Idaho 669, 991 P.2d 857 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the action was primarily a dispute over property ownership and easement rights, it did not fall within the meaning of a commercial transaction as defined in subsection (3) of this section and as applied by the courts. Baxter v. Craney, 135 Idaho 166, 16 P.3d 263 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section did not apply where the action was primarily a dispute over whether the properties in question were conveyed in fee simple or as easements, because the question did not fall within the meaning of a commercial transaction as defined in subsection (3). C & G, Inc. v. Rule, 135 Idaho 763, 25 P.3d 76 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Test for determining whether subsection (3) of this section authorizes an award of attorney fees is whether the commercial transaction comprises the gravamen of the lawsuit. This requires that there be a commercial transaction that is integral to the claim, and that the commercial transaction is the basis upon which recovery is sought. Erickson v. Flynn, 138 Idaho 430, 64 P.3d 959 (Ct. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees are not authorized under subsection (3) of this section, where a tort claim is involved, even if the claim is intimately associated with a commercial transaction. Erickson v. Flynn, 138 Idaho 430, 64 P.3d 959 (Ct. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a tort action, a painter and attorney were not entitled to attorney fees under subsection (3) of this section, despite the fact that the underlying action was based on a commercial transaction; that statute does not apply to a claim for attorney fees when the action involves a tort, even if the underlying action was a commercial transaction. McPheters v. Maile, 138 Idaho 391, 64 P.3d 317, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 888, 124 S. Ct. 269, 157 L. Ed. 2d 159 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees were awardable to the witness under subsection (3) of this section for successfully defending an action to recover on a note; the appellate court would not consider whether the district court erred in holding that this was an action on a commercial transaction because, even if that was in error, the credit had not challenged the district court’s alternative holding that this was an action to recover on a note. Bream v. Benscoter, 139 Idaho 364, 79 P.3d 723 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees are not appropriate under subsection (3) of this section unless the commercial transaction is integral to the claim and constitutes the basis upon which the party is attempting to recover. It is of no consequence that the underlying contractual obligation is unenforceable. A prevailing party may recover attorney fees even though no liability under a contract was established or where no contract was, in fact, ever formed. Garner v. Bartschi, 139 Idaho 430, 80 P.3d 1031 (2003).

    Where a trial court on remand was instructed to determine whether a broker forfeited any or all of his development commission because he was found under a general verdict to have breached a real estate agreement with landowners, on remand the broker was properly awarded attorney fees as to his claim to recover his commission because such was a claim to recover in a commercial transaction as contemplated in subsection (3) of this section and the broker prevailed on that claim.

       <p>
        Dismissal of the physician’s action against the hospital seeking to force the hospital to grant him medical staff privileges was proper where the physician was not denied due process and the tribunal was impartial; further, an award of attorney fees under subsection (3) of this section was also proper because the physician’s allegation of a contract between him and the hospital that was for other than personal or household purposes constituted the allegation of a commercial transaction. Miller v. St. Alphonsus Reg’l Med. Ctr., Inc., 139 Idaho 825, 87 P.3d 934 (2004).

        Grant of summary judgment in favor of the company was proper where the company did not enter into any agreement or make any representation to pay the wife her community property interest in the husband’s shares in the event of divorce; further, the district court did not err in denying the company an award of attorney fees pursuant to subsection (3) of this section because the case did not implicate a commercial transaction. Tolley v. THI Co., 140 Idaho 253, 92 P.3d 503 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospective buyer was not entitled to an award of attorney fees under subsection (3) of this section because the complaint did not allege any commercial transaction between him and the developer, it simply alleged that by his conduct the buyer interfered with a commercial transaction between the developer and the landowners. With respect to the landowners, the complaint did allege a commercial transaction, and because the landowners’ counterclaim still remained to be resolved, the district court had not yet determined whether they were prevailing parties in the lawsuit, such that if the district court determined that they were the prevailing parties once their counterclaim was resolved, it may award them attorney fees. Lexington Heights Dev., LLC v. Crandlemire, 140 Idaho 276, 92 P.3d 526 (2004).

       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees were properly awarded under this section in an action to enforce a restrictive employment covenant; the employment contract was a commercial transaction pursuant to subsection (3), and the fact that this was a declaratory judgment action did not preclude awarding attorney fees.

        Homebuilder was not entitled to an award of attorney fees where the complaint did not plead damages of $25,000 [now $35,000] or less, but sought damages trebled in such amount as shown by the evidence but not less than $15,000; pleading damages in an amount that was not less than a specified sum was not the same as pleading damages in the amount of $25,000 [now $35,000] or less. Gillespie v. Mt. Park Estates, L.L.C., 142 Idaho 671, 132 P.3d 428 (2006).

       <p>
        Subsection (3) of this section did not provide a basis for awarding attorney fees in a case involving the validity and location of an easement where an agreement giving rise to the easement was not a “commercial transaction” and was not an integral aspect of the dispute nor the basis upon which recovery was sought. Bedke v. Pickett Ranch & Sheep Co., 143 Idaho 36, 137 P.3d 423 (2006).
    Customer was entitled to a fee award with respect to his fraud claim, as he was seeking recovery of damages sustained as a result of the commercial transaction involved in the case; a transaction involving the sale of 26,500 pairs of jeans was not made for personal or household purposes, but was a business or commercial transaction, as the customer obviously intended to market the jeans rather than wear them. Blimka v. My Web Wholesaler, LLC., 143 Idaho 723, 152 P.3d 594 (2007).
       </p>

       </p>

        In an action to quiet title, neither party could receive attorney’s fees, because “any commercial transaction,” for the purposes of subsection (3), does not include real estate transactions or issues involving the ownership of property. Anderson v. Rex Hayes Family Trust, 145 Idaho 741, 185 P.3d 253 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        The critical test in determining whether a civil action is for a commercial transaction is whether the commercial transaction comprises the gravamen of the lawsuit; it must be integral to the claim and constitute the basis upon which the party is attempting to recover. Johannsen v. Utterbeck, 146 Idaho 423, 196 P.3d 341 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a party alleges the existence of a contract that would be a commercial transaction under subsection (3), that claim triggers the application of this section, and the prevailing party may recover attorney fees, even if no liability under the contract is established.

        Although attorney fees, under subsection (2) (now (3)) of this section, could not be awarded in a claim and delivery action to recover a vehicle or its fair market value, where the defendant’s counterclaim asserted a right under a contract of sale, attorney fees could be awarded to the defendant on his counterclaim.

        The general rule that attorney’s fees cannot be recovered in an action unless authorized by statute or by express agreement of the parties precludes a court from implying a contract term allowing attorney fees to a party to the contract.

       <p>
        In an action for breach of a real estate listing contract, the court of appeals declined to convert an express provision for award of attorney fees to one party to an implied provision for an award of attorney fees to either party since Idaho courts are not free to imply a reciprocal meaning to attorney fees provisions in contract.

        A district court’s determination when awarding attorney’s fees that an action was frivolously defended will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion; however, the district court must consider all relevant factors in exercising its sound discretion.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although the district court was vested with the discretion to determine the amount of attorney fees to award for the appeal from the magistrate’s division, the district court, sitting in its appellate capacity, was not the proper forum for determination of the amount of an award of attorney fees incurred during a trial before the magistrate, rather the magistrate conducting the trial should have heard any objection and argument in relation to attorney fees for the trial.

       </p>

        Attorney’s fees are not warranted under this section whenever a commercial transaction is remotely connected with the case; although the plaintiffs based their claims on two contractual theories, the main thrust of their suit clearly sounded in tort, and the court declined to award fees on that basis. Sammis v. MagneTek, Inc., 130 Idaho 342, 941 P.2d 314 (1997).
    The district court’s award and calculation of attorney fees was affirmed where that court recognized that the calculation was discretionary, where it acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistent with the applicable legal standards, and where it arrived at its amount by an exercise of reason.

In re Astle, 364 B.R. 735 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2007).

        Award of legal fees was authorized to a Chapter 7 debtor who, when sued by his former employer for violating a noncompetition agreement, had prevailed on the issue of whether his conduct justified nondischargeability, under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(6), even though the former employer had prevailed on the issue of whether employee had breached the agreement.

        In a negligence action by a bailor against a bailee to recover damages caused when the bailee crashed an airplane rented from the bailor, subsection (1) of this section was inapplicable on the pleadings since the bailor’s complaint contained two counts, pleading damages of $2,000 and $4,000, respectively; subsection (2) (now (3)) of this section was inapplicable on its face because although there was a bailment agreement, the bailor’s underlying cause of action was grounded in negligence, not in contract.

        Even though the contract between the defendant farm equipment company and the farm owner related to the purchase and sale of goods, the actions brought by the farm owner and his tenants were not to recover upon that contract, but to recover damages for breach of another legal duty, the duty to exercise reasonable care in installing the goods; accordingly, the farm owner and his tenants were not entitled to attorney fees under subsection (2) (now (3)) of this section.

        Even though evidence of $2,500 in property damage was not in respondent’s statement of claim, it was not significant enough to constitute a waiver of his right to attorney fees, compared to the $ 20,000 demand made in the statement of claim, and since appellant’s insurer disclaimed any liability for the accident, it was difficult to see how a lack of awareness of damage to the car played any part in insurer’s refusal to settle prior to the commencement of the suit.

        Plaintiffs’ increased request for damages at trial did not constitute “a significant new item of damage” that precluded them from obtaining fees under subsection (4).

        Because subsection (3) of this section mandates the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising out of civil action to recover on an open account, and the burden is on the person disputing the award to show an abuse of discretion, where plaintiffs failed to provide the court with any legal authority or argument establishing an abuse of discretion by the trial court, the district court or the court of appeals, the decisions awarding attorney fees were affirmed. Eagle Water Co. v. Roundy Pole Fence Co., 134 Idaho 626, 7 P.3d 1103 (2000). Pleading.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the Idaho supreme court presumes that the state legislature understood the meaning of the term “pleading” in the procedural sense when it enacted this section, the court held that a prevailing party cannot claim an entitlement to attorney fees pursuant to this section unless damages of $25,000 [now $35,000] or less actually have been pled. Cox v. Mueller, 125 Idaho 734, 874 P.2d 545 (1994).

       <p>
        Because subdivision (1) of this section requires a party to specify the maximum amount of damages claimed and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c03s5-335" target="_blank">§ 5-335 </a></cite>forbids a personal injury plaintiff from claiming a specific amount of damages, the statutes admittedly are difficult to reconcile. Therefore, to invoke the entitlement to attorney fees pursuant to this section, the complaint should also allege that the plaintiff’s claim for damages does not exceed the limit established by this section and that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant to this section; since this allegation will not specify the precise amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff, it will not violate<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c03s5-335" target="_blank">§ 5-335</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        The court could not award attorney fees to the department of health and welfare when it prevailed in seeking child support from a father; the department failed to indicate in its complaint whether the total reimbursement and support requested was $25,000 [now $35,000] or less and, therefore, attorney fees could not be awarded pursuant to this section. State, Bureau of Child Support v. Knowles, 128 Idaho 835, 919 P.2d 1036 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the court places a “premium” on examining the pleadings when evaluating the applicability of this section, plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees only where it had clearly indicated that it sought to recover from the defendants an amount less than $25,000 [now $35,000] plus attorney fees. Aberdeen-Springfield Canal Co. v. Peiper, 133 Idaho 82, 982 P.2d 917 (1999).

        Parties need not identify in the judgment the specific subsection of this section under which attorney fees are sought when the applicable provision has been clearly identified.

        After judgment had been perfected in this case, plaintiff became a judgment creditor and no longer depended on the note as the basis of defendant’s obligation; accordingly, while an award of pre-judgment attorney fees was made to plaintiff without objection, subdivision (3) of this section does not provide for a post-judgment award of attorney fees; further, Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(5) explicitly limits the time period in which a memorandum of costs can be filed to 14 days after the entry of judgment and in the instant action the judgment was entered on September 12, 1988, and the memorandum of costs seeking an additional award of post-judgment attorney fees was filed on June 21, 1990, nearly 21 months later.

        The identification of a prevailing party rests in the trial court’s sound discretion; however, a judge may not use the award or denial of attorney fees to vindicate his sense of justice beyond the judgment rendered on the underlying dispute between the parties.

        Where the party who defaulted on the promissory note successfully resisted the recovery of a deficiency, and the district judge stated that he would not award attorney fees because he considered the case to be a “draw,” with no prevailing party, even though he acknowledged having no legal basis for doing what he was doing but his own sense of justice, the action was remanded to determine whether the party prevailed in district court.

        The determination of a prevailing party involves a three-part inquiry; the court must examine (1) the result obtained in relation to the relief sought; (2) whether there were multiple claims or issues; and (3) the extent to which either party prevailed on each issue or claim. Jerry J. Joseph C.L.U. Ins. Assocs. v. Vaught, 117 Idaho 555, 789 P.2d 1146 (Ct. App. 1990).
    The determination of which party has prevailed is not a matter of a mechanical measurement of the size of each party’s respective recovery; instead, the trial court should analyze each claim separately, and where both parties have successfully asserted claims, the claims should be severed and costs analyzed separately for each.

       <p>
        A court is permitted to examine the reasonableness of the time and labor expended by the attorney and need not blindly accept the figures advanced by the attorney; such figures may be measured against a standard of reasonableness. An attorney cannot spend his time extravagantly and expect to be compensated by the party who loses at trial; thus, in an action to recover less than $2,000, where the claim for attorney fees amounted to $9,000, the district court did not err in allowing only $3,000.

       </p>

        An award of attorney fees in the lower court, based on a contingency agreement, may be enough to subsume any amount that might be awarded for attorney fees on appeal; ultimately, the determination of reasonableness will rest with the trial court after it has recalculated the interest award and reconsidered all the factors under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3). Hoopes v. Hoopes, 124 Idaho 518, 861 P.2d 88 (Ct. App. 1993).

        What constitutes a “reasonable” fee is a discretionary determination for the trial court, to be guided by the criteria of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3), and a court may disallow fees that were unnecessarily and unreasonably incurred or that were the product of attorney churning. Daisy Mfg. Co. v. Paintball Sports, Inc., 134 Idaho 259, 999 P.2d 914 (Ct. App. 2000).
    What constitutes a reasonable fee is a discretionary determination for the trial court, to be guided by the criteria of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3). Sanders v. Lankford, 134 Idaho 322, 1 P.3d 823 (Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reasonableness of an attorney fee award is based on the trial court’s consideration of the factors in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3). The court need not specifically address all of the factors contained in that rule in writing, so long as the record clearly indicates that the court considered them all. Thomas v. Thomas, 150 Idaho 636, 249 P.3d 829 (2011).

       The reasonableness of an attorney fee award is based on the trial court’s consideration of the factors in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3). The court need not specifically address all of the factors contained in that rule in writing, so long as the record clearly indicates that the court considered them all. Thomas v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Even if a county’s contract with a construction company is not absolutely void as between the parties to it, the lowest responsible bidder may nevertheless be entitled to injunctive relief against the company’s continued performance without a public works contractor’s license, and the lowest responsible bidder should be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees for the original proceedings in the trial court and on appeal. McKay Constr. Co. v. Ada County Bd. of County Comm’rs, 99 Idaho 235, 580 P.2d 412 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the vendors’ action for money damages and judicial sale may not have been the specific form of action contemplated by this provision for attorney’s fees, when this provision is read together with the other contractual provisions on remedies, which provide that the forfeiture remedy is not exclusive but cumulative to other remedies, it becomes apparent that the parties intended that the vendors be entitled to an award of attorney’s fees in the event judicial action was necessary to enforce the terms of the real estate contract. Christensen v. Christensen, 100 Idaho 733, 605 P.2d 80 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The more restrictive criteria set forth in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), for determining entitlement to an award of attorney’s fees under this section, are not applicable where claim for attorney’s fees is based upon a contract. Bank of Idaho v. Colley, 103 Idaho 320, 647 P.2d 776 (Ct. App. 1982).

        Even if a county’s contract with a construction company is not absolutely void as between the parties to it, the lowest responsible bidder may nevertheless be entitled to injunctive relief against the company’s continued performance without a public works contractor’s license, and the lowest responsible bidder should be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees for the original proceedings in the trial court and on appeal. McKay Constr. Co. v. Ada County Bd. of County Comm’rs, 99 Idaho 235, 580 P.2d 412 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the vendors’ action for money damages and judicial sale may not have been the specific form of action contemplated by this provision for attorney’s fees, when this provision is read together with the other contractual provisions on remedies, which provide that the forfeiture remedy is not exclusive but cumulative to other remedies, it becomes apparent that the parties intended that the vendors be entitled to an award of attorney’s fees in the event judicial action was necessary to enforce the terms of the real estate contract. Christensen v. Christensen, 100 Idaho 733, 605 P.2d 80 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The more restrictive criteria set forth in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), for determining entitlement to an award of attorney’s fees under this section, are not applicable where claim for attorney’s fees is based upon a contract. Bank of Idaho v. Colley, 103 Idaho 320, 647 P.2d 776 (Ct. App. 1982).
    In an insurance coverage case, in which the insurer sought a judicial declaration that under a homeowner’s insurance policy it was neither obligated to defend the insured nor to cover claims against him arising from injuries sustained by the insured’s son in a swimming pool accident and in which the insurer ultimately prevailed, the court determined that there was a clear enough question of the insurance policy’s proper interpretation such that the award of attorney’s fees should be denied. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. Roberts, 128 Idaho 232, 912 P.2d 119 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, initially awarded default judgment in his breach of contract counterclaim and prevailing on plaintiff’s appeal to set aside judgment on Idaho R. Civ. P. 60(b) grounds, was awarded costs and attorney’s fees. In an action on a contract,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-120" target="_self">§ 12-120</a></cite>(3) generally mandates an award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party on appeal as well as at trial. Tyler v. Keeney, 128 Idaho 524, 915 P.2d 1382 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where real estate contract between the parties provided for an award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party and the vendors fully prevailed on issues raised in the appeal by the buyers, vendors were awarded costs and reasonable attorney’s fees; yet because vendors did not prevail on their cross-appeal, buyers were entitled to costs and attorney’s fees under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-120" target="_self">§ 12-120</a></cite>(3) for the defense of the cross-appeal; cost bills to be submitted by vendors and buyers were required to separately show the amounts incurred for prosecuting the appeal and cross-appeal and defending against the cross-appeal respectively. Toews v. Funk, 129 Idaho 316, 924 P.2d 217 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action arising from a breach of a contract to design and construct a cabin, a wholesale supplier who prevailed on summary judgment was properly awarded costs and attorney’s fees pursuant to this section. Nelson v. Anderson Lumber Co., 140 Idaho 702, 99 P.3d 1092 (Ct. App. 2004).

       <p>
        Prior to the enactment of this section in 1976, there was no statute which authorized the award of attorney’s fees on appeal in mechanic’s lien foreclosure actions. Therefore, since there was no other “statute which otherwise provides for the award of attorney’s fees” in mechanic’s lien foreclosure actions, this section authorized the supreme court to award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party. Acoustic Specialties, Inc. v. Wright, 103 Idaho 595, 651 P.2d 529 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the narrow focus of appeal by landlord from judgment imposing materialman’s lien was upon the application of settled law to undisputed facts and the landlord made no substantial showing that the district court misapplied the law, the court concluded that the appeal was brought and pursued without foundation and attorney’s fees would be awarded to the contractor in an amount to be determined as provided by Idaho App. R. 41(d). Christensen v. Idaho Land Developers, Inc., 104 Idaho 458, 660 P.2d 70 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is the only statute which authorizes an award of attorney’s fees, on appeal, in actions to foreclose liens for labor and materials. Such an award will be made if the appeal has been brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Christensen v. Idaho Land Developers, Inc., 104 Idaho 458, 660 P.2d 70 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>

Civ. P. 68 clearly entitles a party tendering offer of judgment to those costs accrued following an offer of judgment where the damages awarded are less than the offer of judgment where the trial court found pursuant to subsection (B) of Idaho R.

        Section 45-513 provides no basis for a successful lien claimant to receive attorney’s fees on appeal. However, that does not insulate lien foreclosure cases from discretionary awards of attorney’s fees on appeal under this section. Therefore, where the appellate court has left with the abiding belief that an appeal was brought without foundation, it appropriately awarded attorney’s fees on appeal to the appellee. W.F. Constr.

        After plaintiff’s attorneys had lost on their lien claim for fees and costs in one county, the appropriate remedy would have been to perfect an appeal in that proceeding, and subjecting the defendants to further litigation in another county on the same issue was unreasonable; the court also decided that, once the res judicata defense became blatantly apparent, further litigation became frivolous and an award of fees was properly made under Idaho R.

        Where an appeal in a divorce a case is brought frivolously and without foundation, an appellate court may award fees under this section. In such case, the amount awarded is fixed by reference to Idaho R. Civ.

        Where an appeal in a divorce a case is brought frivolously and without foundation, an appellate court may award fees under this section. In such case, the amount awarded is fixed by reference to Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3) which enables the judge to consider the factors listed in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.32.html#t32c07s32-705" target="_blank">§ 32-705 </a></cite>and incorporated by reference into<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.32.html#t32c07s32-704" target="_blank">§ 32-704</a></cite>(2). In this way, this section plays a role in divorce cases without unduly encroaching upon the financial assistance scheme contemplated by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.32.html#t32c07s32-704" target="_blank">§ 32-704</a></cite>(2).

        Where husband, appealing property division pursuant to divorce proceeding, attempted to reargue facts that he was unable to establish at trial, attempted to introduce new facts and evidence that were not in the record below, and made no cogent legal arguments or request for a repeal or modification of existing law, an award of attorney’s fees under this section and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) was appropriate. Huerta v. Huerta, 127 Idaho 77, 896 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where record did not indicate that either party in modification proceeding brought, pursued, or responded unreasonably or frivolously to appeal, an award of attorney’s fees to either party would have been inappropriate in case. Jensen v. Jensen, 128 Idaho 600, 917 P.2d 757 (1996).

        Because ex-husband, seeking attorney’s fees in appeal, which affirmed judgment denying ex-wife past spousal support payments, failed to include any argument to support the claim to attorney’s fees, his request was summarily denied. Toyama v. Toyama, 129 Idaho 142, 922 P.2d 1068 (1996).

        Where former husband presented no argument or authority to show that the magistrate abused its discretion in dividing and valuing retirement benefits under the reserved jurisdiction method by utilizing established time rule instead of the accrued benefits method the district court properly awarded former wife attorney’s fees pursuant to the appeal. Moreover, the former wife was entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to former husband’s appeal to the supreme court. Hunt v. Hunt, 137 Idaho 18, 43 P.3d 777 (2002).
    Considering the almost eight years of litigation and the fact that the father acted as his own attorney repeatedly and brought the instant appeal without factual basis, the appeal was frivolous, unreasonable, and without foundation; as such, an award of attorney fees on appeal to the mother was appropriate.

    In case filed prior to adoption of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), a trial court could award attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in its discretion, without the limitations now stated in the rule. Briscoe v. Nishitani, 105 Idaho 175, 667 P.2d 278 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if Idaho R. Civ.

P. 54(e)(1) on March 1, 1979, and the court chose the latter and stated reasons for that choice, there was no abuse of discretion in making that decision. Ladd v.

       <p>
        In determining whether Idaho R. Civ.

P. 54(e)(1) was not applicable to case filed prior to adoption of rule, even though attorney’s fees were awarded after effective date of rule, and the award of attorney’s fees under this section was within the discretion of the trial court.

        Idaho R. Civ.

       </p>
       <p>
        Section 12-120(2) should not be extended by judicial construction to mandate an attorney fee award on appeal where the sole issue is the reasonableness of an amount awarded below, however an award still may be allowed under this section in such a case.

        It was within the discretion of the district court to award attorney’s fees under this section without making findings as required by Idaho R. Civ.

        Where the action was instituted prior to the effective date of Idaho R. Civ.

Curtis v. City of Ketchum, 111 Idaho 27, 720 P.2d 210 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees should be awarded under this section only if the position advocated by the nonprevailing party is plainly fallacious and, therefore, not fairly debatable. Associates N.W. v. Beets, 112 Idaho 603, 733 P.2d 824 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the action was filed before March 1, 1979, the effective date of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), an award of fees under this section was not contingent upon a finding that the action was defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation; standing alone this section gave the district court broad discretion to award attorney’s fees. R.T. Nahas Co. v. Hulet, 114 Idaho 23, 752 P.2d 625 (Ct. App. 1988).
    This section has been supplemented by Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) and 54(e)(2). Rule 54(e)(1) provides that attorney’s fees under this section may be awarded only when the court finds that the case was brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Additionally, Rule 54(e)(2) requires the court — whenever an award of fees is made pursuant to this section — to make a written finding, either in the award or in a separate document, as to the basis and reasons for awarding such fees. The purpose of giving the reasons for such an award (as well as stating reasons when no award is made) is to provide the appellate court with a meaningful basis to review the trial court’s exercise of discretion. Needs v. Idaho State Dep’t of Cor., 115 Idaho 399, 766 P.2d 1280 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), an award of attorney’s fees under this section may be made only if the trial court finds that a claim was brought or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Jerry J.

       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees may not be awarded under this section and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) when there is a legitimate, triable issue of fact to be submitted to a jury, but one (or perhaps both) of the parties assert legal or factual issues which have no support in the law or the facts. Turner v. Willis, 119 Idaho 1023, 812 P.2d 737 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where wife argued that an award of attorney’s fees at trial and on appeal to the district court was proper under this section and under provisions of the parties settlement agreement, the supreme court held that an award of attorney’s fees could not be based on this section because Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) supplemented this section and allowed attorney’s fees to be awarded by the court only if an action was brought frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation, which was not the situation in the instant case. Noble v. Fisher, 126 Idaho 885, 894 P.2d 118 (1995).

        Where the magistrate found that the children of the deceased were the prevailing parties in an action to remove the personal representative of the estate and that they met the criteria for an award of attorney’s fees under this section and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1)(B), and where the magistrate further found, pursuant to Rules 54(d)(1)(B) and 54(e)(1) that the personal representative’s bad faith misuse of estate funds supported the conclusion that her defense of the removal was unreasonable and frivolous, it was not an abuse of discretion for the magistrate to award attorney’s fees to the estate for the removal proceedings. Kolouch v. First Sec. Bank, 128 Idaho 186, 911 P.2d 779 (Ct. App. 1996).

       <p>
        Where the supreme court affirmed the lower court on the contractual issues in a case involving a lease, holding that the lease did not exempt the defendant from liability for fires it negligently caused, the plaintiff was entitled to an award of costs and attorney’s fees pursuant to the terms of the lease.

        Where the cross-claimant failed to specifically argue in any of her briefs that the magistrate erred, where she failed to provide any authority for reversal, and where the court found her cross-claim to be frivolously pursued and without foundation, the recognition by the magistrate that the issue of the award of attorney’s fees was one of discretion supported a finding that there was no abuse of discretion in the awarding of fees against the cross-claimant.

        If the estate itself, as apart from the personal representative of the estate, was to be entitled to an award of attorney’s fees against the surviving spouse, it would be necessary for the estate to establish that the defense by the surviving spouse to an appeal from the order appointing a personal representative was being maintained frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.

        Where a plaintiff wife brought an appeal to a district court from a magistrate’s determination of property issues in a divorce action, the wife’s failure to object to the memorandum of costs filed by the defendant husband in the district court did not constitute a waiver of all objections to the claimed attorney’s fees, because the district judge was sitting as an appellate court in this action and, therefore, the district judge was required to determine the appeal in the same manner and upon the same standards of review as an appeal from the district court to the supreme court; thus, Idaho App. R. 41 governed the procedure for applying for attorney’s fees on appeal.

        Where in an action against a dairy by cattle owners who leased their cattle to the dairy, the cattle owner’s loss was clearly established, but the allocation of liability for the loss turned upon the application of agency principles to complex facts and to an unusual configuration of individual and corporate entities connected with the dairy operation, the defense was not so plainly fallacious as to be frivolous, and the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorney’s fees under this section. Herbst v. Bothof Dairies, Inc., 110 Idaho 971, 719 P.2d 1231 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court improperly exercised its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees where the record failed to show that the judge considered the application of common facts to multiple theories, nor did the record contain a determination as to whether the plaintiffs’ evidence was sufficient to create a fairly debatable issue under the theories advanced. Associates N.W. v. Beets, 112 Idaho 603, 733 P.2d 824 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>

       </p>

        Where the court of appeals was not left with the abiding belief that appeal was frivolously or unreasonably pursued, it would deny respondents request for attorney’s fees on appeal. Bischoff v. Quong-Watkins Properties, 113 Idaho 826, 748 P.2d 410 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>

        In an action brought by the wife to set aside a divorce property settlement agreement, the wife’s appeal was not brought or pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation, and the husband was not entitled to attorney’s fees on appeal.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendants were the prevailing parties in the jury trial, and the action was not defended frivolously or unreasonably, no award of attorney’s fees could be assessed under this section and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) through 54(e)(9) against the defendants, even assuming that the in limine order to prevent reference to the settlement agreement had viability and had only been violated by the defendants. Ross v. Coleman Co., 114 Idaho 817, 761 P.2d 1169 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney’s fees to a defendant in a personal injury action was an abuse of discretion where the court based the award upon consideration of matters that were neither issues in the case nor part of the record. See Severson v. Hermann, 116 Idaho 497, 777 P.2d 269 (1989).
    Hospital was not entitled to attorney’s fees and costs incurred in litigating to determine which of two counties was responsible for medical fees for an indigent patient. IHC Hosps. v. Board of Comm’rs, 117 Idaho 207, 786 P.2d 600 (Ct. App. 1990).

        Where, in case involving question of whether an equity buy-in method of determining connection fees of water and sewer system was reasonable and question whether the collection and use of those fees for replacement of system components constituted a revenue raising method not authorized by law, the district court’s decision in former similar case contained some dicta that inferred that the city’s collection and use of connection fees might be unauthorized and it was clear that this dicta resulted in some confusion for appellants, the case was not brought frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation and award of attorney’s fees was not justified. Loomis v. City of Hailey, 119 Idaho 434, 807 P.2d 1272 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees were improperly awarded where plaintiffs’ attempt to define their rights as the owners of a servient estate, in case regarding property easement was not frivolous nor without basis. Hamilton v. Tax Commission, 119 Idaho 552, 808 P.2d 1297 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        While this section allows fees to be awarded to a prevailing party, the prevailing party must show that the losing party brought, pursued or defended the action frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation; in action seeking to hold third party vicariously liable for plaintiff’s torts theory of joint enterprise, district court did not abuse its discretion in denying an award of fees at trial where district judge stated that he believed the joint enterprise theory of recovery “was incorrect but arguable,” and that he was “not able to say that this case was frivolous or that it was not in good faith.” Maselli v. Ginner, 119 Idaho 702, 809 P.2d 1181 (Ct. App. 1991).

       </p>
       <p>
        Judge, in making award of fees to defendants, improperly relied upon another judge’s instruction that the defendants submit an affidavit for their costs and fees since the directive was not an implicit “finding” that plaintiff’s action was brought or pursued unreasonably or without foundation, and since Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(2) requires a written finding stating the basis and reasons for awarding attorney’s fees, and the defendants did not point to anything in the record of the trial court that satisfied this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal was not frivolous or unreasonable in light of the lack of authority regarding the standards an Idaho court should apply in deciding a motion to set aside the entry of default under Idaho R. Civ. P. 55(c); therefore, no attorney’s fees were awarded on appeal. McFarland v. Curtis, 123 Idaho 931, 854 P.2d 274 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the language of federal law regulating individual retirement accounts and case law precedents raised issue of law as to whether such federal law preempted Idaho community property law, appeal was not frivolous and attorney’s fees would not be awarded on appeal.

        Since an award under this section may only be made if the appellate court finds that the appeal was entirely frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation, where plaintiff raised a legitimate issue with respect to the amount of attorney’s fees awarded by the district court and obtained relief on appeal with respect to that award, the appeal was not frivolous or unreasonable in its entirety, and thus no fees could be awarded under this section.

        In action concerning selection of site for landfill, trial court should not have awarded landowners attorney’s fees on the issue of whether the county failed to provide a method of referendum and/or initiative on the issue, since Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) provides that attorney’s fees can only be awarded under this section where the court finds that the action was brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation and the district court did not make such finding and in fact the county did not defend against such claim but admitted it had failed to provide a method of initiative and/or referendum. Petersen v. Franklin County, 130 Idaho 176, 938 P.2d 1214 (1997).
    As the defendants prevailed on the summary judgment issue on appeal costs were awarded pursuant to Idaho App. R. 40, but the court declined to award attorney’s fees under this section because although the plaintiff’s argument urging error in the grant of summary judgment as to these particular defendants was not persuasive, it was not unreasonable or frivolous.

       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant’s argument, that it should be awarded attorney’s fees because the plaintiff’s theory of causation was unreasonable and unfounded because they called no experts at trial and based their entire suit on the testimony of one witness, was erroneous and the trial court’s refusal to award fees was proper. Lanham v. Idaho Power Co., 130 Idaho 486, 943 P.2d 912 (1997).

        Where landowners appealed from a judgment awarding damages to an irrigation district on their complaint alleging negligence, interference with an easement, and negligence per se for excavation by the landowners that compromised the district’s water irrigation ditch and the district cross-appealed the denial of treble damages, attorney’s fees were denied to both parties because the position of each on appeal was neither brought nor defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation.

        In an appeal of a trial court’s decision that granted plaintiff property owners a prescriptive easement over and through defendant property owners’ parcel to access federal lands, neither side was entitled to attorney’s fees under this section, because the appeal raised important issues and was not brought or defended frivolously or without foundation.

        Where two drivers collided at an uncontrolled intersection, plaintiff driver was not entitled to recover personal injury damages from defendant driver because each driver was 50 percent negligent for failing to keep a proper lookout, and defendant was not entitled to attorney’s fees on appeal; further, plaintiff’s appeal, though unsuccessful, was not frivolous or unreasonable. Vaughn v. Porter, 140 Idaho 470, 95 P.3d 88 (Ct. App. 2004).

       </p>
       <p>
        Award of attorney’s fees by the district court to neighboring property owners, who owned a servient estate, was not appropriate, as the neighboring property owners were not the prevailing parties in an easement dispute, and, further, neither the property owners nor the neighboring property owners were entitled to attorney’s fees on appeal, as the appeal was not frivolous.

    Where a case involved a novel legal question, attorney’s fees should not be granted under this section; the case by respondents and the developers involved novel issues, including a matter of first impression, namely, whether a non-party had standing to challenge an order confirming an arbitration award under Idaho R. Civ. P. 60(b); therefore, attorney’s fees were properly not granted. Campbell v. Kildew, 141 Idaho 640, 115 P.3d 731 (2005).
       </p>

        This section permitted an award of attorney’s fees in a civil action to the prevailing party if the court determined the case was brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation; the employer’s arguments, although unconvincing, were not frivolous, such that no attorney’s fees were awarded to the employee. Dominguez v. Evergreen Res., Inc., 142 Idaho 7, 121 P.3d 938 (2005).

       <p>
        District court erred by awarding attorney’s fees to the wife on intermediate appeal, because the magistrate’s award of attorney’s fees, which was affirmed by the district court, represented an abuse of its discretion when the husband’s child custody claim was not frivolous. Lieurance-Ross v. Ross, 142 Idaho 536, 129 P.3d 1285 (Ct. App. 2006).

       <p>
        After determining that the State of Idaho DOT properly denied plaintiff’s application to renew his driver’s license for failing to provide his social security number, an appellate court declined to award the state attorney’s fees because the state conceded that plaintiff’s religious beliefs and motivations were sincere.

        Where a city did not prevail in a declaratory judgment action against several presenters regarding a proposed marijuana initiative, it was not entitled to attorney’s fees; moreover, the presenters were not entitled to such fees on appeal either because the appeal had a reasonable basis since a pivotal case on the issue had not yet been decided.

        Award of attorneys’ fees was not warranted with respect to dismissal of a third-party complaint in a bankruptcy case, because the nature of the matter presented was based on federal law, which meant that this state’s attorneys’ fees provisions would not apply. Reynard v. Karass (In re Saito Bros.), 560 B.R. 540 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2016). — Award Proper.

        Where third-party defendant offered no defense, called no witnesses, presented no supported legal argument in favor of its position, and it did not vigorously cross-examine any of the witnesses called by other parties in an attempt to support its defense, an award of attorney’s fees under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-120" target="_self">§ 12-120</a></cite>(2), this section, and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e) was proper. Del Milam &amp; Sons v. Bailey, 107 Idaho 587, 691 P.2d 1202 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, which applies generally to any civil appeal, attorney’s fees will be awarded if the court is left with an abiding belief that the appeal was brought frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation; where both magistrate and district judge found that husband failed to establish the necessary elements for relief, his appeal was brought without foundation and wife was entitled to a reasonable attorney’s fee award. Simonovich v. Simonovich, 110 Idaho 9, 713 P.2d 445 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the promissory note stated that the holder of the note would be entitled to collect attorney’s fees if suit were brought to collect the note, the obligees under a deed of trust were entitled to the award of such fees after foreclosure of the deed of trust and trustee’s sale. Farber v. Howell, 111 Idaho 132, 721 P.2d 731 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>

        The trial court did not err in awarding attorney’s fees to the defendant at trial pursuant to this section, where the trial court specifically found that the plaintiff initiated the lawsuit without any foundation for its claim. Sunshine Mining Co. v. Metropolitan Mines Corp., 111 Idaho 654, 726 P.2d 766 (1986).
       </p>

        Where the plaintiff’s appeal of her dismissal for failure to prosecute did not raise a genuine issue as to the legal standards governing the district judge’s discretion, nor did it present a cogent challenge to the judge’s reasoning powers in exercising that discretion, the appeal was brought without foundation, and the defendants were entitled to a reasonable award of attorney’s fees. Nagel v. Wagers, 111 Idaho 822, 727 P.2d 1250 (Ct. App. 1986), disapproved as stated in Aberdeen-Springfield Canal Co. v. Peiper, 133 Idaho 82, 982 P.2d 917 (1999).

        Landowner who brought an action against the sublessee, seed supplier, and tenant farmers to recover the value of its share of wheat harvested from landowner’s property by the tenant farmers, was entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees on appeal, to be determined by the trial court pursuant to Idaho App. R. 41, where the arguments forwarded by the seed supplier, although apparently sincere, were substantially without merit. NBC Leasing Co. v. R & T Farms, Inc., 114 Idaho 141, 754 P.2d 454 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge did not err by deciding to award fees under this section without reviewing a transcript of the trial since sufficient facts were presented to the judge upon which he could determine that the action had been “pursued unreasonably” or “without foundation,” where the judge examined the entire district court file, where he considered the various legal theories advanced by plaintiff and the extent of discovery undertaken by the parties, and where the judge had court minutes of the trial and other documents. Bonaparte v. Neff, 116 Idaho 60, 773 P.2d 1147 (Ct. App. 1989).
    An award under this section is appropriate where an appeal presents no meaningful issue on a question of law but simply invites the appellate court to second-guess the trial judge on conflicting evidence. In such a case a reasonable attorney fee, to be determined under Idaho App. R. 41, may be awarded. Knowlton v. Mudd, 116 Idaho 262, 775 P.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1989).

       <p>
        A boundary dispute in which defendant’s conduct was held to have been outrageous, ill-founded and unreasonable was an appropriate case to award attorney’s fees. See Skelton v. Haney, 116 Idaho 511, 777 P.2d 733 (1989).

        Where the trial court found that plaintiffs’ theory as to the source of a fire and the defendant’s responsibility was unreasonable and unfounded, based on (1) the improbability or inconsistency of the testimony of some of the plaintiffs’ witnesses, (2) evidence that the fire started before the condition the plaintiffs contended was the cause of the fire occurred, and (3) the inconsistency of the physical evidence with the cause advanced by the plaintiffs, and where these findings were supported by the record the award of attorney’s fees pursuant to this section and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) was proper. Sun Valley Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Idaho Power Co., 119 Idaho 87, 803 P.2d 993 (1991).

       </p>
       <p>
        Because plaintiff’s quiet title action was involuntarily dismissed, he was clearly a nonprevailing party. The district court awarded costs and attorney’s fees incurred by the defendant landowners to the extent the costs and attorney’s fees were incurred in preparing a defense against plaintiff’s claim of prescriptive easement. The district court reached its conclusion through the exercise of reason and did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs and attorney’s fees to the defendant landowners. Bonaparte v. Neff, 122 Idaho 714, 838 P.2d 317 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the appeal was taken and pursued frivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation, and where the lease and option to purchase at issue provided for an award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in any action for enforcement, attorney’s fees in addition to costs were awarded on appeal. Clear Springs Trout Co. v. Anthony, 123 Idaho 141, 845 P.2d 559 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where party had agreed in promissory note to pay all costs incurred in collecting the sums due, including attorney’s fees on appeal, and where the appeal merely presented an invitation to second-guess the trial court on conflicting evidence and issues not raised below, an award of attorney’s fees to the opposing party was appropriate. Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Ctr., Inc. v. Krueger, 124 Idaho 501, 861 P.2d 71 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that an arbitrator’s interpretation of a prior case is unsatisfactory to a party is not, of itself, a valid basis for appeal; thus, where the nonprevailing party presented no cogent argument as to why settled law did not apply, the appeal was pursued frivolously and without foundation and attorney, prevailing in professional malpractice case, was entitled to attorney’s fees. Chicoine v. Bignall, 127 Idaho 225, 899 P.2d 438 (1995).
       </p>

        A district judge’s award of fees was affirmed where he perceived the issue as one of discretion, correctly set out and applied the standard for such an award, and reached his decision by an exercise of reason. Bingham v. Montane Resource Assocs., 133 Idaho 420, 987 P.2d 1035 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiffs filed prescriptive easement suit after only two years, and they were on notice of the deficiency in their case, attorney’s fees were properly awarded after defendant’s prevailed in the action. Anderson v. Larsen, 136 Idaho 402, 34 P.3d 1085 (2001).
    An award of attorney’s fees on appeal pursuant to this section is proper only where the state’s supreme court is left with the abiding belief that the appeal was brought or pursued frivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation.

        Award of attorney’s fees under this section was proper where defendant’s counterclaim and defense to the original action were frivolous, and where the appeal pursued was without foundation. Nicholls v. Blaser, 102 Idaho 559, 633 P.2d 1137 (1981).

       <p>
        Where a dispassionate view of the record disclosed that there was no valid reason to anticipate reversal of the lower court’s judgment on the factual grounds urged, the record contained abundant evidence supporting the determination of the judge and jury, and the arguments and authorities advanced in support of the two legal issues presented on appeal failed to establish how the discretionary decisions of the district court not to bifurcate the issues involved in the trial or to act upon the motion for a view arose to the level of error, costs and attorney’s fees would be awarded to the appellees. Rueth v. State, 103 Idaho 74, 644 P.2d 1333 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an appeal presented no meaningful issue on a question of law and, in regard to the trial court’s findings, the appellant was unable to do more than dispute minor details and point to conflicts in the evidence, the appellate court was left with the abiding belief that the appeal was brought without foundation, and, thus, the prevailing appellee was entitled to an award of a reasonable attorney fee on appeal. T-Craft Aero Club, Inc. v. Blough, 102 Idaho 833, 642 P.2d 70 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where appeal lacked any significant legal question and the claim involved was of minimal value, the appeal was frivolous and unreasonably pursued, and attorney’s fees would be awarded to the respondent. Huff v. Uhl, 103 Idaho 274, 647 P.2d 730 (1982).
       </p>

        An award of attorney’s fees on appeal is appropriate when appellate court is left with the abiding belief that an appeal has been brought or defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. Barlow’s, Inc. v. Bannock Cleaning Corp., 103 Idaho 310, 647 P.2d 766 (Ct. App. 1982).

        The decision in
    Minich v. Gem State Developers, Inc.
    , 99 Idaho 911, 591 P.2d 1078 (1979), narrows the circumstances under which attorney’s fees can be awarded on appeal, under this section, even to a litigant who has successfully acted as a private attorney general. Neilsen & Co. v. Cassia & Twin Falls County Joint Class A School Dist. 151, 103 Idaho 317, 647 P.2d 773 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney’s fees on appeal will not be made where a decision is based upon legal authorities from other jurisdictions, and the appeal has helped to develop Idaho case law on the subject; thus, where a lawsuit was characterized by an interface of assignment law with the legal and ethical duties created by the attorney-client relationship, where it generated issues of first impression in Idaho, and where the court of appeals relied largely upon authorities from other jurisdictions to reach, and to support, its decision, no attorney’s fees would be awarded on appeal. Bonanza Motors, Inc. v. Webb, 104 Idaho 234, 657 P.2d 1102 (Ct. App. 1983).

        Contention that<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c91s6-918A" target="_blank">§ 6-918A</a></cite>, when viewed in contrast to this section, discriminates impermissibly against those tort plaintiffs whose claims lie against a governmental entity rather than against private parties would not be addressed by court where attorney’s fees in particular case could not have been awarded under either statute because of failure to show that case was defended frivolously or without foundation. Packard v. Joint Sch. Dist. No. 171, 104 Idaho 604, 661 P.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1983).
    One party’s failure to negotiate does not, by itself, establish the opposing party’s right to attorney’s fees under this section; an award of fees must be supported by a finding that one or more of the criteria prescribed by Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) have been satisfied. Bosshardt v. Taylor, 104 Idaho 660, 662 P.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial judge observed that no meaningful negotiations to settle case had been entered into between the parties, but expressly declined to find that defendants had defended the case frivolously or in bad faith, the absence of such a finding required reversal of the award of attorney’s fees which had been based on judge’s desire to make plaintiff “whole.” Bosshardt v. Taylor, 104 Idaho 660, 662 P.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is permissive, not mandatory and it contains no subject matter limitation; it may be applied even if the appeal focuses not upon the subject of the underlying litigation but solely upon an award of attorney’s fees below. DeWils Interiors, Inc. v. Dines, 106 Idaho 288, 678 P.2d 80 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A misperception of law or of one’s interest under the law is not, by itself, unreasonable conduct; if it were, virtually every case controlled by a question of law would entail an attorney fee award against the losing party under this section. Rather, the question must be whether the position adopted by the losing party was not only incorrect but so plainly fallacious that it could be deemed frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation. Wing v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 106 Idaho 905, 684 P.2d 307 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court, in awarding attorney’s fees pursuant to this section, failed to find that the case was defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation and failed to make a written finding as to the basis and reasons for awarding attorney’s fees, such award was vacated. Kerr Land & Livestock, Inc. v. Glaus, 107 Idaho 767, 692 P.2d 1199 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an order awarding attorney’s fees is correct, but has been entered upon an erroneous theory, it will be upheld upon the proper theory. Camp v. Jiminez, 107 Idaho 878, 693 P.2d 1080 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim is not necessarily frivolous or lacking in merit simply because it ultimately fails as a matter of law; rather, the question is whether the claim, when made and pursued, is so plainly fallacious that it can be termed frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation. Gulf Chem. Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Williams, 107 Idaho 890, 693 P.2d 1092 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the material facts in the case were not disputed, where the court was not confronted with a choice between reasonable inferences but rather was asked to draw inferences upon facts not shown in the record and the law governing the case was well settled, attorney’s fees were awarded. Lind v. Perkins, 107 Idaho 901, 693 P.2d 1103 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award under this section will not be made unless the appellate court is left with the abiding belief that the appeal was brought or pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Rudy-Mai Farms v. Peterson, 109 Idaho 116, 705 P.2d 1071 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees are awardable if an appeal does no more than simply invite the appellate court to second-guess the trial court on conflicting evidence, or if the law is well settled and the appellants have made no substantial showing that the district court misapplied the law, or if the appeal has been frivolous, unreasonable or lacking in foundation. Davis v. Gage, 109 Idaho 1029, 712 P.2d 730 (Ct. App. 1985).
    The standard for determining whether an award under this section should be made is not whether the position urged by the nonprevailing party is ultimately found to be wrong, but whether it is so plainly fallacious as to be frivolous. Herbst v. Bothof Dairies, Inc., 110 Idaho 971, 719 P.2d 1231 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney’s fees is only proper when an action was either brought or defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. Soria v. Sierra Pac. Airlines, 111 Idaho 594, 726 P.2d 706 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney’s fees under this section is discretionary; but it must be supported by findings and those findings, in turn, must be supported by the record. Sunshine Mining Co. v. Metropolitan Mines Corp., 111 Idaho 654, 726 P.2d 766 (1986).
       </p>

        An award under this section will be made if the appellate court is left with the abiding belief that the appeal was brought or pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Nagel v. Wagers, 111 Idaho 822, 727 P.2d 1250 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was inappropriate to award attorney’s fees under this section solely on the basis of pleading “alternative and contradictory facts”. Murr v. Odmark, 112 Idaho 606, 733 P.2d 827 (Ct. App. 1987).

        Attorney’s fees are awardable if an appeal does no more than simply invite an appellate court to second-guess the trial court on conflicting evidence, or if the law is well settled and appellant has made no substantial showing that the district court misapplied the law.

        Where, in an action brought by dissenting shareholders demanding payment for their shares at fair value, the corporation’s appeal was not brought frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation, attorney’s fees were not awarded under this section. Waters v. Double L, Inc., 114 Idaho 256, 755 P.2d 1294 (Ct. App. 1987), aff’d, 115 Idaho 705, 769 P.2d 582 (1989).

        Attorney’s fees will be awarded only when the appeal was brought, pursued, or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Hales v. King, 114 Idaho 916, 762 P.2d 829 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees are permitted if the appeal was brought, pursued, or defended unreasonably or without foundation; a defense is not frivolous or groundless merely because the respondent loses. Lowery v. Board of County Comm’rs, 115 Idaho 64, 764 P.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees should not be apportioned based upon prevailing theories of recovery, but rather should be awarded based upon application of appropriate standards and factors. Bubak v. Evans, 117 Idaho 510, 788 P.2d 1333 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of a prevailing party involves a three-part inquiry; the court must examine (1) the result obtained in relation to the relief sought; (2) whether there were multiple claims or issues; and (3) the extent to which either party prevailed on each issue or claim. Jerry J. Joseph C.L.U. Ins. Assocs. v. Vaught, 117 Idaho 555, 789 P.2d 1146 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where district court awarded attorney’s fees but did not articulate the reasons for the award, since in general, attorney’s fees will not be awarded on appeal under this section unless the appellate court is left with the abiding belief that the appeal was brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation, the issue of attorney’s fees would be remanded to the district court so that it might state its reasons under
    Minich v. Gem State Developers, Inc.
    , 99 Idaho 911, 591 P.2d 1078 (1979) for the award. Blanc v. Laritz, 119 Idaho 359, 806 P.2d 452 (Ct. App. 1991).
    Request for attorney’s fees in action on Idaho R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion alleging mistake in property settlement agreement would be resolved by such agreement which provided that absent a breach of the agreement, each party shall assume and pay their own costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees in connection with this action where neither party alleged that the agreement was breached. Thomas v. Thomas, 119 Idaho 709, 809 P.2d 1188 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court’s consideration of failed settlement negotiations or of a refusal to negotiate a settlement when deciding whether to award attorney’s fees is prohibited under Idaho law. Smith v. Angell, 122 Idaho 25, 830 P.2d 1163 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees under this section may only be awarded by the court when it finds that the case was brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Hossner v. Idaho Forest Indus., Inc., 122 Idaho 413, 835 P.2d 648 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that neither party prevailed, that the city had not acted frivolously, and that plaintiff was not entitled to costs and attorney’s fees, where plaintiff attempted to prevent city from leasing a former hospital to the state for use as a correctional facility. Foster v. City of St. Anthony, 122 Idaho 883, 841 P.2d 413 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because an appeal to the district court under the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act does not constitute a “civil action” as defined by Idaho R. Civ. P. 3(a), attorney’s fees were not available under this section to county which had its denial of reimbursement to hospital for medical indigency benefits upheld on appeal. University of Utah Hosp. v. Board of Comm’rs, 128 Idaho 529, 915 P.2d 1387 (Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiffs’ requested attorney’s fees resulting from the defense of appeal, arguing that the appeal was frivolous, presented no bona fide arguments and advanced no authority, but they did not identify any particular conduct or arguments that they deemed frivolous or unmeritorious, and, on the contrary, the defendants asserted issues that deserved determination on appeal. Thus, there was no basis for an award of attorney’s fees to the plaintiffs. Hughes v. State, Dep’t of Law Enforcement, 129 Idaho 558, 929 P.2d 120 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion where the record showed that he maintained that the easement accorded him carte blanche to make such changes in the existing road as he saw fit and where the district court concluded that his position was so plainly fallacious and violative of the rights of the servient landowners that an award of fees to the respondents as the prevailing parties in the action was justified. Conley v. Whittlesey, 133 Idaho 265, 985 P.2d 1127 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly awarded respondents attorney’s fees because it found plaintiff’s petition to be frivolous, unreasonable and without foundation, in claiming a violation of nonexistent constitutional and statutory rights. Ackerman v. Bonneville County, 140 Idaho 307, 92 P.3d 557 (Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a party has asserted claims that are frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, the presence of a legitimate, triable issue of fact is not a complete bar to the assessment of attorney fees. Apportionment of attorney fees is appropriate for those elements of the case that were frivolous, unreasonable, and without foundation. Idaho Military Historical Soc’y, Inc. v. Maslen, 156 Idaho 624, 329 P.3d 1072 (2014).

Elliott v. Darwin Neibaur Farms, 138 Idaho 774, 69 P.3d 1035, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1004, 124 S. Ct. 535, 157 L. Ed. 2d 410 (2003).
    In action involving a contract dispute which arose from a remodeling project that plaintiffs performed for defendants where it was evident based on the record and the arguments made on appeal that court could not say that the appeal was brought frivolously or unreasonably or that it lacked foundation, no attorney’s fees were appropriate on appeal. Baker v. Boren, 129 Idaho 885, 934 P.2d 951 (Ct. App. 1997).

        An appeal of the grant of summary judgment on the issue of an implied easement was not entirely frivolous or without merit as the trial court had not yet decided the issue of whether an implied easement by prior use could be extinguished if use of the disputed way was no longer reasonably necessary. Therefore, attorney’s fees were denied. Davis v. Peacock, 133 Idaho 637, 991 P.2d 362 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1078, 120 S. Ct. 1697, 146 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2000).

        Property owners were not entitled to attorney’s fees in the appeal of a summary judgment granted for them in an easement dispute. It was apparent from their briefs that the property owners’ neighbors believed that the property owners’ parcel would not be subdivided and would always remain a single lot; although this argument was not persuasive in light of relevant easement law and the wording of the easement agreement, it was not frivolous.

        Grant of summary judgment in favor of the company was proper where the company did not enter into any agreement or make any representation to pay the wife her community property interest in the husband’s shares in the event of divorce; further, the district court did not err in denying the company an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to this section because the language of the agreements was such that the wife’s arguments did not rise to the level of frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. Tolley v. THI Co., 140 Idaho 253, 92 P.3d 503 (2004).

       <p>
        In a subrogation case, a court did not err by denying attorney’s fees to plaintiffs where, at the time of the lawsuit the law was not settled whether an insurer would be required to pay a proportionate share of costs and attorney’s fees when the insurer did not consent to the insured taking action to collect the insurer’s claim, it was only after an applicable case was decided that plaintiffs amended their complaint seeking recovery under the common fund doctrine for punitive damages, and the trial court concluded that under the circumstances, it could not say that the insurer’s defense of the law suit was frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation. Boll v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 140 Idaho 334, 92 P.3d 1081 (2004).

        In condemnation proceeding, where landowners were entitled to award of attorney’s fees only if they could show entitlement under this section: trial judge did not err in finding that case was not pursued frivolously or unreasonably, as required by Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), so as to warrant award of attorney’s fees. State ex rel. Moore v. Lawson, 105 Idaho 164, 667 P.2d 267 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of reasonable attorney’s fees to the condemnee in an eminent domain proceeding is a matter for the trial court’s guided discretion and, as in other areas of the law, such award will be overturned only upon a showing of abuse. Ada County Hwy. Dist. ex rel. Fairbanks v. Acarrequi, 105 Idaho 873, 673 P.2d 1067 (1983), overruled on other grounds, State v. Grathol, — Idaho —, 343 P.3d 480 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees and costs are allowable, in eminent domain proceedings, under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1); however, such fees and costs are not mandatory as within the definition of just compensation. Ada County Hwy. Dist. ex rel. Fairbanks v. Acarrequi, 105 Idaho 873, 673 P.2d 1067 (1983), overruled on other grounds, State v. Grathol, — Idaho —, 343 P.3d 480 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In condemnation actions, attorney’s fees may be awarded to the condemnee without a showing and finding that the action was brought and pursued “frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.” Ada County Hwy. Dist. ex rel. Fairbanks v. Acarrequi, 105 Idaho 873, 673 P.2d 1067 (1983), overruled on other grounds, State v. Grathol, — Idaho —, 343 P.3d 480 (2015).

       <p>
        Attorney’s fees and other expenses are not recoverable in a condemnation proceeding, except as authorized by statute. Ada County Hwy. Dist. ex rel. Fairbanks v. Acarrequi, 105 Idaho 873, 673 P.2d 1067 (1983), overruled on other grounds, State v. Grathol, — Idaho —, 343 P.3d 480 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining award of attorney’s fees to a condemnee, the court should consider the following factors: whether the condemnor reasonably made a timely offer of settlement of at least 90 percent of the ultimate jury verdict and whether such offer was made within a reasonable period after the institution of the action; any controverting of the public use and necessity allegations; the outcome of any hearing thereon and any modification in the plans or design of the condemnor’s project resulting from the condemnee’s challenge; and whether the condemnee voluntarily granted possession of the property pending resolution of the just compensation issue. As to the amount of attorney’s fees awardable, the criteria outlined in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3) are appropriate in condemnation, as in all other civil cases; however, the court should not automatically adopt any contingent fee or contractual arrangement, but rather the fee awarded may be more or less than that provided in the lawyer-client contract. Ada County Hwy. Dist. ex rel. Fairbanks v. Acarrequi, 105 Idaho 873, 673 P.2d 1067 (1983), overruled on other grounds, State v. Grathol, — Idaho —, 343 P.3d 480 (2015).

        When a contract is clear and unambiguous, the reviewing court uses the plain meaning of the words, not the intent of the parties. Thus, where city, as third-party beneficiary, did not demonstrate than any terms of the sublease were ambiguous and, as such, had failed to establish that there was a genuine issue of fact which would have made district court’s summary judgment award improper, city’s appeal was without foundation and respondent was entitled to an award of attorney’s fees on appeal.

        Where neither a plaintiff nor a defendant was a prevailing party since both achieved partial success, but a co-defendant received nearly all of the relief sought, no award of fees to the co-defendant was warranted since there was no showing of the fees incurred solely on behalf of the co-defendant.

Futrell v. Martin, 100 Idaho 473, 600 P.2d 777 (1979).
    Where trial court made no finding as to the time allocated to defending homeowners against claim by real estate broker but, rather, based its determination on what had been awarded to potential purchasers when they prevailed in dismissal of the third-party complaint by homeowners against them, the trial court failed to properly take into consideration the factors enumerated in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3) and case must be remanded for redetermination of amount of attorney’s fees. Logosz v. Childers, 105 Idaho 173, 667 P.2d 276 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The introduction of hourly time sheets into evidence is not a prerequisite to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees; however, an award of attorney’s fees must be supported by findings which must, in turn, be supported by the record.

    Where, as a grounds for providing it with attorney’s fees, a bank argued that a customer’s suit was “frivolous,” but where the lower court paid much attention to the fact that the customer appeared pro se and it could have properly concluded that he believed his suit was not “frivolous,” the lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney’s fees to the bank. Palmer v. Idaho Bank & Trust, 100 Idaho 642, 603 P.2d 597 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no showing that the $300 attorney fee award made in a suit to recover on claim against estate constituted an abuse of the district court’s discretion, the award to the estate was affirmed. Tanner v. Estate of Cobb, 101 Idaho 444, 614 P.2d 984 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state department of health and welfare failed to demonstrate, and the record did not reveal, that the district court abused its discretion when it denied an award of attorney’s fees to the department on an appeal from a hearing officer’s administrative decision which affirmed the termination of the recipients’ public assistance grants, the district court’s denial of attorney’s fees would not be disturbed. Tappen v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 102 Idaho 807, 641 P.2d 994 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the advent of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), this section, standing alone, gave the trial court broad discretion to award attorney’s fees to prevailing parties; therefore, where in an unlawful detainer action filed before the effective date of the rule, both parties partially prevailed, but one party prevailed on all the issues except one, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to that party. Haskin v. Glass, 102 Idaho 785, 640 P.2d 1186 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The award of attorney’s fees rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and the burden is on the person disputing the award to show an abuse of discretion. Anderson v. Ethington, 103 Idaho 658, 651 P.2d 923 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a genuine issue may appear on the face of the pleadings and affidavits, it does not necessarily follow that the evidence introduced at trial sustains that position; accordingly, where, at the end of the trial, the court concluded that a third-party complaint was without reasonable foundation, the fact that it had previously found for the party on summary judgment did not necessarily establish that the complaint was reasonable and well founded, and the award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party was not an abuse of discretion. Anderson v. Ethington, 103 Idaho 658, 651 P.2d 923 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no clear showing that the trial judge abused or failed to exercise his discretion in awarding attorney’s fees, the awards would not be set aside, and the assertion that a small portion of the trial court’s decision indicated a failure to exercise discretion was untenable in light of the remainder of the decision wherein the trial court reviewed all objections to the claimed costs and attorney’s fees and, clearly utilizing his discretion, disallowed some costs and substantially reduced the claimed attorney’s fees. City of Nampa v. McGee, 104 Idaho 63, 656 P.2d 124 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In those instances wherein attorney’s fees can properly be awarded, the award of attorney’s fees rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and the burden is on the person disputing the award to show an abuse of discretion. Hellar v. Cenarrusa, 106 Idaho 571, 682 P.2d 524 (1984).
    An award of attorney’s fees under this section is discretionary; but it must be supported by findings and those findings, in turn, must be supported by the record. Wing v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 106 Idaho 905, 684 P.2d 307 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A district court’s determination when awarding attorney’s fees that an action was frivolously defended will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion; however, the district court must consider all relevant factors in exercising its sound discretion. Camp v. Jiminez, 107 Idaho 878, 693 P.2d 1080 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney’s fees under this section rests within the sound discretion of the district judge, but when a fairly debatable claim is deemed frivolous for no stated reason other than its ultimate failure upon a point of law, discretion has been abused. Gulf Chem. Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Williams, 107 Idaho 890, 693 P.2d 1092 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) only applies to actions filed after March 1, 1979; thus, where the action was filed well before Rule 54(e) became effective, the trial court incorrectly assumed that he was bound by the rule, when in fact his exercise of discretion in considering an award of fees under this section was not subject to the limitations of that rule. Due to the trial judge’s erroneous assumption, attorney’s fees were denied on improper grounds. Pichon v. L.J. Broekemeier, Inc., 108 Idaho 846, 702 P.2d 884 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Objections to the memorandum of costs must be made within ten days of its service under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(6); however, a failure to timely object does not automatically entitle the prevailing party to the attorney’s fees requested. An award of attorney’s fees under this section is discretionary with the trial court; lack of an objection does not preclude the court from exercising its discretion in deciding whether to award attorney’s fees under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1)(D). Long v. Hendricks, 109 Idaho 73, 705 P.2d 78 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court did not abuse its discretion in not awarding attorney’s fees in view of the large damage claims against the defendant and the complexity of the case. Soria v. Sierra Pac. Airlines, 111 Idaho 594, 726 P.2d 706 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination to award or not award attorney’s fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court. Soria v. Sierra Pac. Airlines, 111 Idaho 594, 726 P.2d 706 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where issues of discretion are involved, an award of attorney’s fees is proper if the appellant fails to make a cogent challenge to the judge’s exercise of discretion. Andrews v. Idaho Forest Indus., Inc., 117 Idaho 195, 786 P.2d 586 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the court was not left with the abiding belief that an appeal was pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation, an award of attorney’s fees was properly withheld from the prevailing party in an action which sought to set aside a stipulated settlement. Artiach Trucking, Inc. v. Wolters, 118 Idaho 656, 798 P.2d 938 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court abused its discretion in holding a defendant equally liable with codefendant for costs and fees in a quiet title action where plaintiff named defendant as a defendant without alleging any acts of wrongdoing on her part and the plaintiff had stipulated to dismissal of the defendant prior to trial without making any claim against her for costs or fees. Platt v. Brown, 120 Idaho 41, 813 P.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an exercise of discretion is involved, an appellate court conducts a three-step analysis: (1) whether the trial court properly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether that court acted within the outer boundaries of such discretion and consistently with any legal standards applicable to specific choices; and (3) whether the court reached its decision by the exercise of reason. Savage Lateral Ditch Water Users Ass’n v. Pulley, 125 Idaho 237, 869 P.2d 554 (1994).
    Where the district court perceived that the awarding of attorney’s fees under this section was discretionary, and where the court acted within the boundaries of its discretion, reaching its decision to deny fees by an exercise of reason, the denial was affirmed. Treasure Valley Concrete, Inc. v. State, 132 Idaho 673, 978 P.2d 233 (1999), overruled on other grounds, City of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 277 P.3d 353 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the record did not establish that the district court applied the standards set forth in
    Sun Valley Shopping Center v. Idaho Power Co.,
    119 Idaho 87, 803 P.2d 993, (1991) in exercising its discretion to award attorney’s fees, the case was remanded for the district court to consider the claim for attorney’s fees and to specify the basis of any award or denial of an award. Simons v. Simons, 134 Idaho 824, 11 P.3d 20 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Awarding of attorney’s fees and costs under this section, and Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) and 54(d)(1) is within the discretion of the trial court and subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review; the burden is on the party disputing the award of attorney’s fees to show an abuse of discretion. Burns v. Baldwin, 138 Idaho 480, 65 P.3d 502 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant’s request for attorney’s fees under this section was denied even though the claimant was the prevailing party, because the trial court properly exercised its discretion consistent with the appropriate legal standards and reached the decision to deny attorney’s fees based upon the exercise of reason. Roark v. Bentley, 139 Idaho 793, 86 P.3d 507 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the parent attorney’s fees because the issue of whether the charter school could maintain an action for libel and slander was a debatable issue; the district judge had broad discretion to apportion the attorney’s fees the parent claimed, and no abuse of that discretion occurred. Nampa Charter Sch., Inc. v. Delapaz, 140 Idaho 23, 89 P.3d 863 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award under this statute is not a matter of right to the prevailing party, but is appropriate only when the court, in its discretion, is left with the abiding belief that the case was brought, pursued, or defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. Kilborn v. Haun (In re Haun), 396 B.R. 522 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney fees under this section is discretionary, but it must be supported by findings; and those findings, in turn, must be supported by the record. Westover v. Idaho Counties Risk Mgmt. Program, 164 Idaho 385, 430 P.3d 1284 (2018).

        Where a wife’s appeal of a divorce decree was unavailing, but was not frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation, the district judge abused his discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to husband under this section. Hentges v. Hentges, 115 Idaho 192, 765 P.2d 1094 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>

        Where the husband’s appeal was driven by his dissatisfaction with the magistrate judge’s factual findings, and he had done little more than invite the appellate court to second-guess the magistrate’s findings, attorney’s fees were appropriately awarded to the wife on appeal. Reed v. Reed, 137 Idaho 53, 44 P.3d 1108 (2002).
    In divorce proceedings, magistrate erred in awarding attorney’s fees to wife on the basis that husband’s child custody claim was frivolous because he was subject to a guardianship and, therefore, was absolutely precluded from seeking custody, because a parent with a guardian is not absolutely precluded from exercising any level of custody of his or her child. Lieurance-Ross v. Ross, 142 Idaho 536, 129 P.3d 1285 (Ct. App. 2006).

        Where an appeal from an order refusing to set aside a default judgment afforded the court of appeals an important occasion to define the standards which should govern appellate review of decisions to grant or to deny relief from default judgments, and the appeal may well have been encouraged by the supreme court’s decisions in several prior cases, the court of appeals would not assess attorney’s fees against the appellant in favor of the respondents who were the prevailing parties. Avondale on Hayden, Inc. v. Hall, 104 Idaho 321, 658 P.2d 992 (Ct. App. 1983).

        No attorney’s fees were awarded in a case that raised issues of first impression to the supreme court regarding whether, pursuant to signature requirements of Idaho R. Civ. P. 11(a)(1), an agent could sign a complaint on behalf of unrepresented parties and where the original complaint was thus signed was it in violation of rule, and where there was no consensus as to how other courts had treated those issues, so the arguments presented were reasonable and not frivolous.

        Where an appeal from an order refusing to set aside a default judgment afforded the court of appeals an important occasion to define the standards which should govern appellate review of decisions to grant or to deny relief from default judgments, and the appeal may well have been encouraged by the supreme court’s decisions in several prior cases, the court of appeals would not assess attorney’s fees against the appellant in favor of the respondents who were the prevailing parties. Avondale on Hayden, Inc. v. Hall, 104 Idaho 321, 658 P.2d 992 (Ct. App. 1983).

        No attorney’s fees were awarded in a case that raised issues of first impression to the supreme court regarding whether, pursuant to signature requirements of Idaho R. Civ. P. 11(a)(1), an agent could sign a complaint on behalf of unrepresented parties and where the original complaint was thus signed was it in violation of rule, and where there was no consensus as to how other courts had treated those issues, so the arguments presented were reasonable and not frivolous. Black v. Ameritel Inns, Inc., 139 Idaho 511, 81 P.3d 416 (2003).

        Where a personal injury action was initiated prior to March 1, 1979, the effective date of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), it was not necessary for the trial court to make the findings presently required by that rule before awarding attorney’s fees under this section. Quincy v. Joint Sch. Dist. No. 41, 102 Idaho 764, 640 P.2d 304 (1981).
    If a prevailing party makes a specific contention that one or more of the criteria of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) through 54(e)(9) have been satisfied, the court should state its reasons for declining to award attorney’s fees. Otherwise, the appellate court has no meaningful basis to review the trial court’s exercise of discretion. First Sec. Bank v. Absco Whse., Inc., 104 Idaho 853, 664 P.2d 281 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings are required under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(2) only when a court awards attorney’s fees pursuant to this section. Devine v. Cluff, 110 Idaho 1, 713 P.2d 437 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The absence of specific findings of fact and conclusions of law providing a basis and reason for awarding attorney’s fees requires a reversal and remand for additional findings and conclusions. Thus, where district court’s findings in instant case did not explain its decision to award attorney’s fees, such reversal and remand was necessary. Snipes v. Schalo, 130 Idaho 890, 950 P.2d 262 (Ct.

        Where the evidence showed that a wife’s appeal to the district court, from a magistrate’s determination of property issues in a divorce action, seriously addressed the then unresolved and genuine issue of the transmutation of her husband’s property from separate to community property, the district judge improperly determined that the husband was entitled to attorney’s fees since the appeal was not brought or pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.

        This section, as interpreted by Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1), is procedural in nature, and, unlike<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t12c01s12-120" target="_self">§ 12-120</a></cite>(2), it does not grant a substantive right for additional relief in specific actions; it deals instead with the inherent right of courts to control, when circumstances demand, vexatious practices before them.

        This section authorizes the court to award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party on appeal, not as a matter of right, but only where the court is left with the abiding belief that the appeal was brought, pursued or defended frivolously or without foundation.

        Attorney’s fees may be awarded pursuant to this section on appeal if the supreme court of Idaho is left with an abiding belief that the appeal was brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation; an award of attorney’s fees is appropriate if the law is well-settled and the appellants have made no substantial showing that the district court misapplied the law.

A claim is not necessarily frivolous simply because the district court concludes it fails as a matter of law.

        Attorney’s fees are to be awarded only where they are authorized by statute or contract. Since this section provides the trial court, with discretion, to award fees to the prevailing party, there is a statutory basis and the question then becomes whether the Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(1) limitation, restricting the award to those cases which are “defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation,” is applicable. Where the award of attorney’s fees is under the private attorney general doctrine, the limitation does not apply. Hellar v. Cenarrusa, 106 Idaho 571, 682 P.2d 524 (1984).

        There is a three-factor test to determine the right to attorney’s fees under the private attorney general doctrine: (1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation; (2) the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff; and (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.

        § 12-122. Attorney’s fees in habeas corpus actions.
       </h3>
       <p>
        In any habeas corpus action brought by a state penitentiary or county jail inmate, the judge shall award reasonable attorney’s fees to the respondent, if, in the judgment of the court, the habeas corpus action was brought frivolously by the petitioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        In all habeas corpus actions which result in a denial or dismissal of a writ of habeas corpus, the court shall make a specific finding whether or not the habeas corpus action was brought frivolously by the petitioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of this section, “brought frivolously,” shall mean that the petitioner petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus based upon claims which either had no basis in fact or, even if the factual allegations were true, they did not, as a matter of law, justify any relief to the petitioner; provided, however, that the court, in its discretion, may determine that the action was not brought frivolously when the action involves a material issue of law that has not been settled by statute or by supreme court decision in this state.

        Defendant’s appeal concerning probation violation charges from another jurisdiction involved material issues of law that had not heretofore been settled by statute or by decision of the Idaho supreme court. Thus, even if this section stood as authority to exercise discretion in determining whether to award attorney fees to the state on appeal, such an award should not have been made under the present facts. Swain v. State, 122 Idaho 918, 841 P.2d 448 (Ct. App. 1992).

        Magistrate and district court erred in awarding costs and attorney fees to respondents, Idaho commission of pardons and parole, commissioners, and hearing officer, as the inmate’s petition may have had some valid points.

        Where defendant inmate brought a writ of habeas corpus petition alleging that his due process rights were violated by the department of correction failure to provide him timely notice and to grant him a timely disciplinary hearing as provided by the department’s manual, defendant failed to show any adverse impact of the delay or any violation of due process; accordingly, magistrate’s award of attorney fees to the state was upheld.

       <p>
        Where questions of law are raised, the nonprevailing party’s position is not automatically frivolous simply because the court is unpersuaded; rather, the test is whether the nonprevailing party’s position is plainly fallacious and, therefore, not fairly debatable; where a magistrate held that a habeas corpus petition was frivolous because it was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, this was error. Werlinger v. State, 117 Idaho 47, 785 P.2d 172 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition for habeas corpus alleging petitioner was denied adequate medical treatment had a basis in fact at the time it was filed where before the petition was filed, petitioner complained that lesion on his leg caused pain, itchiness and discomfort, and he insisted on being examined by a physician; however, it was not until after the petition had been filed that he was able to have the lesion examined by a doctor and petitioner’s request for a second medical opinion did not occur until the close of the evidentiary hearing; prior to that time, he was still seeking medical assistance from the prison’s medical staff; because petitioner did obtain some of the relief which he requested, the petition had a basis in fact at the time it was filed; moreover, since petitioner’s initial request to see a physician may indeed have been justified under the circumstances and his need for a second medical opinion raised a material issue of law that was fairly debatable and which had not yet been settled by supreme court decision in this state, his petition was not brought frivolously and state was not entitled to attorney’s fees. Vannatter v. State, 119 Idaho 507, 808 P.2d 426 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no language in this section prohibiting the state from asserting its claim for fees on appeal independent from a request for attorney fees for defending a frivolous action in the lower court. The determinative question on appeal under this section is not whether the habeas corpus action brought by defendant presented frivolous matters or issues to the magistrate’s court, but whether the subsequent appeal which was taken from the magistrate’s decision was frivolous. Swain v. State, 122 Idaho 918, 841 P.2d 448 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prisoner did not bring the action and appeal frivolously, since the action involved a material issue regarding prison discipline that had not been settled by statute or supreme court decision in Idaho, and the state was denied attorney fees. Schevers v. State, 129 Idaho 573, 930 P.2d 603 (1996).

       After commencement of any civil action based upon a claim for relief arising in tort, from property damage, personal injury or wrongful death, any claimant may at any time, no later than ten (10) days before the trial, serve upon an adverse party, a written offer of settlement, offering to settle his claim in such action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain, including any attorney fees allowable by law and costs of litigation then accrued.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c03s12-301ol1b">
       If the adverse party, at any time after service of such offer of settlement and prior to its revocation, serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance, together with proof of service thereof, and thereupon judgment shall be entered for the amount of the offer. In the event that an offer of settlement is revoked by a claimant or not accepted, evidence of the offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs or to award interest pursuant to this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c03s12-301ol1c">
       If such offer of settlement is not accepted prior to trial pursuant to subsection (b) above, and the action reaches a final judgment by the court after trial, the court shall inquire as to whether any prevailing claimant made an offer of settlement, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, which an adverse party failed to accept. If the court finds that such claimant has recovered an amount equal to or greater than his offer of settlement, the court shall add to the judgment, annual interest on the amount contained in such offer, computed from the date that the offer of settlement was served and shall enter judgment accordingly. For purposes of such computation, the last offer of settlement which was equal to or less than the damages awarded such claimant, together with the costs and attorney fees, if any, awarded to him shall be used. A subsequent offer made pursuant to subsection (a) revokes any previous offer.

        This section is declaratory of equitable rule that where judgment is paid by one collaterally liable as surety, he is subrogated to all rights and liens of creditor with same position of priority occupied by him. Agren v. Staker, 46 Idaho 36, 267 P. 460 (1928).

        The plaintiff to whom a debtor executed a bill of sale of debtor’s property which was subject to two prior liens of a bank, one being secured by a chattel mortgage and the other unsecured, and also taking an assignment of property under an agreement to pay the claims of the bank in full is not on a payment of the chattel mortgage debt entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the bank under the mortgage without paying the unsecured debt of the bank. Houghtelin v. Diehl, 47 Idaho 636, 277 P. 699 (1929).

        Derivation of Right of Subrogation.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The common law is indebted to the civil law for the doctrine of subrogation which was imported into the common-law courts by the aid of courts of equity, and so imported has been considered as a creature of equity and so administered so as to secure real and essential justice without regard to form; and it will not be allowed to operate in any case where so to do would work an injustice to others, as where it would disturb priorities of liens or defeat fixed rights of others. Houghtelin v. Diehl, 47 Idaho 636, 277 P. 699 (1929).

        Doctrine Not Contractual.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The doctrine of subrogation does not rest on contract and no general rule can be laid down which will afford a sure test in all cases for its application; but whether the doctrine is applicable to any particular case depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of such case. Houghtelin v. Diehl, 47 Idaho 636, 277 P. 699 (1929).

       <p>
        “Subrogate” in its broadest sense is substitution of one person for another so that he may succeed to the rights of the creditor in respect to a debt or claim. Houghtelin v. Diehl, 47 Idaho 636, 277 P. 699 (1929).
