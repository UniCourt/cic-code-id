       It is unlawful for any employer to maintain a blacklist, or to notify any other employer that any current or former employee has been blacklisted by such employer, for the purpose of preventing such employee from receiving employment.

       An employer who in good faith provides information about the job performance, professional conduct, or evaluation of a former or current employee to a prospective employer of that employee, at the request of the prospective employer of that employee, or at the request of the current or former employee, may not be held civilly liable for the disclosure or the consequences of providing the information.

      There is a rebuttable presumption that an employer is acting in good faith when the employer provides information about the job performance, professional conduct, or evaluation of a former or current employee to a prospective employer of that employee, at the request of the prospective employer of that employee or at the request of the current or former employee.

      In the interpretation and application of this act, the public policy of this state is declared as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Negotiation of terms and conditions of labor should result from voluntary agreement between employer and employees. Governmental authority has permitted and encouraged employers to organize in the corporate and other forms of capital control. In dealing with such employers the individual unorganized worker is helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment. Therefore it is necessary that the individual workman have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.

        Equity procedure that permits a complaining party to obtain sweeping injunctive relief that is not preceded by or conditioned upon notice to and hearing of the responding party or parties, or that issues after hearing based upon written affidavits alone and not wholly or in part upon examination, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses in open court, is peculiarly subject to abuse in labor litigation for the reasons that

      Such order to show cause shall be served upon such party or parties as are sought to be restrained and as shall be specified in said order, and the restraining order shall issue only upon testimony, or in the discretion of the court, upon affidavits, sufficient, if sustained, to justify the court in issuing a temporary injunction upon a hearing as herein provided.

      Such a temporary restraining order shall be effective for no longer than five (5) days, and at the expiration of five (5) days shall become void and not subject to renewal or extension, provided however that if the hearing for a temporary injunction shall have been begun before the expiration of the said five (5) days the restraining order may, in the court’s discretion be continued until a decision is reached upon the issuance of the temporary injunction.

     <p>
      No temporary restraining order or temporary injunction shall be issued except on condition that complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate security sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss, expense, or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction, including all reasonable costs (together with a reasonable attorney’s fee) and expense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the court.
    The undertaking herein mentioned shall be understood to signify an agreement entered into by the complainant and the surety upon which a decree may be rendered in the same suit or proceeding against said complainant and surety, the said complainant and surety submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for that purpose. But nothing herein contained shall deprive any party having a claim or cause of action under or upon such undertaking from electing to pursue his ordinary remedy by suit at law or in equity.

        The fact that a complaint, otherwise involving a labor dispute, failed to charge that the public officers, whose duty it was to protect the company’s property, were unable or failed to do so does not operate to deprive the court of jurisdiction to grant an injunction, where the complaint and proof otherwise showed it to be entitled thereto; and this is true notwithstanding the fact that the existence of a labor dispute was disclosed by the employees’ answer.

        Where the only testimony tending to show that certain defendants participated in the acts complained of in a labor dispute between a street car company and its employees was based on hearsay, it did not constitute proof of the facts sought to be established and it was error to include the names of such employees in the judgment based on decree of such evidence.

        Union which represented employees of a construction company was guilty of engaging in a secondary boycott, where it established a picket line at entrance to a corporation plant where construction company was engaged on a job because employees of the corporation who belonged to another union were doing fabrication work on a tank being installed by the construction company, and such picketing could be enjoined.

        Where an employee was injured when his leg was pinned between a potato piler and a tractor drawn scraper unit as the employee was working in a cellar in which potatoes were stored on employer’s farm, employee’s cause of action arose not from an injury received in a warehousing operation but from an injury received in an agricultural pursuit.

        Measure of Costs.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The proper measure of attorney fees under subsection (2) of this section, a state law cause of action, is governed by the Idaho R. Civ. P. 54. Perkins v. U.S. Transformer W., 132 Idaho 427, 974 P.2d 73 (1999), overruled on other grounds, Poole v. Davis, 153 Idaho 604, 288 P.3d 821 (2012).

       <p>
        Although the language of subsection (2) of this section is broader than the language of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54, the rule is the proper measure for costs under this statutory section, since, without specific language to the contrary in the statute, the rules of civil procedure provide the correct basis by which to measure an award of costs in an action to collect unpaid wages. Perkins v. U.S. Transformer W., 132 Idaho 427, 974 P.2d 73 (1999), overruled on other grounds, Poole v. Davis, 153 Idaho 604, 288 P.3d 821 (2012).

       <p>
        The express prohibition of strikes by this section does not support the inference that the legislature must have intended to permit strikes by public school employees or it would have expressly prohibited such strikes as it did those by firefighters.

       </p>
       <p>
        By expressly prohibiting strikes by firefighters during the term of a contract, the legislature either impliedly recognized their right to strike after expiration of the contract or, at a minimum, opened the door to such contractual agreement as the parties might reach in that regard. Local 1494 of Int’l Ass’n of Firefighters v. City of Coeur d’Alene, 99 Idaho 630, 586 P.2d 1346 (1978).

        Strikes are prohibited after consummation and during the term of a written contract, but in that period of time after the old contract expires and before the new one is consummated, they are not prohibited and the parties are free to negotiate one way or another depending upon their relative economic strengths.

        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 112, added “reinstatement” in the section catchline; added the subsection (1) designation, and therein inserted “and mobile” in the first sentence, and in the second sentence, deleted “of manufactured homes, a manufactured home dealer” following “business as a manufacturer,” and substituted “retailer, resale broker, installer, service company, salesman or responsible managing employee” for “manufactured home installer, manufactured home service company or a manufactured home salesman”; and added subsections (2) and (3).

Each applicant for original licensure must submit a full set of the applicant’s fingerprints and any relevant fees directly to the Idaho state police and the federal bureau of investigation identification division for this purpose.”

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t44c25s44-2503ol11">
       A smoke detector (which may be a single station alarm device) shall be installed on any wall in a hallway or space communicating with each bedroom area and the living area on the living area side and, when located in a hallway, the detector shall be between the return air intake and the living area. Each smoke detector shall be installed in accordance with its listing and the top of the detector shall be located on a wall four (4) inches to twelve (12) inches below the ceiling. The detector may be battery-powered or may be connected to an electrical outlet box by a permanent wiring method into a general electrical branch circuit, without any switch between the over current protection device protecting the branch circuit and the detector.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c25s44-2503ol12">
       The walls, ceilings and doors of each compartment containing a gas-fired furnace or water heater shall be lined with five-sixteenth (5/16) inch gypsum board, unless the door opens to the exterior of the home, in which case, the door may be all metal construction. All exterior compartments shall seal to the interior of the mobile home.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c25s44-2503ol13">
       Each room designated expressly for sleeping purposes shall have an exterior exit door or at least one (1) outside egress window or other approved exit device with a minimum clear dimension of twenty-two (22) inches and a minimum clear opening of five (5) square feet. The bottom of the exit shall not be more than thirty-six (36) inches above the floor.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c25s44-2503ol14">
       All electrical systems shall be tested for continuity to assure that metallic parts are properly bonded, tested for operation to demonstrate that all equipment is connected and in working order, and given a polarity check to determine that connections are proper. The electrical system shall be properly protected for the required amperage load. If the unit wiring is of aluminum conductors, all receptacles and switches rated twenty (20) amperes or less directly connected to the aluminum conductors shall be marked CO/ALR. Exterior receptacles other than heat tape receptacles shall be of the ground fault circuit interrupter (GFI) type. Conductors of dissimilar metals (copper/aluminum or copper clad aluminum) must be connected in accordance with section 110-14 of the national electrical code.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c25s44-2503ol15">
       The mobile home’s gas piping shall be tested with the appliance valves removed from the piping system and piping capped at those areas. The piping system shall withstand a pressure of at least six (6) inch mercury or three (3) psi gauge for a period of not less than ten (10) minutes without showing any drop in pressure. Pressure shall be measured with a mercury manometer or a slope gauge calibrated so as to read in increments of not greater than one-tenth (1/10) pound or an equivalent device. The source of normal operating pressure shall be isolated before the pressure test is made. After the appliance connections are reinstalled, the piping system and connections shall be tested with line pressure of not less than ten (10) inches nor more than fourteen (14) inches water column air pressure. The appliance connections shall be tested for leakage with soapy water or a bubble solution. All gas furnaces and water heaters shall be vented to the exterior in accordance with chapter 9 of the uniform mechanical code.

         Water piping shall be tested and proven tight under a water pressure not less than the working pressure under which it is to be used. The water used for tests shall be obtained from a potable source of supply. A fifty (50) pound per square inch (344.5kPa) air pressure may be substituted for the water test. In either method of test, the piping shall withstand a test without leaking for a period of not less than fifteen (15) minutes.
    (b) A water test shall be applied to the drainage and vent system either in its entirety or in sections. If applied to the entire system, all openings in the piping shall be tightly closed, except at the highest opening, and the system filled with water to the point of overflow. If the system is tested in sections, each opening shall be tightly plugged except the highest opening of the section under the test and each section shall be filled with water, but no section shall be tested with less than a ten (10) foot (3m) head of water. In testing successive sections, at least the upper ten (10) feet (3m) of the next preceding section shall be tested, so that no joint or pipe in the structure, except the uppermost ten (10) feet (3m) of the system, shall have been submitted to a test of less than a ten (10) foot (3m) head of water. The water shall be kept in the system or in the portion under testing for at least fifteen (15) minutes before inspection starts. The system shall be tight at all points.
