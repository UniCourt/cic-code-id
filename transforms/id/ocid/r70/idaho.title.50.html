      § 50-101. Incorporation.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The residents of any unincorporated contiguous area (village) containing not less than 125 qualified electors may present a petition signed by a majority of the said electors to the board of commissioners of the county in which said petitioners reside, praying that they be incorporated as a city, designating the name they wish to assume and the metes and bounds of the proposed city.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the petition to incorporate filed as herein provided, the board of county commissioners petitioned shall have no jurisdiction to take any action thereon or enter an order of incorporation, regardless of the number of petitioners thereon, where the boundaries of the proposed new city approach any point within one (1) mile of the boundary limits of any existing city of less than five thousand (5,000) population, within two (2) miles of the boundary limits of any existing city of five thousand (5,000) but less than ten thousand (10,000) population, within three (3) miles of the boundary limits of any existing city of ten thousand (10,000) but less than twenty thousand (20,000) population, or within four (4) miles of the boundary limits of any existing city of twenty thousand (20,000) or more population, all populations as determined by the last official or special United States census, unless there is first furnished said board of county commissioners either (a) a certified copy of a resolution of the city council of any existing city within the above applicable distances of the proposed city approving said petition for incorporation, or (b) appropriate evidence that the city council of any existing city within the above applicable distances of the proposed city, if contiguous or adjacent, has rejected and refused to annex the area of the proposed city to the existing city upon the petition made as hereinafter set out. Where the proposed new city area lies within the applicable distance of one or more cities, all cities must approve the petition of incorporation. An existing city shall be deemed to have rejected and refused to annex the contiguous or adjacent area when a petition for annexation is filed prior to 90 days before the end of any fiscal year, and the city council, within 60 days after receipt of said petition has not by appropriate action, declared that such area will be a part of such existing city, effective not later than the last day of the fiscal year in which said petition was filed. Such petition shall be signed by a majority of the inhabitants paying real estate taxes within said area requesting annexation, contain a certain metes and bounds description of the area set out in the petition and certify that the area so described falls within the distance limits herein set forth. The existing city, the petitioners, as herein provided, or the board of county commissioners is granted the power to petition the district court for a declaration of the right on any disputes arising between any of the parties so named hereunder.

        When Acequia was incorporated as a village in 1952, the procedure was governed by former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t50c07s50-701" target="_self">§ 50-701</a></cite>. The statutes then in effect for “villages” contained no requirement of filing a proclamation declaring incorporation of a city with the secretary of state. So, since this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t50c01s50-102" target="_self">§ 50-102 </a></cite>were not enacted until 1967, even though Acequia has not filed with the secretary of state a proclamation declaring incorporation of a city, Acequia was a duly formed city when the ordinances in question were enacted.

        Where board of commissioners in making an order incorporating a city found that proposed boundaries were reasonable, any person who was aggrieved thereby had his remedy by appeal, and incorporation would not be held void because boundaries were improperly fixed, in absence of any showing that boundaries so fixed included an unreasonable amount of land. Wardner v. Pelkes, 8 Idaho 333, 69 P. 64 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order for incorporation of a village was appealable to district court by any person aggrieved thereby or by any taxpayer within territory affected by such incorporation. Gardner v. Blaine County, 15 Idaho 698, 99 P. 826 (1909).
    An appeal filed by city from order incorporating a village to which incorporation the city objected on the grounds that the proposed village contained fewer than 125 residents, that the proposed boundaries were irregular, bizarre and fantastic, that its incorporation would materially hamper the ordinary growth of the city would have been dismissed on the ground that the city was neither a “person aggrieved” by the order, nor a “taxpayer of the county” and therefore was not authorized to appeal under the provisions of former<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.31.html#t31c15s31-1509" target="_blank">§ 31-1509</a></cite>.

        Former section governing incorporation of villages did not provide for notice and none was required to be given to opponents of a proposed incorporation; further, the statute made it mandatory upon the county commissioners to create the village when petition therefor complied with statute and board was satisfied that a majority of the taxable inhabitants of the proposed village had signed the same and there were 125 or more inhabitants actually resident of the territory described in the petition.

        Fact that order of board of commissioners declaring town incorporated failed to designate metes and bounds of town did not affect legality of incorporation, where petition for incorporation clearly designated said boundaries and order referred to petition and granted it without change or modification. State ex rel. Holcomb v. Inhabitants of Pocatello, 3 Idaho 174, 28 P. 411 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that order incorporating a city did not state that 200 or more inhabitants were legal residents of territory described in petition did not render order void where same uses words “taxable inhabitants,” and shows that a sufficient number of taxable inhabitants signed petition.

        Attempted incorporation of a town was void where petition for incorporation failed to describe metes and bounds of any tract of land whatever. Wardner v. Pelkes, 8 Idaho 333, 69 P. 64 (1902).
    Former section governing incorporation of villages was satisfied if the petition for incorporation which was introduced into evidence without objection set forth the metes and bounds of the proposed village. In re Riggins, 68 Idaho 547, 200 P.2d 1011 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Withdrawal of names from a petition for incorporation of a proposed village on the plea that such signatures were made upon false information would not have been permitted where board of county commissioners had acted on such petition. In re Riggins, 68 Idaho 547, 200 P.2d 1011 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the district court found that the board of county commissioners did not abuse its discretion in granting one of the petitions for incorporation, then their order incorporating that area as a village should have been affirmed. In re Chubbuck, 71 Idaho 60, 226 P.2d 484 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there were two rival petitions for incorporation, one including the area in the other, the determination of whether a village in fact exists and its extent was first for the board of county commissioners and on review, the district court.

The statutes then in effect for “villages” contained no requirement of filing a proclamation declaring incorporation of a city with the secretary of state.

        The term “this act” throughout the section refers to S.L. 1967, Chapter 429 which is generally compiled as chapters 1 to 3, 6 to 10, 13 to 19, and 21 to 23, title 50, Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase “the time this act takes effect” in the first paragraph refers to the effective date of S.L. 1967, Chapter 429, which was effective April 12, 1967.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bracketed word “asserted” near the end of the first paragraph was inserted by the compiler to correct the enacting legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The references to “chapters 36, 43 or 49, title 50, Idaho Code” near the end of the section are to those chapters of the former title 50 of the Idaho Code which were repealed by S.L. 1967, ch. 429, § 472. Such provisions related to the commission plan, city manager plan and council-manager-mayor plan of government, respectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reference to “sections 50-805 through 50-904” near the end of this section (which appears in S.L. 1967, ch. 429, as a reference to sections 144 through 155) appears to be an error in the session law and, therefore, the bracketed reference to [sections 50-801 through 50-812, Idaho Code] has been inserted by the compiler.

        The historical progression of the relevant statutory sections shows the legislature’s intention to limit the officers required by statute to be appointed by the mayor with the consent of the city council. Police officers, once included in the above category, are not expressly enumerated in the present version of this section, and the apparent legislative intent was to delete police officers from the requirement of mayoral appointment, with city council approval, applicable to other officers.

      <li id="t50c02s50-208ol11">
       The treasurer of each city shall be the custodian of all moneys belonging to the city. He shall account for each fund or appropriation made in its annual budget appropriation or otherwise directed by the city council. Such accounting shall track the debits and credits relating thereto. The treasurer shall on a monthly basis, and no more than sixty (60) days after the conclusion of each month at a regular meeting of the city council, render an accounting to the city council showing the financial condition of the treasury at the date of such accounting. The report shall state the balances of accounts maintained in the city’s treasury. The treasurer shall also make available credit and debit details of all such accounts when required by the mayor or by action of the governing board. Making the quarterly treasurer’s report available for public review on the city’s website within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of each quarter shall satisfy publication requirements established by section 50-1011, Idaho Code.

      <li id="t50c02s50-208ol12">
       The treasurer shall also keep a record of all outstanding bonds against the city showing the number, amount of each, and to whom said bonds were issued; and when any bonds are purchased, paid or canceled. In his annual report, the treasurer shall describe particularly the bonds issued and sold during the year and the fiscal terms of the sale including the expenses related thereto.

        The only evidence necessary to show fresh pursuit is that the officer had knowledge that a crime or infraction was committed within his jurisdiction and that the officer pursued the suspect beyond the jurisdiction with the purpose of making an arrest, citing the suspect, or investigating the offense. Whether the officer’s lights are flashing and siren is blaring is objective evidence of the officer’s pursuit, but it is not necessary. It is well within an officer’s discretion to wait for a safe point to stop a vehicle. State v. Scott, 150 Idaho 123, 244 P.3d 622 (Ct. App. 2010).

        This section indicates that the decision to appoint police officers is entirely discretionary with the municipality and, thus, although police officers are public officers whose duties relate to governmental functions of a municipality, a police officer does not fill an office created by the laws of the state of Idaho. Even though a city may require a police officer to take an oath before assuming the obligations and responsibilities of office, police officers are not required by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.59.html#t59c04s59-401" target="_blank">§ 59-401 </a></cite>to take an oath, and, where defendant was charged with resisting an officer in the performance of his duty, the state was not required to prove that an oath of office was taken pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.59.html#t59c04s59-401" target="_blank">§ 59-401</a></cite>.

       Legislative intent. The legislature hereby declares and determines that it is the policy of the state of Idaho that cities of the state should be able to annex lands which are reasonably necessary to assure the orderly development of Idaho’s cities in order to allow efficient and economically viable provision of tax-supported and fee-supported municipal services, to enable the orderly development of private lands which benefit from the cost-effective availability of municipal services in urbanizing areas and to equitably allocate the costs of public services in management of development on the urban fringe.

       General authority. Cities have the authority to annex land into a city upon compliance with the procedures required in this section. In any annexation proceeding, all portions of highways lying wholly or partially within an area to be annexed shall be included within the area annexed unless expressly agreed between the annexing city and the governing board of the highway agency providing road maintenance at the time of annexation. Provided further, that said city council shall not have the power to declare such land, lots or blocks a part of said city if they will be connected to such city only by a shoestring or strip of land which comprises a railroad or highway right-of-way.

    (7) Annexation of noncontiguous municipal airfield. A city may annex land that is not contiguous to the city and is occupied by a municipally owned or operated airport or landing field. However, a city may not annex any other land adjacent to such noncontiguous facilities which is not otherwise annexable pursuant to this section.

        City’s argument that a property owner’s action to have an annexation agreement declared unenforceable because it was not pursued at the “earliest practicable time” and was, therefore, barred under subsection (6) of this section lacked merit; the “earliest practicable time” language is not intended to restrict the party’s right. Old Cutters, Inc. v. City of Hailey (In re Old Cutters, Inc.), 488 B.R. 130 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2012), aff’d, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45787 (D. Idaho Mar. 31, 2014).

       <p>
        Idaho cities have the essential power to contract for annexation and to charge an annexation fee, if such fee is necessary to “equitably allocate the costs of public services in management of development on the urban fringe.” However, nothing in this phrase or in any other provision of this section can be read to empower a city to charge more than an amount necessary to equitably allocate the costs of the public services.

       <p>
        This section does not authorize judicial review of denial of a developer’s application for annexation because it does not authorize judicial review of a category A annexation under the administrative procedures act. The right of judicial review depends upon an affirmative decision to annex property, and the legislature did not provide for judicial review when a city decides not to annex property. Black Labrador Investing, LLC v. Kuna City Council, 147 Idaho 92, 205 P.3d 1228 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, judicial review is not authorized for category A annexations. In re City of Shelley, 151 Idaho 289, 255 P.3d 1175 (2011).
    City ordinance annexing a subdivision pursuant to category A was based on substantial evidence where the city produced a surveyed map showing the subdivision was contiguous to existing city property, and established that the subdivision had been using city water system for many years, thereby impliedly consenting to annexation. In re City of Shelley, 151 Idaho 289, 255 P.3d 1175 (2011).

        Property owner’s obligation in an annexation agreement to pay a fee unquestionably in excess of that required to compensate the city for actual costs resulting from the annexation was unenforceable because nothing in the grant of power to cities under subsection (1) of this section authorized the city to condition annexation upon payment by the owner of more than its equitable share of the costs to be incurred by the city in annexing the property. Old Cutters, Inc. v. City of Hailey (In re Old Cutters, Inc.), 488 B.R. 130 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2012), aff’d, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45787 (D. Idaho Mar. 31, 2014).

        Where adjacent land had been annexed to a city under former section governing annexation by second-class cities, and all parties concerned had acquiesced therein, the authority of the city in such annexation could not have been collaterally attacked. Hatch v. Consumers’ Co., 17 Idaho 204, 104 P. 670 (1909), aff’d, 224 U.S. 148, 32 S. Ct. 465, 56 L. Ed. 703 (1912).

        Even when annexation was authorized, it must have been reasonable and the dividing of a drive-in theater business through the projection booth by the city limits line would have created problems, resulting in confusion in the levy of taxes, therefore such annexation of a part of the drive-in theater property would have been unreasonable.

        Village ordinance which attempted to annex a strip of five acres of land connected to the village by a corridor strip or shoestring about three miles long and five feet wide mostly within a public highway was not valid, since the territory sought to be annexed was not contiguous or adjacent to the village. Potvin v. Chubbuck, 76 Idaho 453, 284 P.2d 414 (1955).

        The only restrictions on city’s annexation of railroad property under former similar section were that it must be reasonably assumed to be necessary for orderly city development and that it must be land connected to city by more than just “shoe string or strip of land upon a public highway,” therefore when the railroads failed to produce proof that the annexation was not necessary for the orderly development of the city, the presumption of the validity of the duly enacted municipal ordinance continued to prevail.

        Where a village located in one county passed an ordinance annexing territory in another county, the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the land sought to be annexed was located, who filed an action for a declaratory judgment to determine validity of ordinance was entitled to maintain same as a quo warranto proceeding, though quo warranto was not the exclusive remedy for testing validity of annexation. Potvin v. Chubbuck, 76 Idaho 453, 284 P.2d 414 (1955).
    Municipal corporations had power to annex additional territory only under the conditions, restrictions and limitations which the legislature imposes; therefore if the essentials of the statute were lacking, annexation ordinance was void.

        The stipulation of the parties upon which the trial court based findings, showed without dispute that appellant’s agricultural lands had never been laid off, nor sold, nor bargained for sale, in lots, blocks or tracts of not exceeding five acres, therefore the annexation there under consideration, not having been accomplished in compliance with the statutory requirements, was void and the ordinance of the village so far as it attempted such annexation, was void.

People ex rel. Redford v. Burley, 86 Idaho 519, 388 P.2d 996 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs, owners of lands annexed to city by ordinance enacted pursuant to former law with notice to plaintiffs, were estopped from questioning validity of ordinance despite fact that at least some of their annexed lands were unsubdivided portions larger than five acres, devoted to agricultural uses; where plaintiffs failed to protest at the time of enactment of the ordinance and delayed bringing suit for more than two years, and where, as a result of the annexation, the value of plaintiffs’ lands were enhanced by work and expenditures of the city. Alexander v. Trustees of Village of Middleton, 92 Idaho 823, 452 P.2d 50 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the complaining party comes forward with sufficient evidence that the tract is greater than five acres, and that the land by present owner has not been laid off or subdivided into lots or blocks of more than five acres each, and that the present owner has not sold or begun to sell the land by metes and bounds in tracts not exceeding five acres, then such party will have satisfied the burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of the validity of the ordinance. Hendricks v. City of Nampa, 93 Idaho 95, 456 P.2d 262 (1969).

        Former law, somewhat similar to this section, did not cause property annexed to the city to automatically fall within the most restrictive classification under a zoning ordinance placing in such classification “all those parts of the city not specifically included in other zones,” but such ordinance referred only to property within the city at the time of its enactment.

     <p>
      Upon compliance with the provisions of section 63-215, Idaho Code, all the property situated within the said annexed territory shall be subject to taxation as other property and persons within the corporate limits of such city, as though said annexed portion had been a part of the said city from the date of its incorporation.

      When the annexed area or any part thereof is situated in any district, organized under the laws of this state, and said district is supported in whole or in part by taxes levied upon the annexed territory or any part thereof, and said district provides the same or similar services as that provided by the annexing city, the annexed area shall, upon the filing of the certified copy of said ordinance, be relieved of all liability for levies, taxes and assessments made by said district after the calendar year in which said annexation occurred. The purpose of this section is to prevent duplicate taxation of said annexed area for the same or similar services by such district and the annexing city.
     </p>
     <p>
      The filing of the certified copy of said ordinance shall constitute a withdrawal of said annexed territory from the district, offering the same or similar services to the annexed territory as the annexing city, which withdrawal shall be effective as of December 31 of the calendar year of annexation, such withdrawal shall have the same effect as if the withdrawal had been made by the statutory procedure for withdrawing from such district.

      However, this section shall not apply to public cemetery districts created prior to the date of the annexation ordinance, and that the annexing city may not levy taxes for cemetery maintenance within the bounds of an existing cemetery district. Cities which have heretofore levied taxes for cemetery maintenance on property within an existing cemetery district shall discontinue that practice from and after the date this act becomes effective.

The judge of such court, either before or after said hearing, may view the lands and premises sought to be detached, as well as other lands or property within the corporate limits of such city, which might in any way be affected by the granting of such petition, and lands on the outside of such city in the same vicinity or locality in which the lands sought to be detached are situated, and may consider such conditions as he finds in connection with the evidence introduced on the hearing, in making and arriving at his final decision and determination of the matter.

      No tract or tracts of land shall be detached from any city which by such detachment, would materially mar the symmetry of such city.

      If, upon the hearing, the court shall find that such tract or tracts of land are tracts containing at least five (5) acres and are included within the corporate limits of such city and the lands included within such tract or tracts are used exclusively for agricultural purposes, provided, however, if there is upon or over such tract or tracts of land a railroad or canal right of way, such tract or tracts shall, if no other reason exists, be deemed to be used exclusively for agricultural purposes, within the meaning of this section; that such lands do not receive sufficient special benefits to justify the retention of said lands within the corporate limits of such city, and that by the detachment of said lands the symmetry of the city would not be materially marred, then the judge of said court shall grant the prayer of said petition and shall enter judgment and decree accordingly: Provided, however, that if said petition prays for detaching several tracts of land the court may enter judgment granting the prayer of the petition as to such tract or tracts as come within his findings as aforesaid and deny such petition as to such tract or tracts which do not come within his findings as aforesaid.

    The landowners did not meet their burden to support the separation of their land from the corporate limits by proving land use exclusively for agricultural purposes, because although some trees had been taken from the property and some seedlings were planted at one time, there had been no ongoing cultivation of the soil, harvesting of crops, or production of plants.

       <p>
        Where respondents introduced a map of the city and the surrounding area showing the relationship between the city and respondents’ properties and respondents both testified concerning the various properties bordering their land, such evidence was competent relating to the question of symmetry. Hammond v. City of Chubbuck, 95 Idaho 618, 515 P.2d 565 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Symmetry means more than due proportion of the parts of a body, conformance and consistency, and correspondence or similarity of form on opposite sides of an axis or center, it also involves the ability of the municipality to regulate adjoining lands whose use affects the quality of life in residential and business districts of the community; thus, symmetry requires not only regularity in the shape of the city, but also a measure of consistency, harmony and uniformity of regulation. Ramey v. City of Blackfoot, 99 Idaho 264, 580 P.2d 1289 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The finding that the symmetry of the city would be materially marred by the detachment of the property was supported by substantial and competent evidence based on the district judge’s personal observations, maps, testimony and observations regarding the use of the surrounding properties, and the city’s ability to regulate adjoining lands whose use would affect the quality of life in residential districts.

       </p>
       <p>
        Word “symmetry” as used in former similar section had not been judicially defined. In determining whether or not symmetry of city would be materially marred by detachment, regard must have been had to contours of land covered by city. Gullies and hills, while geometrically marring symmetry, may still have left city symmetrical in terms of former section. Maxwell v. Buhl, 40 Idaho 644, 236 P. 122 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Symmetry was discussed, and evidence in case was held sufficient to sustain finding that land in question was not entitled to detachment. Ball v. Parma, 49 Idaho 40, 286 P. 24 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence justified judgment detaching lands from city on the ground that the plaintiff owned lands in excess of five acres within the corporate limits of the city, which were being used exclusively for agricultural purposes, and which did not receive sufficient special benefits, and that symmetry of city would not have been materially marred by their detachment.

Cities acting through their respective city councils may convey or lease city hospitals, and the equipment therein, subject to the following conditions:

        The legislature has provided this section as the method for municipal corporations to follow when vacating an alley; this section does not empower a municipal corporation to impose any conditions upon the vacation of an alley except for the proviso regarding impairment of the right of way, easements, and franchise rights of lot owners and public utilities.

        Where the evidence did not rebut the presumption that one-half of a vacated alley was conveyed with a first conveyance, even though the alley was not expressly mentioned, the decision of the district judge in favor of the grantee of that conveyance was affirmed. Carney v. Heinson, 133 Idaho 275, 985 P.2d 1137 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no substantive limitation on the power of a city to vacate under this provision, since the language merely indicates that reversion of ownership to adjacent landowners does not affect the rights of those who hold existing rights-of-way or easements independent of the public right-of-way that is vacated. Allison v. City of Coeur d’Alene, 133 Idaho 560, 990 P.2d 141 (1999).

        A lot owner whose property has been taken pursuant to this provision may seek compensation or challenge a city’s procedures or findings, but may not challenge the validity of the city’s actions solely because his rights have been impaired.

        A city ordinance that is in conflict with a state law of general application is invalid; this section, which applies to all municipal corporations in the State of Idaho and is an act of the state legislature, is clearly a state law of general application. It provides the method for municipal corporations to follow in vacating alleys. The two conditions that city imposed upon vacation of the alley, as well as the right of reversion should a certificate of occupancy not be issued, were not expressly granted powers, fairly implied powers from the clear language of this section, nor powers essential to the vacation of the alley; the only condition that this section allows upon a finding of expedience for the public good is that the vacation cannot impair “the right of way, easements and franchise rights of any lot owner or public utility.” Thus, the two conditions, as well as the right of reversion, were ultra vires acts by city because they conflicted with this section.

Such certificates shall vest in the proprietor, his or her heirs or assigns, a right in fee simple to said lots for the sole purpose of interment, under the regulations of the city council. Such certificates shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the proper county without further acknowledgment, and such description of lots shall be deemed and recognized as a sufficient description thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c03s50-320D">
       Regulation. — Limit the number of cemetery lots which may be owned by any person; prescribe rules for inclosing, adorning, and erecting monuments and tombstones on cemetery lots; prohibit any diversion of the use of such lots and any improper adornment thereof; but no religious test shall be made as to the ownership of lots, the burial therein or the ornamentation of graves or of such lots.

The election to be called shall be held only after notice thereof has been published at least once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, before the election, in the official newspaper of said city. Notice of such special election shall also be posted by the city clerk in three (3) public places in such city, at least ten (10) days before such special election. A city council may enter into agreements pursuant to this section to lease with the option to sell any plant or system described in this section.

        Where ditch had been constructed and operated in accordance with law, it was not nuisance, and could become one only by reason of manner in which it had been maintained and operated. Fact that municipality subsequently extended street along and included in it right of way for such ditch did not convert such ditch into a nuisance. City of Twin Falls v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the building was littered with debris, and transients were living there and using candles and cigarettes creating a fire hazard, these conditions being caused by the use to which the house was put were not hazards inherent in the building itself; therefore, the building could not be destroyed as a nuisance by the city, it being apparent such hazardous condition could be remedied by cleaning and repairs without major reconstruction.

         Cities may by ordinance elect to offer a traffic safety education program to all drivers issued an infraction citation by a city law enforcement officer for a moving violation not involving a collision. Citations allowing the traffic safety education program alternative shall only be issued pursuant to section 49-1501, Idaho Code, and as permitted by this section. Such traffic safety education program shall be for the purpose of educating drivers in traffic safety concepts. Drivers qualified under this section who desire to pay the fixed penalty and court costs in lieu of appearing in court on the citation may also elect to attend a traffic safety education program offered by a city under this section as an alternative to receiving violation points and insurance rating charges as provided in subsection (6) of this section. At the time of issuance of the citation, drivers shall elect whether they wish to attend the program and, if so, the citing officer shall record the election in the uniform citation. The citing officer shall provide to the driver a written notice of the available times, locations and the cost of the program or a written notice identifying a telephone number or internet website address where such information can be obtained. The driver shall have forty-five (45) days from the date of issuance of the citation to complete the traffic safety education program. A driver electing to attend the program shall pay the fixed penalty and court costs for the citation to the clerk of the court as provided in the citation and pay the program fee, if any, separately to the city at or before the time of attendance at the program. Any person who fails to complete the offered traffic safety education program within the forty-five (45) days after voluntarily electing to attend will not receive the relief provided in subsection (6) of this section. Before issuing a citation allowing the traffic safety education program alternative, the citing officer shall ensure that the driver is not disqualified under subsection (2) of this section.

         If the city collects a program fee from a driver disqualified from the traffic safety education program alternative, the city shall refund the program fee to the driver no later than ten (10) days following the discovery of the error. If the driver has already completed the program, the city shall, no later than ten (10) days following the discovery of the error, so notify the clerk of the court and the driver and shall advise the driver that the relief provided in subsection (6) of this section is not available and shall pay to the driver twenty-five dollars ($25.00) as liquidated damages for the error, in addition to refunding the program fee.
    (5) The city clerk or other authorized city official for the city in which the citation was issued shall within fifteen (15) days of the completion of the traffic safety education program by the cited driver transmit verification of the completion to the clerk of the county in which the citation was issued.
        </li>

        (6) When a person has successfully completed a traffic safety education program for an infraction citation, the infraction shall not result in violation point counts as prescribed in section 49-326, Idaho Code, nor shall the infraction be deemed to be a moving violation for the purpose of establishing rates of motor vehicle insurance charged by a casualty insurer.

      <li id="t50c03s50-345ol12">
       In a city which develops a computerized mapping system, the city council may impose and collect fees from the users of this system for the development, maintenance and dissemination of digital forms of the system. These fees shall not exceed the actual costs of development, annual maintenance and dissemination of the computerized mapping system. These fees shall not apply to official paper maps produced from the computerized mapping system.

        The clerk of the city council testified that a motion authorizing the lease of former hospital to state for use as correctional facility was presented at the December 20, 1989, meeting of the city council and that the city council took a final vote at that time. The trial court concluded that the oral motion made and passed by the city council amounted, in substance, to a “resolution” within the meaning of this section prior to execution of the lease. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the copy of the resolution into evidence. Foster v. City of St. Anthony, 122 Idaho 883, 841 P.2d 413 (1992). Cited Black v.

     <p>
      The city council of each city shall, prior to passing the annual appropriation ordinance, prepare a budget, estimating the probable amount of money necessary for all purposes for which an appropriation is to be made, including interest and principal due on the bonded debt and sinking fund, itemizing and classifying the proposed expenditures by department, fund or service, as nearly as may be practicable, and specifying any fund balances accumulated under section 50-1005A, Idaho Code. To support such proposed expenditure, the council shall prepare an estimate of the total revenue anticipated during the ensuing fiscal year for which a budget is being prepared classifying such receipts by source as nearly as may be possible and practicable, said estimate to include any surplus not subject to the provisions of sections 50-1004 and 50-1005A, Idaho Code, nor shall said estimated revenue include funds accumulated under section 50-236, Idaho Code. The proposed budget for the ensuing fiscal year shall list expenditures and revenues during each of the two (2) previous fiscal years by fund and/or department. Following tentative approval of the revenues and expenditures estimated by the council, the same shall be entered at length in the journal of proceedings. Prior to certifying to the county commissioners, a notice of time and place of public hearing on the budget, which notice shall include the proposed expenditures and revenues by fund and/or department including the two (2) previous fiscal years, and a statement of the estimated revenue from property taxes and the total amount from sources other than property taxes of the city for the ensuing fiscal year, shall be published twice at least seven (7) days apart in the official newspaper. At said hearing any interested person may appear and show cause, if any he has, why such proposed budget should or should not be adopted.

     <p>
      The city council of each city shall, prior to the commencement of each fiscal year, pass an ordinance to be termed the annual appropriation ordinance, which in no event shall be greater than the amount of the proposed budget, in which the corporate authorities may appropriate such sum or sums of money as may be deemed necessary to defray all necessary expenses and liabilities of such corporation, not exceeding in the aggregate the amount of tax authorized to be levied during that year in addition to all other anticipated revenues. Provided, the amount appropriated from property tax revenues shall not exceed the amount of property tax revenue advertised pursuant to section 50-1002, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such ordinance shall specify the object and purposes for which such appropriations are made and the amount appropriated for each object or purpose. Said ordinance shall be filed with the office of the secretary of state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The city council of any city may, by the same procedure as used in adopting the original appropriation ordinance at any time during the current fiscal year, amend the appropriation ordinance to a greater amount than that adopted, if after the adoption of the appropriation ordinance, additional revenue will accrue to the city during the current fiscal year as a result of increase in state or federal grants or allocations, or as a result of an increase in an enterprise fund or funds to finance the operation and maintenance of governmental facilities and services which are entirely or predominantly self-supporting by user charges, or as a result of an increase in revenues from any source other than ad valorem tax revenues. A city whose property tax certification is made for the current fiscal year may amend its budget and annual appropriation ordinance, pursuant to the notice and hearing requirements of section 50-1002, Idaho Code, prior to certification to the county commissioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      No further appropriation, except as herein provided, shall be made at any other time within such fiscal year unless the proposition to make each appropriation has been first sanctioned by a majority of the legal voters of such city, either by petition signed by them equal in number to a majority of the number who voted at the last general city election, or approved at a special election duly called therefor, and all appropriations shall end with the fiscal year for which they are made.

        Where city based connection fees charged users of water and sewer system on formula termed “equity buy-in” and city annually was required to revalue the fees pursuant to the formula and all revenue from the fees was placed in a separate account and used only for replacement of existing facilities and equipment, no moneys were placed in the general operating funds of the city and none was used for expansion or improvement of the existing system, it was not necessary that a municipality have an election such as prescribed in Const., Art. VIII, § 3 prior to changing the rates, fees or charges imposed in establishing the cost of public works services such as sewer or water connection fees. Loomis v. City of Hailey, 119 Idaho 434, 807 P.2d 1272 (1991).
    Where city, after receiving an engineering report, selected a system in which the new user buys into a portion of the current value of the water and sewer system capacity and such method attempts to determine the current value of the system and then apportion a share of the value of that system to a new user, the methodology used to determine the value of the system is not unreasonable, nor is it unreasonable to charge a new user the value of that portion of the system capacity that the new user will utilize at that point in time; and the fact the connection fee may be higher in such city than in other municipalities will not invalidate the fee as long as it is reasonable and is not primarily a source of revenue; thus, where ordinance specifically states that its intent is to “recover the costs of operating, maintaining, replacing, and depreciating the existing water and sewer systems and any extensions thereof,” there is nothing in the ordinance that is not authorized by the Idaho revenue bond act and court found no evidence in the record that the fees charged by the city were arbitrary or unreasonable. Loomis v. City of Hailey, 119 Idaho 434, 807 P.2d 1272 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cities can legally assess buy-in fees when those fees are reasonably connected to the actual costs such additional users will engender. The correct amount is to be calculated by dividing the net system replacement value by the number of users the system can support. The new user is charged the value of that portion of the system capacity that the new user will utilize at that point in time. N. Idaho Bldg. Contrs. Ass’n v. City of Hayden, 164 Idaho 530, 432 P.3d 976 (2018).

        So long as the fees collected pursuant to the Idaho revenue bond act are allocated and budgeted in conformity with that act they will not be construed as taxes.

        The fees, rates and charges imposed by a municipality must be reasonable and must produce sufficient revenue to support the public works project at the lowest possible cost.

        The legislature has not imposed exacting rate requirements upon localities. The law requires only that the fee be reasonably related to the benefit conveyed. Creating a fee structure for a wastewater system whereby every member of the general public would be charged only for his or her exact contribution of waste presumably could be established, but the system would be cumbersome and perhaps prohibitively expensive to maintain.

       <p>
        Where city, after receiving an engineering report, selected a system in which the new user buys into a portion of the current value of the water and sewer system capacity and such method attempts to determine the current value of the system and then apportion a share of the value of that system to a new user, the methodology used to determine the value of the system is not unreasonable, nor is it unreasonable to charge a new user the value of that portion of the system capacity that the new user will utilize at that point in time; and the fact the connection fee may be higher in such city than in other municipalities will not invalidate the fee as long as it is reasonable and is not primarily a source of revenue; since the ordinance specifically states that its intent is to “recover the costs of operating, maintaining, replacing, and depreciating the existing water and sewer systems and any extensions thereof,” there was nothing in the ordinance that is not authorized by the Idaho revenue bond act and the court found no evidence in the record that the fees charged by the city were arbitrary or unreasonable.

        Where the proceeds of the connection fee for water and sewer service are dedicated to the water and sewer systems, those funds are kept in a separate, segregated account and are not used for general fund purposes and, further, only users of those services are charged and those fees are not utilized for general fund or for future expansion of the water and sewer system because the funds collected from connection fees by the city are specifically allocated in accordance with the Idaho revenue bond act, the fees are not collected for general revenue raising purposes and are, therefore, not taxes requiring approval of the electorate; under these circumstances a municipality may collect fees, rates or charges pursuant to the power granted in the Idaho revenue bond act to pay for maintenance, depreciation and replacement of system components.

      Bond anticipation notes and the interest on them shall be secured by a pledge of the income and revenues derived by the city from the project to be undertaken with the proceeds of the bond anticipation notes and shall also be made payable from funds derived from the sale of the revenue bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued.

     <p>
      Any resort city may establish a city property tax relief fund into which may be placed all or any portion of revenues received from any nonproperty tax levied in accordance with the provisions of this act and such nonproperty tax revenues may be used to replace city property taxes in the ensuing fiscal year by the amount of nonproperty tax revenues placed in the city property tax relief fund if city voters have approved of such use of nonproperty tax revenues in the election authorizing such city nonproperty tax. Any resort city that receives more revenues from any local-option nonproperty tax than such city has budgeted shall establish a city property tax relief fund into which shall be placed all revenues received in excess of the budget amount and such excess revenues shall be used to replace city property taxes in the ensuing fiscal year by the amount of all excess revenues placed in said city property tax relief fund.

      Any ordinance assessing a tax pursuant to this act shall contain a finding by the local governing body of the city based upon evidence presented to it that the condition set forth in section 50-1044, Idaho Code, exists and shall provide the methods for reporting and collecting taxes due. Taxes collected pursuant to any such ordinance shall be remitted to the city official designated in such ordinance or other such official contracting, pursuant to this act, with the city to provide collection services, and shall constitute revenue of the city available for any lawful corporate purpose approved by city voters subject to the provisions of this act. In any election, the ordinance submitted to city voters shall: (a) state and define the specific tax to be approved; (b) state the exact rate of the tax to be assessed; (c) state the exact purpose or purposes for which the revenues derived from the tax shall be used; and (d) state the duration of the tax. No tax shall be redefined, no rate shall be increased, no purpose shall be modified, and no duration shall be extended without subsequent approval of city voters. An ordinance adopting any local-option nonproperty tax authorized by this act may provide for separate identification of taxes as may be appropriate. The city clerk of any city adopting an ordinance pursuant to this act shall, immediately following approval of such ordinance, or any amendment thereto, forward a copy of said ordinance or amendment to the chairman of the state tax commission, and the chairman of the state board of tax appeals.

        When an owner of land plats the land, files the plat for record, and sells lots by reference to the recorded plat, a dedication of public areas indicated by the plat is accomplished. However, just filing the plat is not enough: public dedication also requires that the plat show the owners’ intent clearly and explicitly. Rowley v.

        Landowners were not entitled to an interest in a plat’s common area because the plat was void: (1) although non-owners executed the plat, owners did not ratify the plat, so the plat granted no interest, and (2) platted land could not be dedicated by common law to owners of unplatted land.

        The recording of the plat which referenced the segments of land at issue constituted a dedication of public roadway easements, through the segments, which the original developer had been permitted to delay improving until a later date. In addition, the language of this section makes it clear that the recording of a plat denominating a public street transfers an interest equivalent to a fee simple. Volco, Inc. v. Lickley, 126 Idaho 709, 889 P.2d 1099 (1995).
    District court’s finding that a boundary by agreement existed was not clearly erroneous because a fence had been standing between two properties for more than 50 years; moreover, the parties involved were adjoining landowners, despite being separated by a dedicated road, because the parties had an ownership interest up to the center of the dedicated street. Neider v. Shaw, 138 Idaho 503, 65 P.3d 525 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an owner of land plats the land, files the plat for record, and sells lots by reference to the recorded plat, a dedication of public areas indicated by the plat is accomplished. However, just filing the plat is not enough: public dedication also requires that the plat show the owners’ intent clearly and explicitly. Rowley v. Ada County Highway Dist., 156 Idaho 275, 322 P.3d 1008 (2014).

        The recording of a subdivision plat is intended to partition property and creates legally-recognized lots within the subdivision. A land survey does not subdivide land, nor does the filing of such a survey indicate with what intent the landowner surveyed his property. State v. Bilbao, 130 Idaho 500, 943 P.2d 926 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate erred in dismissing complaint against defendant for misdemeanor illegal subdivision, after concluding the statute of limitations had run because the allegedly illegal subdivision occurred in 1985 with the filing of a land survey. The record before the magistrate did not support his conclusion that the allegedly criminal act occurred in 1985, and not later, because the document filed by defendant in 1985 was a land survey, which does not subdivide land, and not a plat. State v. Bilbao, 130 Idaho 500, 943 P.2d 926 (1997).

        The legislature did not intend for this section to invalidate contracts for the sale of realty because of the vendor’s failure to record the plat to lots or portions thereof sold or offered for sale; the language of the section does not prohibit the act of selling lots of an unrecorded plat nor does it mandate that the vendor must record the plat prior to contracting for the sale of the realty, but rather only mandates the forfeiture of a set sum if the vendor contracts for the sale of the realty without first acknowledging and recording the plat.

        An agreement to develop property was not void merely because the final plat of the property was not recorded at the time the agreement was executed.

      § 50-1317. Vacation procedure in unincorporated areas and in cities not exercising their corporate functions — Filing of petition — Notice of hearing.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any person, persons, firm, association or corporation interested in any city which if incorporated is not exercising its corporate functions may desire to vacate any lot, tract, private road, common, plot or any part thereof in any such city, it shall be lawful to petition the board of county commissioners of the county where such property is located, setting forth the particular circumstances of the case, and giving a distinct description of the property to be vacated and the names of the persons to be particularly affected thereby; which petition shall be filed with the appropriate county or highway district clerk and notice of the pendency of said petition shall be given for a period of thirty (30) days by written notice thereof, containing a description of the property to be vacated, posted in three (3) public or conspicuous places in said city, and also within the limits of said platted acreage, or in the event such property is located within a county in which there is published a newspaper, as defined by law, such notice shall also be published in such newspaper, once a week for two (2) successive weeks. Provided however, when a public street or public right-of-way is located within the boundary of a highway district or is under the jurisdiction of a county, the respective commissioners of the highway district or board of county commissioners shall assume the authority to vacate said public street or public right-of-way pursuant to section 40-203, Idaho Code. Land exclusive of public right-of-way that has been subdivided and platted in accordance with this chapter need not be vacated in order to be replatted.

     <p>
      Whenever the city council proposes to convey, exchange or offer for sale any real property, it shall first declare the value or minimum price, if any, it intends to receive as a result of such conveyance or exchange. The city council may contract for or provide that the property be appraised under such terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the city council. The declaration, either in the form of a minimum dollar value, or an explanation of an intended exchange or conveyance for other than monetary consideration shall be made on the record at a public meeting of the council. The city council may also declare that the subject property will be offered for sale without establishing a minimum price.

     <p>
      After a public hearing has been conducted, the city council may proceed to exchange, convey or offer for sale the real property in question, subject to the restrictions of section 50-1401, Idaho Code. The city council shall be governed by the following provisions:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t50c14s50-1403ol11">
       When the property is offered for sale, the property shall be sold at a public auction to the highest bidder and no bids shall be accepted for less than the minimum declared value previously recorded on the record at a public meeting of the council, provided however, if no bids are received, the city council shall have the authority to sell such property as it deems in the best interest of the city.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c14s50-1403ol12">
       When it is determined by the city council to be in the city’s best interest that the property be offered for exchange, the council may do all things necessary to exchange any property owned by the city for real property of equal value pursuant to terms which shall be a matter of public record.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c14s50-1403ol13">
       When property is purchased, donated or otherwise conveyed to a city and the city has previously used federal funding to acquire the property, with funds specifically designated for the purpose of assisting low- to moderate-income families with decent, safe, affordable housing opportunities, the property may be sold, donated or otherwise conveyed directly to a low- to moderate-income family, so long as the sale or conveyance is consistent with the applicable federal regulations under which the property was obtained initially. In such instances, the city council shall pass an ordinance stating:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t50c14s50-1403ol13a">
         That the property was acquired, in whole, with federal funds;

    The clerk of the city council testified that a motion authorizing the lease of former hospital to state for use as correctional facility was presented at the December 20, 1989, meeting of the city council and that the city council took a final vote at that time. The trial court concluded that the oral motion made and passed by the city council amounted, in substance, to a “resolution” within the meaning of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t50c09s50-902" target="_self">§ 50-902 </a></cite>prior to execution of the lease. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the copy of the resolution into evidence. Foster v. City of St. Anthony, 122 Idaho 883, 841 P.2d 413 (1992). Power Discretionary.

        This section permits a municipality to lease city property “not needed for city purposes, upon such terms as may be just and equitable”; this power to lease is a purely discretionary function entrusted to the elected officials of the municipality and, absent a clear abuse of that discretion, any decision made thereunder will not be overturned on appeal.

        Lease between telephone and telegraph company and the city of property being used for city hall and police station to telephone company was valid, and this section which authorizes “the lease of any property not needed for city purposes” does not prohibit a city council by resolution from determining that the leased property was not needed for city purposes in the present or future and was subject to city’s right of occupation during transitional period prior to obtaining new premises.

        However, chapter 250 is probably invalid. Such chapter, which was Senate Bill 1178, was passed by the senate as set out above. The bill in the house was amended by striking out the amendment to the section in its entirety. The bill was then returned to the senate but was not submitted to the senate for the approval of the amendments. The bill, without such amendments, was then enrolled and sent to the governor for signature.

      § 50-1504. Board of police retirement fund commissioners — Election — Term of office — Duties.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The city council of any city, having elected to establish a policeman’s retirement fund, together with three (3) members of the police department, shall constitute the board of police retirement fund commissioners. Each police department member, to be eligible for board membership, must be (a) a participating member of the fund; and (b) either on active duty or retired from the department and drawing benefits from the fund. For the purposes of this section “participating member” means any active member of the police department who contributes to the fund, or any retired member of the police department who receives benefits from the fund. The three (3) members from the police department shall be elected at an election held every two (2) years after the adoption of the provisions of sections 50-1501 through 50-1524, Idaho Code, and in the manner herein provided. In the event that the number of participating members eligible for board membership is limited to two (2) or fewer, a member may hold more than one (1) position on the board simultaneously.
     </p>
     <p>
      Not more than thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days preceding the date fixed by law for general city elections, written notice of the nomination of any participating member of said police department for membership on said board may be filed with the secretary thereof. Each petition of nomination shall be signed by not less than three (3) participating members of said police department, and nothing herein contained shall prevent any participating member of a police department from signing more than three (3) petitions of nomination. Said election shall be held on a date fixed by the secretary of the board, and shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days before the date fixed by law for the election as aforesaid. Notices of the dates upon which said petitions may be filed and of the date fixed for the election of members to said board shall be given by the secretary by posting written notices thereof in a prominent place in the police headquarters of said city and by mailing written notices to each participating fund member.

At such hearing the accused shall be afforded an opportunity of appearing in person or by counsel and presenting his defense. If such judgment or order be upheld by a majority of the commission, the accused may appeal therefrom to the court of original and unlimited jurisdiction in civil suits of the county wherein he resides. The court of original and unlimited jurisdiction in civil suits shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine such appeal in a summary manner; provided, however, that such hearing shall be confined to the determination as to whether the judgment or order of removal, discharge, demotion or suspension by the commission, was made in good faith and for cause, and no appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such ground or grounds.

        Findings of Commission.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The civil service commission made findings which complied on their face with this section, where the commission determined that the police officer used excessive force when disciplining his stepchildren, causing injuries to those children, that his actions demonstrated an inability to control his temper and an inability to react appropriately as a result thereof, that his inability to control his temper cast serious doubt upon his ability to perform his duties as a police officer, and that no evidence was presented suggesting he was discharged for political or religious reasons.

       <p>
        On judicial review of a civil service commission determination, the district court is required to conduct a full review of the whole record and, where the commission’s conclusions are unsupported by substantial evidence, its function encompasses stating, both for the benefit of the parties and the supreme court, its reasoning and conclusions which very well may but need not take the form of findings and conclusions.

       <p>
        Inasmuch as a municipality acquired no statutory jurisdiction to incur costs to be assessed against abutting property owners under the 1967 local improvement district code until after the city council had held a hearing for public protests, any costs generated prior to the proper creation of a special improvement district could not be assessed against allegedly affected property owners.

       The legislature finds that the development of architectural themes for cities is a legitimate method to further the public health, safety and welfare of cities. The purpose of the provisions of this section is to authorize cities to create local business improvement districts for the purpose of constructing and financing the cost and expense of improvements to the exterior portions of business buildings to bring business buildings within the district into conformity with the architectural theme adopted by the city. The improvement of business buildings in conformity with the architectural theme adopted by the city is hereby declared a public purpose.

        The ownership of property in a local improvement district (LID) does not disqualify a council member from participating in proceedings to form a LID or assess property levies. Simmons v. City of Moscow, 111 Idaho 14, 720 P.2d 197 (1986).

        Method of Assessment.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A basic qualification of an assessment method is that there must be a factual correlation between the result of an assessment formula and the actual benefit conferred. Simmons v. City of Moscow, 111 Idaho 14, 720 P.2d 197 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the “benefits derived” method of assessment pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, a municipality may consider square footage and zones based on the proximity to improvements made in reaching an equitable distribution of costs in relation to benefits. Simmons v. City of Moscow, 111 Idaho 14, 720 P.2d 197 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the “benefits derived” method of assessment pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, the city supported its choice of a 100-40-20 ratio to allocate improvement costs with testimony that an architectural firm had described to the steering committee and the city council a number of assessment methods, including the use of a ratio, the city council deliberated over the methods available, considering a 100-50-25 ratio as well as the one ultimately selected, and the assessments levied appeared to be reasonable approximations of value of the benefits derived by each property owner. Simmons v. City of Moscow, 111 Idaho 14, 720 P.2d 197 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the “benefits derived” method of assessment is used pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, “benefits” need not be defined as the increase in market value of each particular parcel of property before and after improvements, considering the property’s highest and best use. Instead, the city can consider special benefits, including stabilization of property values and rents; improved access to downtown businesses; enhanced ability to use the downtown area for public activities; increased safety for downtown pedestrians and business customers; improved appearance of the downtown area; and increased likelihood of preservation and restoration of historic downtown buildings. Simmons v. City of Moscow, 111 Idaho 14, 720 P.2d 197 (1986).
    The front or square footage methods of assessment are a less flexible method of apportioning costs than the benefits derived method. The front and square footage methods may be satisfactory where an improvement is limited in scope and of proportionally equal benefit to all affected properties, such as a sewer, a roadway or a water line; however, where benefits are contemplated to be less immediate and measurable, a method of assessment based solely on front or square footage will be inadequate. Simmons v. City of Moscow, 111 Idaho 14, 720 P.2d 197 (1986).

      Any owner of property to be assessed in the proposed local improvement district described in the notice of intention shall have the right, in advance of the hearing, to file in writing a protest to the creation of the district or making any other objections in relation thereto. At the date, time and place specified in the notice of intention the council shall in open and public session consider all protests which have been filed in writing in advance of the hearing, and the hearing may be adjourned from time to time to a fixed future time and place for the same until all such protests have been heard. The decision of the council as to all protests shall be conclusive and final, and if it should so determine, the council may delete any improvements or any property which had originally been contemplated in the said notice. If owners of more than two-thirds (2/3) of the property to be assessed protest any of the proposed improvements which affect their property, the council shall not proceed further with the work so protested unless a majority of the members of the full council shall vote to proceed with such work. The vote on the hereinafter mentioned ordinance creating the improvement district shall constitute the vote as to whether or not the council will proceed. Any property owner who fails to file a protest within the time specified, or having filed one withdraws said protest, shall be deemed to have waived any objection to the creation of the district, the making of the improvements, and the inclusion of his property in the district. Such waiver shall not preclude his right to object to the amount of the assessment at the later hearing provided for such purpose.

During this one hundred eighty (180) day period, the city council shall act as a review board for as much of the proposed district as is situated within the boundaries of the city, and the board of county commissioners shall act as a review board for that portion of the proposed local improvement district as is situated within the unincorporated portion of the county. As a review board, the city council or board of county commissioners shall review the record of the proposal, including conformance with procedural provisions of law. The city council or board of county commissioners shall also evaluate the necessity or desirability of the proposed district, and shall take into consideration the creation of the proposed local improvement district as it relates to the following:

     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t50c17s50-1709ol1a">

     <p>
      After the contract has been awarded and at such time as the council shall determine, the engineer shall prepare a duly certified report to the council showing in detail the total cost and expenses of the improvements and the dollar amounts of the same payable from assessments and from other sources. The report shall also contain a form of assessment roll numbering each assessment, giving the name, if known, of the owner of each lot or parcel of property assessed, and showing the amount chargeable to each lot or parcel of property according to the method of assessment originally contemplated by the council subject to any variations therefrom as a result of the engineer’s recommendation that benefits to be received by any lot or parcel of property warrant such a variation from the method chosen. Each lot or parcel of property shall be described with sufficient clearness to identify it, and if the engineer recommends any variations from the contemplated method of assessment, those variations shall be pointed out and the reasons for the same shall be given in the report. No assessment for water or sewer purposes shall be levied against any property of any public utility unless the latter shall agree to the same by filing a written consent in the office of the clerk of the municipality; and in the event that a local improvement district constructs water and sewer improvements as well as other improvements the engineer shall assess public utilities only for the amount of the total cost and expenses which the engineer finds to be attributable to such other improvements if no such consent has been given.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of the report, the council shall cause the assessment roll contained therein to be filed in the office of the clerk where it shall be available for public inspection. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place when and where the council will meet in open session and consider the report and the assessment roll and hear all objections to the assessment roll by the property owners of the district.

      At the time appointed for hearing objections to such assessment roll, the council shall consider the engineer’s report and the assessment roll and shall hear and determine all objections which have been filed by any party interested to the regularity of the proceedings in making such assessment, to the correctness of such assessment, to the amount levied on any particular lot or parcel of land, including the benefits accruing thereon and the proper proportionate share of the total cost of the improvements to be borne thereby and to the inclusion of any lot or parcel of land in the proposed district.

       After said hearing, the council shall pass an ordinance confirming the assessment roll as corrected by the council in relation to the benefits accruing thereon as a result of the improvements being made. The ordinance shall be the final determination of the regularity, validity and correctness of the assessment roll, of each assessment contained therein, and of the amount thereof levied on each lot or parcel of land, which ordinance shall contain a finding that each lot or parcel of land is benefited to the amount of assessment levied thereon subject to appeal as provided herein. Upon passage of the ordinance, the clerk shall certify and file the confirmed assessment roll with the treasurer of the municipality and the assessments therein shall be due and payable to the treasurer within thirty (30) days from the date of the adoption of the ordinance. The confirmed assessment roll and the assessments made by the confirmed assessment roll shall be a lien upon the property assessed from and after the date the following notice is recorded. Immediately upon passage of the confirming ordinance, the clerk shall file with the county recorder a notice which shall contain the date of the confirming ordinance and a description of the area or boundaries of the district. If any assessment is not paid in full within said thirty (30) day period, such assessment shall become delinquent and shall be collected in the same manner and with the same penalties and interest added thereto as hereinafter provided for delinquent assessments. The council may, in the alternative, determine to make assessments unpaid at the end of said thirty (30) day period payable in installments and to issue and sell registered warrants or installment bonds payable from such unpaid installments as herein provided. If the council chooses to do so, it shall provide in said ordinance that any property owner who has not paid his assessment in full within said thirty (30) day period will be conclusively presumed to have chosen to pay the same in installments, and the ordinance shall then establish the number of years said installments shall run, the dates of payment of the same, and the rate of interest that the unpaid assessments shall bear, which rate shall not be less than the rate of interest borne by the warrants or bonds payable therefrom, said interest running from the date of the passage of the assessment ordinance, irrespective of the date of its official publication, and being payable at the same time and place as the installment payments of assessments. Said installments shall be due and payable in not to exceed thirty (30) years to the treasurer or other proper officer as provided by the council. The ordinance shall establish the due date of the first installment payment and that the local or special assessments may be carried on the rolls of the municipality and collected as hereinafter provided. If any installment is not paid within twenty (20) days from the date it is due, the same shall become delinquent and the treasurer shall add a penalty of two percent (2%) thereto. In addition to any other method of collection provided in this code, the council may certify delinquent installments to the tax collector, and when so certified they shall be extended on the tax rolls and collected as are property taxes, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 10, title 63, Idaho Code. In the event that any property owner should choose to pay his assessment in full after such time as it has been conclusively presumed that he will pay in installments, such payment in full shall include the full amount of the unpaid assessment plus penalties and all interest payable on the same plus additional interest thereon at the rate provided in the bonds from the date of the last installment due to one (1) year after the next interest date of said bonds.

       Any errors in description, ownership of property, or amounts in any assessment ordinance adopted pursuant to this section may be corrected by the passage of an amendatory ordinance, which need set forth only the corrected descriptions or amounts. The passage of such amendatory ordinance shall serve only to postpone the thirty (30) day period for payment in full of the assessments actually affected by such amendatory ordinance, and the due dates of installments of such affected assessments shall be the same as the due dates of installments not affected. Notice of any assessments so affected shall be given in the same manner as hereinafter provided for the giving of notice of assessments.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person who has filed objections to the assessment roll or any other person who feels aggrieved by the decision of the council in confirming the same shall have the right to appeal to the district court of the county in which the municipality may be situated. Such appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the ordinance confirming the assessment roll by filing a written notice of appeal with the clerk of the municipality and with the clerk of the district court aforesaid describing the property and objections of the appellant. The appellant shall also provide a bond to the municipality in a sum to be fixed by the court, but not less than two hundred dollars ($200) with sureties to be approved by the court, conditioned to pay all costs to be awarded to the respondent upon such an appeal. After said thirty (30) day appeal period has run, no one shall have any cause or right of action to contest the legality, formality or regularity of said assessments for any reason whatsoever and, thereafter, said assessments and the liens thereon shall be considered valid and incontestable without limitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an appeal is filed within said period, the case shall be docketed by the clerk of said court in the name of the person taking the appeal against the municipality as “an appeal from assessments.” Said cause shall then be at issue and have precedence over all civil cases pending in said court, except proceedings under the act relating to eminent domain by cities and actions of forcible entry and detainer. Such appeal shall be tried in said court as in the case of equitable causes except that no pleadings shall be necessary. The judgment of the court shall be either to confirm, modify or annul the assessment insofar as the same affects the property of the appellant, from which judgment an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court as provided by law. In case the assessment is confirmed, the fees of the clerk of the municipality for copies of the record shall be taxed against the appellant with other costs.

        A reassessment made by a city under former similar section for the amount of the deficiency of the original assessment to pay bonds, issued to finance a local improvement, was a nullity as to property to which the United States had acquired title, although the government agents learned while they were acquiring the land that the original assessments were insufficient to pay the bonds.

       Assessments levied to pay the cost and expense of any improvement authorized by the provisions of this code, or any law of this state, shall constitute a lien upon and against the property upon which such assessment or assessments are made and levied from and after the date upon which the ordinance levying such assessment or assessments is passed, which lien shall be superior to the lien of any mortgage or other encumbrance, whether prior in time or not, and shall constitute such lien until paid, and until paid, such lien shall not, except as otherwise provided in this section, be subject to extinguishment, including but not limited to extinguishment by reason of the sale of the property assessed on account of the nonpayment of general taxes or the conveyance of such property by any means to the United States of America, or any agency thereof, the state of Idaho, or any county, city, school district, community college district, or other public body, agency or taxing unit in said state. When bonds have not been issued and said assessments made payable in installments as herein provided, such assessments shall be collected, or the property therein shall be foreclosed and sold for such assessments and costs, in a suit for that purpose by the municipality. Delinquent assessments certified to the tax collector for collection as provided in section 50-1715, Idaho Code, shall be governed by the provisions of chapter 10, title 63, Idaho Code. All provisions of chapter 10, title 63, Idaho Code, specifically including those governing collection, satisfaction, and extinguishment of delinquent amounts, shall apply to certified delinquent assessments in the same manner and to the same effect as delinquent property taxes.

       Such suit shall be in the name of the municipality as plaintiff and against any one (1) or more owners of property failing to pay such assessment or assessments as defendants. In any such proceedings where the court trying the same shall be satisfied that the improvements have been made or have been contracted for, which according to the true intent of this code would be properly chargeable to such property, a recovery shall be permitted and the lien enforced to the extent of the cost and expenses of the improvement which would be chargeable on such property notwithstanding any informality, irregularity or defect in any of the proceedings of such municipality or any of its officers, and such property shall be ordered sold for the payment of the assessment or assessments against it and the costs and expenses of such suit, including reasonable attorney’s fees, to be fixed by the court and prorated to each separate piece of property.

        In case municipal authorities failed or neglected to collect sewer district assessment or property owner refused or neglected to pay same, the warrant or bondholder could compel municipal authorities to act by writ of mandate, or could proceed in the ordinary way, to foreclose his lien through the district court in the same manner as he would foreclose any other mortgage or lien.

      Whenever any land against which there has been levied any special assessment by any municipality shall have been sold in part or subdivided, the council of that municipality shall have the power to order a segregation of the assessment.

     <p>
      Any person desiring to have such a special assessment against a tract of land segregated to apply to smaller parts thereof shall apply to the municipality which levied the assessment. If the council determines that a segregation should be made, it shall by ordinance order the clerk to make segregation on the original assessment roll as directed in the ordinance. The segregation shall be made as nearly as possible on the same basis as the original assessment was levied, and the total of the segregated parts of the assessment shall equal the assessment before segregation. The ordinance shall describe the original tract, the amount and date of the original assessment, and shall define the boundaries of the divided parts and the amount of the assessment chargeable to each part. A certified copy of the ordinance shall be filed with the county recorder. The council may require, as a condition to the order of segregation, that the person seeking it pay the municipality the reasonable engineering and clerical costs incident to making the segregation. No segregation need be made if the council shall find that by such segregation the security of the lien for such assessment will be so jeopardized as to reduce the security for any outstanding local improvement district obligations payable from such assessment.

Such bonds shall be payable each year from and after the date of the bonds and shall be of such denomination and bear interest, payable annually, at such rate as is determined by the council, but in no event shall such rate of interest be greater than the rate of interest borne by the unpaid assessments.

      The bonds shall be in such form and denomination as may be provided by the council and they shall mature serially over a period not exceeding thirty (30) years. The council may reserve the right to redeem any of the bonds at its option on any interest payment at such price or prices as determined by the council. The bonds shall be signed by the mayor of the city, the chairman of the board of county commissioners, the president of the highway district, or the chairman of the board of directors of a water and/or sewer district, as the case may be, and shall be countersigned by the treasurer and attested by the clerk of the municipality. No bond or coupon shall be invalid because an officer whose manual or facsimile signature thereon has ceased to hold office at the time of the delivery of the bonds so long as he held the office at the time such signature was placed on the bond or coupon. The coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of said officers and each bond shall have the seal of the municipality affixed thereto. Each bond shall provide that the principal thereof and the interest thereon are payable solely from the principal of an [and] interest on the unpaid assessments levied in the district to pay the total cost and expenses of the project concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      In lieu of bonds, registered warrants may be issued under the same circumstances and in the same manner as bonds, such warrants to be issued in payment of any or all costs or expenses of the improvements to the amount said costs or expenses were set out in the engineer’s report. The warrants shall be redeemable in numerical order and further shall be subject to all provisions of this code relating to local improvement bonds so far as the same may be applicable, including, but not limited to, the provisions of sections 50-1762 to 50-1769, Idaho Code.

     <p>
      If the council shall determine to issue and sell bonds, it may for the purpose of meeting any cost and expenses of making the improvements, as the same are installed prior to the sale of the bonds, issue interim warrants of the district payable to the contractor, [or] other proper person, upon estimates of the engineer, bearing interest at a rate provided by the council, which interim warrants together with the interest due thereon at the date of the issue of the bonds, shall be redeemed and retired from the proceeds of the sale of the bonds or prepayment of assessments.

Such certificate shall contain, besides the description of the property to be sold, the name of the person assessed, if known, or if unknown, that fact, the amount of the assessment of instalment [installment], plus penalty thereon; the number of the assessment and the name of the improvement district in which assessed; the date when such certificate will go to deed and shall bear interest from date thereof at the rate of ten per cent (10%) per annum. Such certificates shall be made in duplicate, bound together in books in numerical order and filed in the office of the treasurer; provided, that after one (1) such certificate has been issued no further delinquency certificate shall be issued for subsequent instalments [installments] of the same assessment, except as hereinafter provided, and whenever any subsequent installment shall thereafter become delinquent the treasurer shall so mark the same in the installment docket and add the penalty thereto, as hereinbefore provided, and the same shall draw interest at the rate of ten per cent (10%) per annum from date of delinquency until the end of the month in which it is paid.

Neither the holder nor the owner of any bond or warrant issued under the provisions of this act shall have any claim therefor, except for payment from the special assessments made for the improvement for which said bond or warrant was issued, and except as against the “Local Improvement Guarantee Fund” herein provided, and the municipality shall not be liable to any holder or owner of such bond or warrant for any loss to the guarantee fund occurring in the lawful operation thereof by the municipality.

      The council shall prescribe rules and regulations for the maintenance and operation of the guarantee fund not inconsistent herewith. After the creation of such fund, all money derived from the assignment of delinquency certificates, redemptions, sale of property under foreclosure for delinquent assessments, or from the rent or sale of property, title to which has been obtained by the municipality pursuant to this code, shall be paid into the “Local Improvement Guarantee Fund,” and all delinquency certificates issued and such property acquired shall be held by the municipality for the benefit of such guarantee fund.

After so acquiring title to real property, the municipality may lease or sell and convey the same for such price and on such terms as may be determined by the council, and any provision of law, charter or ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, and all proceeds resulting therefrom shall belong to and be paid into the guarantee fund, provided, however, that in any event the municipality purchases such property at tax sale or otherwise it shall not be sold for a lesser sum than the city paid therefor.

     <p>
      For the purpose of securing the payment of the principal of and interest on an issue of local improvement bonds, notes, warrants, or other short-term obligations, the council or other governing body of a governmental entity may create a reserve fund for each obligation in addition to or in lieu of a guarantee fund.

The reserve fund may be funded from the proceeds of the bonds, notes, warrants, or other short-term obligations, from special assessment payments, or from any other money legally available therefor. Reserve fund balances in excess of ten per cent (10%) of the principal amount of the bonds outstanding shall be used to reduce the annual assessments of those participants in the respective local improvement district whose prior assessments have been paid. Whenever the reserve fund is insufficient to meet claims for payment of principal and interest against the reserve fund, the governmental entity may appropriate funds from such other legally available sources as may be determined by the council or governing body of such governmental entity.

      § 50-1805. Contracts for distribution of water, collection and remission of irrigation district assessments.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every city incorporated under the laws of the state of Idaho shall have the power to enter into a contract in writing with an irrigation district organized or hereafter organized under the laws of the state of Idaho, or with any person, association or corporation where water has been purchased or is being furnished or used for lands within said irrigation district and within the boundaries of any such city, whereby such city shall assume the duty of the distribution of such water to the persons within such city having the right to the use thereof, and to receive such water at such place as shall be provided for in such contract. Such city may enter into a contract with any irrigation district to act as the agent of the irrigation district and be empowered to collect any or all assessments or charges which such irrigation district shall be authorized by law to levy upon all or any part of the lands within such city. Such assessments shall be entered upon the assessment roll as herein provided under an appropriate column to be known as “___________ Irrigation District Assessments” and shall remit to such irrigation district, annually or at more frequent intervals as the contract may provide[,] all moneys collected on account of such levy for the previous year or other remittance period provided by the contract, less the commission contracted to be paid for such collection. If the assessments become delinquent and the property is redeemed from such delinquency, the city shall remit the proportionate part of the amount collected on such delinquency, as the amount due for bonds and interest on such parcels of property shall bear to the other assessments contained in the original tax levy. If a tax deed is taken by the city and thereafter the property so taken is sold as provided in sections 50-1801 through 50-1835, Idaho Code, the irrigation district shall likewise receive its proportionate part of the sale price of such property so sold. Such city shall be entitled to compensation, for collecting assessments and making payments to the irrigation district, in an amount equal to the actual cost which the city incurred in collecting and making such payments. The city shall certify to the district annually, not less than three (3) weeks before the date set for making the annual assessment by the district, the amount set by the city as the cost of collecting and making such payments to the district, and that amount shall be included by the district in its assessments or charges for that year against the lands for which the city collects and makes payments to the district as provided by the contract. Nothing in sections 50-1801 through 50-1835, Idaho Code, shall be construed to make said city primarily liable for any such irrigation district assessments to be collected or obligations, except for the faithful remittance of the funds collected; provided, however, that under contracts where water rights are pooled for delivery and a uniform method of allocating the assessments and charges of the district has been adopted as authorized by section 50-1805A, Idaho Code, the city shall be primarily liable for all such irrigation district assessments to be collected, including operation, maintenance, and principal and interest on bonded or contract indebtedness.

      Except where a landowner makes a timely written demand for delivery of water in accordance with the water right or water rights allocated and made appurtenant to his lands, water rights may be pooled for delivery purposes, but such pooling shall not be deemed a change in place of use and shall not require compliance with sections [section] 42-108 or 42-222, Idaho Code. Failure of a landowner to make written demand for delivery of water in accordance with the water rights allocated and made appurtenant to his land, on or before March 1 of the applicable year, shall be deemed consent by that landowner to the pooling of water rights for delivery purposes as provided in this section. When water rights are pooled for delivery, the city shall adopt a uniform method of allocating the assessments and charges of the irrigation district against all lands for which water rights are thus pooled. The city shall furnish the district a certified list or map showing all lands for which water rights have been pooled and shall indicate that a uniform method of allocating assessments and charges has been established; and subsequent assessments and charges of the district against those lands shall be levied or made as if all such lands constituted a single parcel, but the assessments and charges of the district shall be allocated by the city proportionately and separately for each actual parcel of such lands, according to the list and apportionment of benefits made by the district for the applicable assessment or charge, and no lien shall attach to any parcel except for assessments or charges properly allocated to that parcel.

     <p>
      It is hereby declared: (a) That there exist in this state insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations and that persons of low income are forced to reside in such insanitary or unsafe accommodations; that within the state there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime, and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state and impair economic values; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) That these areas in the state cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income (as herein defined) would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise;
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) That the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which insanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions.

      § 50-1905. Creation of housing authorities.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any city of the state of Idaho, there may be created an independent public body corporate and politic to be known as a housing authority, which shall not be an agency of the city; provided, however, that such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the governing body of the city, by proper resolution, shall declare, at any time hereafter, that there is need for an authority to function in such city. The determination, as to whether or not there is such need for an authority to function (a) may be made by the governing body on its own motion or (b) shall be made by the governing body upon the filing of a petition signed by twenty-five (25) residents of the city, asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such city and requesting that the governing body so declare.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is need for a housing authority in the city if it shall find (a) that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such city or (b) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such city available to persons of low income or rentals they can afford. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or insanitary, said governing body may take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the sanitary facilities and the extent to which conditions exist in such building which endanger life or property by fire or other causes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this act shall prevent governing bodies from jointly creating by resolution an independent public body corporate and politic to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this act and to serve the best interests of their respective citizenry.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceeding, involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority. Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is such need for an authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms, no further detail being necessary, that either or both of the above enumerated conditions exist in the city. A copy of such resolution, duly certified by the clerk, shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An authority shall have power to issue bonds, from time to time, in its discretion, for any of its corporate purposes. An authority shall also have power to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying or retiring bonds previously issued by it. In order to carry out the purposes of sections 50-1901 through 50-1927, Idaho Code, an authority may issue, upon proper resolution, bonds on which the principal and interest are payable: (a) exclusively from the income and revenue of a housing project financed with the proceeds of such bonds, or (b) exclusively from such income and revenues together with grants and contributions from the federal government or other source in aid of such project, or (c) from all or part of its revenues or assets generally. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any income or revenues of the authority, or a mortgage of any housing project, projects or other property of the authority. Any pledge made by the authority shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made and recorded; the revenues, moneys or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority, irrespective or whether the parties have notice thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither the commissioners of any authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of an authority shall state on their face that they shall not be a debt of the city, the county, the state nor any political subdivision thereof and neither the city, the county, the state nor any political subdivision thereof shall be liable thereon, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds other than those of said authority. Bonds of an authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt from taxes.

      It is hereby found and declared that there exist in municipalities of the state deteriorated and deteriorating areas (as herein defined) which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of these conditions is a matter of state policy and state concern in order that the state and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of its revenue because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization and other forms of public protection, services and facilities.

     <p>
      It is further found and declared that certain of such areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this act, since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this act, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated, remedied or prevented; and that salvageable areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action as herein authorized, and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas.

     </h3>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t50c20s50-2006ol1a">
       There is hereby created in each municipality an independent public body corporate and politic to be known as the “urban renewal agency” that was created by resolution as provided in section 50-2005, Idaho Code, before July 1, 2011, for the municipality; provided, that such agency shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless: (1) the local governing body has made the findings prescribed in section 50-2005, Idaho Code; and provided further, that such agency created after July 1, 2011, shall not transact any business or exercise its powers provided for in this chapter until (2) a majority of qualified electors, voting in a citywide or countywide election depending on the municipality in which such agency is created, vote to authorize such agency to transact business and exercise its powers provided for in this chapter. If prior to July 1, 2011, the local governing body has made the findings prescribed in subsection (a)(1) of this section then such agency shall transact business and shall exercise its powers hereunder and is not subject to the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c20s50-2006ol1b">
       Upon satisfaction of the requirements under subsection (a) of this section, the urban renewal agency is authorized to transact the business and exercise the powers hereunder by a board of commissioners to be established as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t50c20s50-2006ol1b1">
         Unless provided otherwise in this section, the mayor, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, which shall consist of not less than three (3) commissioners nor more than nine (9) commissioners. In the order of appointment, the mayor shall designate the number of commissioners to be appointed, and the term of each, provided that the original term of office of no more than two (2) commissioners shall expire in the same year. The commissioners shall serve for terms not to exceed five (5) years, from the date of appointment, except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.
        </li>
        <li id="t50c20s50-2006ol1b2">
         For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a commissioner may be removed by a majority vote of the local governing body only after a hearing and after he shall have been given a copy of the charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and have had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. Any commission position that becomes vacant at a time other than the expiration of a term shall be filled by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, including the mayor, if applicable, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.
        </li>
        <li id="t50c20s50-2006ol1b3">
         By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may appoint and designate from among its members to be members of the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, provided that such representation shall be less than a majority of the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency of the members of the local governing body on and after July 1, 2017, in which case all the rights, powers, duties, privileges and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the local governing body, who shall, in all respects when acting as an urban renewal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform and accomplish the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended.
    (4) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may terminate the appointed board of commissioners and thereby appoint and designate itself as the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency for not more than one (1) calendar year.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t50c20s50-2006ol1c">
       A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services but shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties. Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (5) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may provide that the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall be elected at an election held for such purpose on one (1) of the November dates provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the ordinance may provide term limits for the commissioners. In this case, all the rights, powers, duties, privileges and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the elected board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, who shall, in all respects when acting as an urban renewal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform and accomplish the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended. The provisions of chapter 66, title 67, Idaho Code, shall apply to elected commissioners and the county election law shall apply to the person running for commissioner as if they were running for county commissioner. In the event of a vacancy in an elected commissioner position, the replacement shall be appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if that is the local governing body by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) In all instances, a member of the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency must be a resident of the county where the urban renewal agency is located or is doing business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners shall elect the chairman, cochairman or vice chairman for a term of one (1) year from among their members. An agency may employ an executive director, technical experts and such other agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. For such legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own counsel and legal staff. An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers under this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or before March 31 of each year a report of its activities for the preceding calendar year, which report shall include a complete financial statement setting forth its assets, liabilities, income and operating expense as of the end of such calendar year. The agency shall be required to hold a public meeting to report these findings and take comments from the public. At the time of filing the report, the agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the community a notice to the effect that such report has been filed with the municipality and that the report is available for inspection during business hours in the office of the city clerk or county recorder and in the office of the agency.
    (d) An urban renewal agency shall have the same fiscal year as a municipality and shall be subject to the same audit requirements as a municipality. An urban renewal agency shall be required to prepare and file with its local governing body an annual financial report and shall prepare, approve and adopt an annual budget for filing with the local governing body, for informational purposes. A budget means an annual estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      (e) An urban renewal agency shall comply with the public records law pursuant to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, open meetings law pursuant to chapter 2, title 74, Idaho Code, the ethics in government law pursuant to chapter 4, title 74, Idaho Code, and the competitive bidding provisions of chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code.

Any commission position which becomes vacant at a time other than the expiration of a term shall be filled by a majority vote of the board.

        The rule at common law that utilities must relocate at their own expense is not an absolute but is subject to legislative provision to the contrary, and also subject to any constitutional prohibition or requirement; however in the absence of clear legislative direction the courts will decline to abolish the common-law rule and establish a rule requiring relocation costs to be paid to permissive users such as the utilities, inasmuch as the urban renewal law appears to contemplate payment of relocation costs to those with more substantial property interests.

       An urban renewal project for an urban renewal area shall not be planned or initiated unless the local governing body has, by resolution, determined such area to be a deteriorated area or a deteriorating area or a combination thereof and designated such area as appropriate for an urban renewal project.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c20s50-2008ol1b">
       An urban renewal agency may itself prepare or cause to be prepared an urban renewal plan, or any person or agency, public or private, may submit such a plan to an urban renewal agency. Prior to its approval of an urban renewal project, the local governing body shall submit such plan to the planning commission of the municipality, if any, for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the municipality as a whole. The planning commission shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed urban renewal plan to the local governing body within sixty (60) days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning commission, or if no recommendations are received within said sixty (60) days, then without such recommendations, the local governing body may proceed with the hearing on the proposed urban renewal project prescribed by subsection (c) hereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c20s50-2008ol1c">
       The local governing body shall hold a public hearing on an urban renewal project, after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation of the municipality. The notice shall describe the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing, shall generally identify the urban renewal area covered by the plan, and shall outline the general scope of the urban renewal project under consideration.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c20s50-2008ol1d">
       Following such hearing, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal project and the plan therefor if it finds that (1) a feasible method exists for the location of families who will be displaced from the urban renewal area in decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within their means and without undue hardship to such families; (2) the urban renewal plan conforms to the general plan of the municipality as a whole; (3) the urban renewal plan gives due consideration to the provision of adequate park and recreational areas and facilities that may be desirable for neighborhood improvement, with special consideration for the health, safety and welfare of children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by the plan; and (4) the urban renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the urban renewal area by private enterprise: Provided, that if the urban renewal area consists of an area of open land to be acquired by the urban renewal agency, such area shall not be so acquired unless (1) if it is to be developed for residential uses, the local governing body shall determine that a shortage of housing of sound standards and design which is decent, safe and sanitary exists in the municipality; that the need for housing accommodations has been or will be increased as a result of the clearance of slums in other areas; that the conditions of blight in the area and the shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing cause or contribute to an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare; and that the acquisition of the area for residential uses is an integral part of and essential to the program of the municipality, or (2) if it is to be developed for nonresidential uses, the local governing body shall determine that such nonresidential uses are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper growth and development of the community in accordance with sound planning standards and local community objectives, which acquisition may require the exercise of governmental action, as provided in this act, because of defective or unusual conditions of title, diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, improper subdivisions, outmoded street patterns, deterioration of site, economic disuse, unsuitable topography or faulty lot layouts, the need for the correlation of the area with other areas of a municipality by streets and modern traffic requirements, or any combination of such factors or other conditions which retard development of the area.

       An urban renewal plan may be modified at any time: Provided that if modified after the lease or sale by the urban renewal agency of real property in the urban renewal project area, such modification may be conditioned upon such approval of the owner, lessee or successor in interest as the urban renewal agency may deem advisable and in any event shall be subject to such rights at law or in equity as a lessee or purchaser, or his successor or successors in interest, may be entitled to assert.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c20s50-2008ol1f">
       Upon the approval by the local governing body of an urban renewal plan or of any modification thereof, such plan or modification shall be deemed to be in full force and effect for the respective urban renewal area, and the urban renewal agency may then cause such plan or modification to be carried out in accordance with its terms.

       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, where the local governing body certifies that an area is in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm, or other catastrophe respecting which the governor of the state has certified the need for disaster assistance under 42 U.S.C. section 5121, or other federal law, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal plan and an urban renewal project with respect to such area without regard to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section and the provisions of this section requiring a general plan for the municipality and a public hearing on the urban renewal project.

Such bonds shall be made payable, as to both principal and interest, solely from the income, proceeds, revenues, and funds of the urban renewal agency derived from or held in connection with its undertaking and carrying out of urban renewal projects under this act: Provided, however, that payment of such bonds, both as to principal and interest, may be further secured by a pledge of any loan, grant or contribution from the federal government or other source, in aid of any urban renewal projects under this act, and by a mortgage of any such urban renewal projects, or any part thereof, title to which is in the urban renewal agency.

      Except for consolidation of revenue allocation areas, a revenue allocation area may only be amended to extend its boundaries as set forth herein. An amendment to an urban renewal plan that does not seek to increase the geographic area of the plan, or does not seek to extend the years of the plan beyond the maximum term allowed under chapter 29, title 50, Idaho Code, is not a prohibited amendment, but may be subject to the limitations set forth in section 50-2903A, Idaho Code. No plan amendment shall be interpreted to or shall cause an extension of the limitations established for the existing revenue allocation area as set forth in section 50-2904, Idaho Code. Subject to the limitations in this section and section 50-2903A, Idaho Code, an urban renewal plan that includes a revenue allocation area may be extended only one (1) time to extend the boundary of the revenue allocation so long as the total area to be added is not greater than ten percent (10%) of the existing revenue allocation area and the area to be added is contiguous to the existing revenue allocation area but such contiguity cannot be established solely by a shoestring or strip of land which comprises a railroad or public right-of-way.

      Any governing body may on its own initiative, or upon a petition signed by at least sixty per cent (60%) of the resident owners of property subject to assessment within such proposed improvement district requesting the creation of an improvement district as provided for in this chapter, pass a resolution by the affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all members of the governing body at any regular or special meeting declaring that it finds that the improvement district is in the public interest. It must be determined that the formation of the local improvement district for a purpose set out in this chapter will promote the public convenience, necessity, and welfare. The resolution must state that costs and expenses will be levied and assessed upon the property benefited and further request that the appropriate public utility serving such area by overhead electric or communication facilities shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the receipt of the resolution, make a study of the cost of extension or conversion of its facilities. The resolution shall provide for payment of the public utility’s costs and expenses associated with preparing the costs and feasibility report in the event the improvement district is not created. The report of said study shall be provided to the governing body and made available in its office to all owners of land within the proposed improvement district. The resolution of the governing body shall require that the public utility be provided with the name and address of the owner of each parcel or lot within the proposed improvement district, if known, and if not known, the description of the property and such other matters as may be required by the public utility in order to perform the work involved in the cost study. The study shall further list each lot or parcel within the proposed improvement impact area. The appropriate public utility serving such improvement district area shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the resolution, make a study of the costs of extension or of conversion, and shall provide the governing body and make available at its office a joint report of the results of the study.

The cost estimate contained in the report shall not be considered binding on the public utility if construction is not commenced within six (6) months of the submission of the estimate for reasons not within the control of the utility. Should such a delay result in a significant increase in the conversion cost, new hearings shall be held on the creation of the district. In the event that a ten per cent (10%) or less increase results, only the hearing on the assessments need be held again.

      At time and place specified in the notice, the governing body shall meet and shall proceed to hear and pass upon all protests and requests so made, and its decisions shall be final and conclusive. Such hearing may be adjourned from time to time to a fixed future time and place. If at any time during the hearing, it shall appear to the governing body that changes in the proposed improvements or the proposed district should be made, which, after consultation with the public utilities concerned, appear to affect either the cost or the feasibility of the improvement, the hearing shall be adjourned to a fixed time and place and a new cost and feasibility report shall be prepared on the basis of the contemplated changes. Notice and an opportunity to protest shall again be given on the basis of such contemplated changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      If protests against the making of the improvement are received from the owners of more than two-thirds (2/3) of the assessable property within the proposed improvement district, the district and project shall be abandoned.

      After the hearing has been concluded, and after all the protests and requests have been considered, the governing body may make such changes in the proposed improvements or in the area to be included in the district as it may consider desirable or necessary, providing said changes are not substantial. However, no such changes shall be made without a new costs and feasibility report being prepared, and public hearing held, if the public utilities concerned deem it necessary or such changes are determined to be substantial by the governing body.

      The governing body shall, after considering matters brought forth at the hearing, either abandon the district and project or adopt an ordinance establishing the district and authorizing the project. Such ordinance shall be published in the manner provided in subsection (8) of section 50-2509 [50-2508], Idaho Code, but need not be mailed. If an ordinance be adopted establishing the district, such ordinance shall finally and conclusively establish the regular organization of the district against all persons, unless an action attacking the validity of the organization shall be commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction within thirty (30) days after the adoption of such ordinance. Such action shall be subject to the provisions of section 50-2511[, Idaho Code]. Thereafter, any such action shall be perpetually barred and the organization of said district shall not be directly or collaterally questioned in any suit, action, or proceedings.

     <p>
      After the preparation of the aforesaid ordinance, notice of a hearing on objections to the proposed assessments shall be given. Such notice shall be given in the same manner as provided under section 50-1713, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each notice shall state the time at which the governing body will hear and consider all objections to the assessment roll by the parties aggrieved by such assessments. Such notice shall further state that the owner or owners of any property which is assessed in such assessment roll may file with the clerk of the governing body his written objections to said assessments and to the amount levied on any particular lot or parcel in relation to the benefits accruing thereon and in relation to the proper proportionate share of the total cost of the improvement. Failure to file a written objection pursuant to section 50-2517 [50-2509], Idaho Code, shall constitute the grant of an easement for extension or conversion purposes to the district as provided in said section. The district after obtaining all easements required for the extension or conversion project shall, prior to commencement of construction, convey these easements to the utility. The time within which such objections shall be filed shall be specified in the notice but in no case shall it be less than fifteen (15) days from the date of the first publication of such notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice shall further state where a copy of the ordinance proposed to be adopted levying the assessments against all real property in the district will be on file for public inspection, and that subject to such changes and corrections therein as may be made by the governing body, it is proposed to adopt the ordinance at the conclusion of the hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The published notice shall describe the boundaries or area of the district with sufficient particularity to permit each owner of real property therein to ascertain that his property lies in the district. The mailed notice may refer to the district by name and date of creation and shall state the amount of the assessment proposed to be levied against the real property of the person to whom the notice is mailed. In the absence of fraud, the failure to mail any notice does not invalidate any assessment or any proceeding under this chapter.

      In all cases of assessments for improvements under this chapter against any property, persons or corporations whatsoever, wherein said assessments have failed to be valid in whole or in part for want of form or sufficiency, informality, irregularity or nonconformance with the chapter provisions, or laws governing such assessments, the governing body shall be, and they are hereby, authorized to reassess such special taxes or assessments and to enforce their collection, in accordance with the provisions of law existing at the time the reassessment is made. But no mistake, in description of the property, or the name of the owner, shall be held to affect any assessment or any lien created thereby under the provisions of this chapter, or any law of this state, unless such mistake or error renders it impossible to identify the property so assessed.
     </p>
     <p>
      When for any cause, mistake or inadvertence, the amount assessed shall not be sufficient to pay the cost and expenses of the improvement made and enjoyed by owners of property in any local improvement district where the same is made, it shall be lawful, and the governing body is hereby directed and authorized to make reassessments on all property in said local improvement district sufficient to pay for such improvements, such reassessment to be made and collected in accordance with the provisions of the law existing at the time of its levy.

      No municipality may give or lend any money or property in aid of a public corporation chartered under the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that a municipality may accept grants from the United States government or any agency thereof and apply grants in connection with industrial development facilities. The municipality that creates a public corporation shall annually review any financial statements of the public corporation and at all times shall have access to the books and records of the public corporation. No public corporation may issue revenue obligations under this chapter except upon the approval of both the municipality under the auspices of which it was created and the county or city within whose planning jurisdiction the proposed industrial development facility lies. No revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to this chapter unless the issuer makes a finding that in its opinion the interest paid on the bonds will be exempt from income taxation by the federal government. Revenue bonds issued by a corporation under this chapter shall not be considered to constitute a debt of the state, of the municipality or of any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision or agency of this state or to pledge any or all of the faith and credit of any of these entities. The revenue bonds shall be payable solely from both the revenues derived as a result of the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds, including, without limitation, amounts received under the terms of any financing document or by reason of any additional security furnished by the user of the industrial development facility in connection with the financing thereof, any money and other property received from private sources. Each revenue bond shall contain on its face statements to the effect that:

       A public corporation may incur only those financial obligations which will be paid from revenues received pursuant to financing documents, from fees or charges paid by users or prospective users of the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds or from the proceeds of revenue bonds. A public corporation established under the terms of this chapter constitutes an authority and an instrumentality of the municipality which creates it (within the meaning of those terms in the regulations of the United States treasury and the rulings of the Internal Revenue Services prescribed pursuant to section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended) and may act on behalf of the municipality under whose auspices it is created for the specific public purposes authorized by this chapter. The public corporation is not a municipal corporation within the meaning of the state constitution and the laws of the state or a political subdivision within the meaning of the state constitution and the laws of the state, including without limitation article VIII, section 4, of the Idaho constitution. A municipality shall not delegate to a public corporation any of the municipality’s attributes of sovereignty, including, without limitation, the power to tax, the power of eminent domain and the police power.

     <p>
      Each public corporation may provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued for an industrial development facility under this chapter, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption or maturity of the revenue bonds and commissions, service fees and other expenses necessary to be paid in connection with the refunding bond issue, and if considered advisable by the public corporation, for the additional purpose of financing improvements, extension or enlargements to the industrial development facility or another industrial development facility. The issuance of the revenue bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties and obligations of the public corporation in respect to the same shall be governed by this chapter insofar as applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be refunded, and regardless of whether or not the bonds to be refunded were issued in connection with the same project or separate projects or for any other purpose hereunder, and regardless of whether or not the revenue bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise.

     <p>
      Any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement between the public corporation and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement may evidence a pledge or assignment of the financing documents and lease, sale or loan revenues to be received from a lessee or purchaser of or borrower with respect to an industrial development facility for the payment of principal of and interest on and any premium on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable and may provide for creation and maintenance of reserves for these purposes. A trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond holders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvements, maintenance, use, repair, operation and insurance of the industrial development facility for which the bonds are authorized, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all money. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of revenue bonds or of revenues may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the corporation. A trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of private corporations. In addition, a trust agreement may contain such provisions as the public corporation considers reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders which are not in conflict with this chapter.

       <p>
        It is hereby found and declared that there exists in municipalities a need to raise revenue to finance the economic growth and development of urban renewal areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas. The purpose of this act is to provide for the allocation of a portion of the property taxes levied against taxable property located in a revenue allocation area for a limited period of time to assist in the financing of urban renewal plans, to encourage private development in urban renewal areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas, to prevent or arrest the decay of urban areas due to the inability of existing financing methods to promote needed public improvements, to encourage taxing districts to cooperate in the allocation of future tax revenues arising in urban areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas in order to facilitate the long-term growth of their common tax base, and to encourage private investment within urban areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas. The foregoing purposes are hereby declared to be valid public purposes for municipalities.

       Except as provided in section 50-2903A, Idaho Code, “base assessment roll” means the equalized assessment rolls, for all classes of taxable property, on January 1 of the year in which the local governing body of an authorized municipality passes an ordinance adopting or modifying an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision, except that the base assessment roll shall be adjusted as follows: the equalized assessment valuation of the taxable property in a revenue allocation area as shown upon the base assessment roll shall be reduced by the amount by which the equalized assessed valuation as shown on the base assessment roll exceeds the current equalized assessed valuation of any taxable property located in the revenue allocation area, and by the equalized assessed valuation of taxable property in such revenue allocation area that becomes exempt from taxation subsequent to the date of the base assessment roll. The equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property in a revenue allocation area as shown on the base assessment roll shall be increased by the equalized assessed valuation, as of the date of the base assessment roll, of taxable property in such revenue allocation area that becomes taxable after the date of the base assessment roll, provided any increase in valuation caused by the removal of the agricultural tax exemption from undeveloped agricultural land in a revenue allocation area shall be added to the base assessment roll.

The agency shall cause the ordinance to be filed with the office of the county recorder and the Idaho state tax commission as provided in section 63-215, Idaho Code. Upon notification of revenues sufficient to cover expenses as provided herein, the increment value of that revenue allocation area shall be included in the net taxable value of the appropriate taxing districts when calculating the subsequent property tax levies pursuant to section 63-803, Idaho Code. The increment value shall also be included in subsequent notification of taxable value for each taxing district pursuant to section 63-1312, Idaho Code, and subsequent certification of actual and adjusted market values for each school district pursuant to section 63-315, Idaho Code.

Provided however, the duration of a revenue allocation financing provision may be extended as provided in section 50-2904, Idaho Code.

      § 50-2904. Authority to create revenue allocation area.
     </h3>
     <p>
      An authorized municipality is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt, at any time, a revenue allocation financing provision, as described in this chapter, as part of an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance. A revenue allocation financing provision may be adopted either at the time of the original adoption of an urban renewal plan or the creation by ordinance of a competitively disadvantaged border community area or thereafter as a modification of an urban renewal plan or the ordinance creating the competitively disadvantaged border community area. Urban renewal plans existing prior to the effective date of this section may be modified to include a revenue allocation financing provision. Except as provided in subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section, no revenue allocation provision of an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance, including all amendments thereto, shall have a duration exceeding twenty (20) years from the date the ordinance is approved by the municipality; and provided further, no additions to the land area of an existing revenue allocation area shall be interpreted to or shall cause an extension of the date of the twenty (20) year limit that was originally established for the revenue allocation area. Notwithstanding these limitations, the duration of the revenue allocation financing provision may be extended if:

     <ol>
      <li id="t50c29s50-2904ol11">
       The maturity date of any bonds issued to provide funds for a specific project in the revenue allocation area and payable from the revenue allocation financing provision exceeds the duration of the revenue allocation financing provision, provided such bond maturity is not greater than twenty (20) years; or

      <li id="t50c29s50-2904ol13">

The duration of the revenue allocation financing provision set forth in this subsection may be extended if the maturity date of any bonds issued to provide funds for a specific project in the revenue allocation area and payable from the revenue allocation financing provision exceeds the duration of the revenue allocation financing provision, provided such bond maturity is not greater than thirty (30) years or may be extended as set forth in subsection (2) of this section.
    (5) During the extension set forth in subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section, any revenue allocation area revenues exceeding the amount necessary to repay the bonds during the period exceeding the maximum year maturity of the revenue allocation financing provision shall be returned to the taxing districts in the revenue allocation area on a pro rata basis.

A political subdivision may, upon reasonable advance written notice, but not more frequently than once in any calendar year, review the business records of a system operator to the extent necessary to ensure proper and accurate payment of the video service provider fee. A system operator shall provide sufficient information about such revenues to a political subdivision to allow a proper compliance review by such political subdivision. The system operator shall keep all business records reflecting any gross revenues, even if there is a change in ownership, for at least three (3) years after those revenues are recognized by the system operator in its books and records. All records reasonably necessary for the audit shall, at the discretion of the political subdivision, be made available by the system operator at the location within the jurisdiction where the records are kept in the ordinary course of business, or may be provided electronically to the political subdivision with its consent. The political subdivision and the system operator shall each be responsible for their respective costs of the audit, unless the audit discloses that the system operator has underpaid the video service provider fee by more than seven percent (7%) during the examination period, in which case the system operator shall pay all of the reasonable and actual costs of the audit.

       For purposes of determining whether a system operator has violated the provisions of this section, cost, density, distance and technological or commercial limitations shall be taken into account. An alleged violation shall only be considered within the description of the service area set forth in a certificate of franchise authority. The inability to serve an end user because a holder of such certificate is prohibited from placing its own facilities in a building or property shall not be found to be a violation of the provisions of this section. The requirements of this subsection shall not be construed as authorizing any build-out requirements on a system operator.

       Any potential residential subscriber or group of residential subscribers who believes it is being denied access to services in violation of the provisions of this section may file a complaint with the governing authority of the political subdivision within the service area of the system operator in which the subscribers or potential subscribers reside. The complaint shall provide a clear statement of the facts and information upon which it bases the complaint. Upon receipt of any such complaint, the governing authority shall serve a copy of the complaint and supporting materials upon the subject system operator, and shall require the system operator to submit a written answer and other relevant information in response to the complaint within thirty (30) days from service of the complaint on the system operator. If the governing authority, after examination of the complaint and answer thereto, is not successful in informally resolving the dispute, the governing authority may require the system operator and the complainants to enter into mediation. Alternatively, either party may seek judicial determination of the issues. If a court finds that the holder of a certificate of franchise authority is denying access to video service to any group of potential residential subscribers because of the income level of the residents in the local area in which such group resides, the holder of a certificate of franchise authority shall provide access to video service to the affected group of potential subscribers within a reasonable period of time, as specified by the court, to cure such noncompliance.

Provided however, a request by a political subdivision for the provision of PEG channels by a system operator, or a waiver of the requirement to provide PEG channels, shall be uniformly applied to all system operators providing video service within the political subdivision.

If more than one (1) political subdivision is served by a single or common head-end or hub office, the populations within the jurisdictions of all those political subdivisions shall be aggregated to determine the total number of PEG channels under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.

If the PEG agency cannot produce or maintain PEG programming in that manner or form, the agency shall do so in a manner that conforms to the then existing industry standards. If a change by the PEG agency in the manner or form of the content or programming is required, and such change conforms to the then existing industry standards, the system operator shall accept such programming for transmission over its video service network in the manner that is most economical to the system operator.
    (2) The production and content of any programming aired on any channel provided for PEG use shall be solely the responsibility of the public, educational and governmental agencies receiving the benefit of such capacity. The system operator shall bear the responsibility for the transmission of such content only to the extent that such content complies with the requirements of subsection (1)(f) of this section.

      (3) Governmental entities utilizing channels for PEG use shall make the programming available to all video service providers providing service within such governmental entity’s jurisdiction in a nondiscriminatory manner. Each system operator shall be responsible for providing one (1) point of connectivity to the governmental entity’s PEG channel distribution point within the jurisdiction to be served. The governmental entity providing programming for use on a channel designated for PEG use may request a change of the point of connectivity but shall pay the system operator for all costs associated with the change of the point of connectivity.

      (4) No franchising entity may require a video service provider to provide any institutional network or equivalent capacity on its video service network.

      (5) Where technically feasible, a system operator shall use reasonable efforts to interconnect its video network for the purposes of sharing PEG programming with other video service providers. Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable, microwave link, satellite or other reasonable method of connection. System operators shall negotiate in good faith to provide interconnection of PEG channels. The video service provider requesting interconnection shall pay all costs for such interconnection.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) The operation of any PEG channel provided pursuant to this section and the production of any programming that appears on each such channel shall be the sole responsibility of the governmental entity receiving the benefit of such channel, and the system operator shall bear only the responsibility for the transmission of the programming on each such channel to subscribers and the initial cost of connecting to existing and obligated PEG access channels.

The ballot used in such election shall be in form substantially as follows: “In favor of issuing bonds to the amount of .......... dollars for the purpose stated in Resolution No. ...,” and “Against issuing bonds to the amount of ......... dollars for the purpose stated in Resolution No. ...”.

The developer shall be consulted and shall be given a reasonable period of time within which to appear, either in person or in writing, and respond to any proposed financial assurance. If, following such developer’s response, the district board determines that reasonable financial assurance shall be required, the district board shall specify the type and amount of the financial assurance required in its resolution.

     <p>
      (7) Completion of community infrastructure may be phased and payment made pursuant to a draw schedule. Bond proceeds shall be expended on the community infrastructure within three (3) years after issuance. Prior to issuance of the bonds, the district board shall determine that such bond proceeds can reasonably be expended within that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) Each year, prior to the time for the certification required under section 50-3114, Idaho Code, the district board shall levy a tax upon all taxable real property within the district, sufficient, together with any money from the sources described in section 50-3107(3), Idaho Code, to pay debt service on the bonds when due. The levy shall be made by resolution entered upon the minutes of the district board, and it shall be the duty of the clerk of the district, immediately after entry of the resolution in the minutes, to transmit to the board of county commissioners in each county in which the district is located the certification required under section 50-3114, Idaho Code. Such tax levied shall then be collected and accounted for at the time and in the form and manner as other taxes are collected and accounted for under the laws of this state. Moneys derived from the levy of property taxes to pay the debt service on the bonds shall be kept separately from other funds of the district. A district’s levy of property taxes shall constitute a lien on all taxable real property within the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      (9) The district may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund general obligation bonds of the district authorized by this section. The principal amount of the refunding bonds may be more or less than the principal amount of the bonds being refunded, provided that the proceeds of the refunding bonds are used only for refunding purposes and payment of the costs thereof, and the total obligation of the district is not increased, that is, if the amount of the refunding bonds is more than the principal amount of the bonds being refunded, issuance of the refunding bonds will result in a net present value savings to the district. No election shall be required in connection with the issuance and sale of such refunding bonds. Refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section shall have a final maturity date no later than the final maturity date of the bonds being refunded.
