       <p>
        After-acquired property clauses in chattel mortgages are invalid insofar as applied to a shifting stock of merchandise, unless the mortgage contains a proper accounting provision. Diamond Nat’l Corp. v. Lee, 333 F.2d 517 (9th Cir. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the accounting provision of after-acquired property, as regards shifting stock, will invalidate a chattel mortgage. Diamond Nat’l Corp. v. Lee, 333 F.2d 517 (9th Cir. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        For protection of creditors, Idaho law requires a provision with reference to sales and accounting be incorporated on a shifting stock of goods; where such provision is ignored and a substituted provision never incorporated into a chattel mortgage on the shifting stock of merchandise, the mortgage is void. Diamond Nat’l Corp. v. Lee, 333 F.2d 517 (9th Cir. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mortgagee failed to require that mortgagor comply with provision with respect to sales and accounting the mortgage did not constitute a valid lien on the shifting stock of logs and lumber, as against the trustee in bankruptcy, and this applies to the rights under a valid field warehouse arrangement. Diamond Nat’l Corp. v. Lee, 333 F.2d 517 (9th Cir. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence is not in conflict that the chattel mortgagee failed to require compliance by the bankrupt with accounting provisions of the mortgage, the court is not bound by the referee’s conclusion that the mortgage was valid as to the shifting stock of merchandise.

      § 45-108. Lien for performance of future obligations — Validity — Priority.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A lien may be created by contract, to take immediate effect, as security for the performance of obligations not then in existence, which lien, if not invalid on other grounds, shall be valid as against all persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      The validity of such contracts and liens as security for any obligation is not affected as against any person by the fact that the contract does not specify, describe or limit the obligations to be secured as to purpose, nature, time, or amount of the obligations to be secured.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such liens, if otherwise valid, are valid against and prior and superior to all rights, liens and claims acquired by other persons in the property subject thereto after the contract creating such liens was made, except in cases where the person in whose favor the obligation secured by such lien was created, had actual notice of the existence of such subsequent right, lien or claim at the time such obligation was created, and are prior and superior to such subsequent rights, liens or claims irrespective of such or any notice in the following cases:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t45c01s45-108ol11">
       Where the person, in whose favor the obligation secured thereby was created, was legally bound to make the advance or give the consideration resulting in such obligation.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c01s45-108ol12">
       Where the consideration for such obligation was necessarily and actually applied to the maintenance and/or preservation of the property subject to the lien.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Making the advance or giving the consideration to result in an obligation not in existence at the time such a contract creating a lien to secure the same is made, is optional with the person making the advance or giving the consideration unless he is bound by an express contract to the contrary which shall not be implied from the fact that the contract to secure such obligation was made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Obligations otherwise within the limits and description of those specified in any contract creating a lien to secure the performance of obligations not then in existence, but created in favor of any person to whom the original party to be secured by the lien created by such contract has transferred such contract, shall also be secured thereby in like manner as similar obligations between the original parties thereto.

        The general rule in the United States is that if a future advance is obligatory, it takes its priority from the original date of the mortgage, and the subsequent creditor is junior to it; however, if the advance is optional, and if the mortgagee has notice when the advance is made that a subsequent creditor has acquired an interest in the land, then the advance loses its priority to that creditor.

        A purchase money mortgage must be a part of one continuous transaction involving the purchase of land; however, the execution of the mortgage and the transfer of the deed need not be strictly contemporaneous. When a deed and mortgage are executed as part of the same transaction, the mortgage is not granted to the mortgagee after the mortgagor has obtained title; rather, the mortgagor takes title already encumbered by the mortgage. Insight LLC v. Gunter, 154 Idaho 779, 302 P.3d 1052 (2013).

       </h4>
       <p>
        This Act is a successor to the Revised Federal Tax Lien Registrations Act as revised by the Conference in 1966. The changes made in the previous Act are brought about by the provisions of the Pension Reform Act which prescribes the method of perfecting the employer liability lien to the same as for federal tax liens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore, the Act has been changed and now applies to the employer liability lien established by Section 4068(a) of the Pension Reform Act as well as a federal tax lien. Other similar liens that may be perfected like a federal tax lien, such as the provisions for collection of federal fines contained in proposed revisions to the federal criminal laws, are within the scope of this Act.

        In order to accommodate to commercial convenience so far as possible within the limitations of Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code, filing with the secretary of state is provided for the lien on tangible and intangible personal property of partnerships and corporations (as those terms are defined in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the implementing regulations) thus including within “partnerships” such entities as joint ventures and within “corporations” such entities as joint stock corporations and business trusts.

        In some jurisdictions, a question may be raised concerning the propriety of incorporating federal law by reference. In others, the place of filing described in this Act may not correspond to the place of filing under the Uniform Commercial Code. Alteration of this Act in these respects may create the peril that the notices will be filed in the federal district court, thus eliminating the benefits of this Act.

        An amendment to the Uniform Federal Lien Registration Act promulgated by the Uniform Law Commissioners in 1982. Two new subparagraphs (2) and (3) were inserted under Section 2(c). The new paragraphs locate the appropriate filing offices for notice of federal liens against personal property held in trusts or estates. The amendment does not change the Act substantively. It had been assumed that federal liens could be filed against personal property held in trusts or estates at least under Section 2(c)(4) (Section 2(c)(2) prior to the 1982 amendment). However, Section 2(c)(4) does not designate a specific office in which notice of federal liens should be filed. New Section 2(c)(2) and (3) explicitly provide for filing in the office of the Secretary of State. The amendment was suggested by the Internal Revenue Service.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Because most purchases and secured transactions involving personal property of natural persons relate to consumer goods or farm personal property, searches for liens against those persons are more likely to be made at the local level. Thus, with few exceptions a search for corporation federal tax liens with the secretary of state and for natural persons with an officer in the county of residence will normally be in the same office as searches for security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code.
    Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code “locates” all tangible and intangible personal property at the residence of the taxpayer even though it is physically located elsewhere in the same or in another state. State law cannot vary this requirement. State law does affect the result, however, in that state law determines the “residence” of a taxpayer. See IRC § 6323(f)(2). Filing at the physical location of personal property of a taxpayer who is not a resident of the state of location of the property cannot be required.

        It is the practice of the Internal Revenue Service to regard a “certificate of discharge” as primarily referable to specific pieces of property, so a certificate of discharge corresponds to a release under Section 9-406 [now repealed] of the Uniform Commercial Code. A “certificate of release” in tax practice is equivalent to a “termination statement” in Section 9-404 [now Section 9-513] of the Uniform Commercial Code in the sense that it is a general statement applicable to all property or types of property referred to in the termination statement.

        It is understood that the Treasury accepts the obligation to pay nondiscriminatory filing fees for filing notice of tax liens but desires those payments to be on a monthly billing basis. For notice of tax lien on real property, the filing fee for a real estate mortgage may serve as a standard; for a filing fee on notice of tax lien on personal property the filing fee for filing a financing statement may serve as a standard. There is now no established practice concerning fees for other notices. The certificate of discharge is comparable to a satisfaction of a real estate mortgage and to release of collateral under Section 9-406 [now repealed] of the Uniform Commercial Code. Those instruments are usually filed by persons other than the Treasury, and a filing fee for filing them should be prescribed.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       A different problem is presented by certificates of release or non-attachment. Sometimes those certificates serve the purpose of permitting the public filing official to clear his records, and for that purpose the filing fee perhaps should be low in order to induce filing. Sometimes those notices are filed for purposes of the taxpayer. Given the volume of notices of tax liens which are filed daily in large filing offices, it may serve the public interest to have filed certificates of release. From the standpoint of the Treasury, those certificates serve no important purpose, and the Treasury may not file them if the fee is large. In adoption of this Act, consideration should be given by the states to providing a substantially smaller fee for filing a certificate of release, so that when a tax case is closed the Treasury will file those releases in a routine manner in order to reduce the storage and administrative problem of the local and state filing officers.
    2. It is understood that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will accept the same obligations as those imposed on the Treasury for federal tax liens.

Vollmer Clearwater Co. v. Union Whse. & Supply Co., 43 Idaho 37, 248 P. 865 (1926).
    Where claimant alleged that lien was filed on certain date, general denial did not justify judgment on pleadings since it was the notice and not the lien that was to be filed. Linch v. Perrine, 51 Idaho 152, 4 P.2d 353 (1931).

        Where notice of lien described crop only as a crop of apples and there were in fact no apple trees growing on land described, such notice was insufficient to create a lien. Linch v. Perrine, 51 Idaho 152, 4 P.2d 353 (1931).

        The lien granted by former similar section was against the crop, not against the land; therefore, it was the crop which should have been described so that it might have located with reasonable certainty. The statute did not require a legal description of the property from which the crop was grown. Sage v. Richtron, Inc., 108 Idaho 837, 702 P.2d 875 (Ct. App. 1985).

       <p>
        Liens are not defective because the notices do not set forth the specific type of farm work performed in harvesting the crops; thus, a claim upon the crops “for labor performed, assistance rendered and expenses incurred” provides language meeting the essential requirements of former similar section. Sage v. Richtron, Inc., 108 Idaho 837, 702 P.2d 875 (Ct. App. 1985).

        Where the crops were delivered to a grain company before the plaintiffs filed their claims of liens, pursuant to this section, but the grain company still had possession of the crops and had not paid the purchase price when it received notice of the claimed liens, the proceeds from the sale of the crops was subject to the liens; thus, the bond or under-taking stood for the payment of any judgment, including costs and attorney’s fees, rendered in favor of the lien claimants.

        Lien for services rendered in connection with hauling gravel and placing the gravel on mill yard site of the bankrupt, to facilitate stacking of lumber for drying and enable bankrupt to transport the logs to the mill, was not a lien for work, labor and services performed in logging or in manufacturing saw logs into lumber.

    The mere relationship of landlord and tenant does not make the tenant the agent of the landlord for the furnishing of material or labor, hence the interest of the landlord is not subject to a mechanic’s lien for material and labor furnished under contract with the tenant unless there is consent or ratification thereto by the landlord.

        As a general principle, a tenant is not the “agent” of the landlord, for the purpose of this section, merely by virtue of a lessor-lessee relationship; however, a landlord’s interest in real property may be subjected to a lien, for work performed by agreement with the tenant, if the lease specifically requires the tenant to see that the work is done or, alternatively, the landlord’s interest may be subjected to a lien if he requests the work to be done. The latter alternative applies to any case where the landlord has done some act in ratification of, or consent to, the work done and the furnishing of material and labor. Christensen v. Idaho Land Developers, Inc., 104 Idaho 458, 660 P.2d 70 (Ct. App. 1983).

        The Supreme Court of Idaho has held that this statute grants the right to claim a lien for the value of the labor or material furnished and used in or about the construction, alteration or repair of the building, structure or other works. That right of lien is based on the theory that the claimant has, either by his labor or by the materials furnished and used, contributed to the construction or improvement of the property against which the lien is asserted; where the labor is not used or the materials are not incorporated into the building, structure or improvement, no lien on land or building results.

        The lien statutes would not cover such work as checking over tools and the like, and, therefore, where the filing of the lien was not within the time provided by law for the filing of the same after terminating the work, unless such work be considered, although such work was performed within the time for the filing of the lien, it cannot serve to extend the time to file the lien.

        This section creates two distinct types of liens — a lien against some form of structure, alternately referred to in later sections of the lien law as an “improvement,” and a lien created in favor of one who improves the land itself, by grading, leveling, and the like. A person making the first type of improvement “has a lien upon the same,” i.e., the improvement itself. On the other hand, a person who improves any land by grading, filling or leveling, obtains a lien against “the same,” i.e., the land. Hopkins Northwest Fund, LLC v.

       <p>
        Evidence sustained finding that, at special instance of contractor, lumber company furnished material for use in repairing owners’ dwelling, as against contention that the materialman was principal, on whose behalf contractor acted, and was not entitled to benefit of materialmen’s lien law for material furnished because of failure to complete the contract to repair. Idaho Lbr. & Hdw. Co. v. DiGiacomo, 61 Idaho 383, 102 P.2d 637 (1940).

    Section 45-605 requiring claimant to establish full amount of claim in order to recover a penalty does not apply to suit to foreclose mechanic’s lien, since lien is for security and is not a penalty. Guyman v. Anderson, 75 Idaho 294, 271 P.2d 1020 (1954). Tenant Contracting for Work.

        Liens could not be foreclosed against tenant who contracted for material and labor where there was no proof that he had a tenant’s interest in the real estate. Bunt v. Roberts, 76 Idaho 158, 279 P.2d 629 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        No lien was acquired against landlord’s interest where the evidence showed that work, labor and material were furnished solely at the request of the tenant. Bunt v. Roberts, 76 Idaho 158, 279 P.2d 629 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the “authorization” given by lessor for alterations to his property really amounted only to consent to have lessee expend approximately $40,000 in remodeling effort, contractor never looked to nor relied upon lessor for any part of the remodeling cost until after it had done the work and lessee had failed to pay for it, and lessee expected to exercise his option to purchase at a predetermined price which was consistent with the value of the premises and lots before the remodeling, it could be said that only the lessee expected to gain from the improvements, and the district court did not err in denying a lien against lessor’s interest in the property. Idaho Lumber, Inc. v. Buck, 109 Idaho 737, 710 P.2d 647 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where lease gave lessee the right to make improvements, but did not give any corresponding right to lessor to require any particular improvement, it could not be said as a matter of law that the work done and materials furnished were made “at the instance of” the lessor.

        A time book is admissible in evidence for whatever it may show respecting the number of hours of labor and number of men who worked upon a building sought to be subjected to the lien; and an objection that it does not show the contractor’s time or material furnished is unavailing.

        Where a property owner secured a lien waiver from a subcontractor furnishing labor and materials for the construction of a dwelling and consideration for subcontractor’s execution of the lien waiver was the promise of payment in full, upon the failure of subcontractor to receive payment his purported waiver was of no effect.

       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of statute is to compensate anyone who performs labor upon, or furnishes, material to be used in construction, alteration, or repair of building or structure. Boise Payette Lbr. Co. v. Weaver, 40 Idaho 516, 234 P. 150 (1925).

        Although corporation is “a person” within statutory contemplation, it is not entitled to laborer’s lien within meaning of this section. Riggen v. Perkins, 42 Idaho 391, 246 P. 962 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words “every person who shall perform labor” designate ordinary laborers who perform actual physical toil and do not include that higher and better paid class of employees whose duties are confined to superintendence and management, unless such class is expressly mentioned in statute. Riggen v. Perkins, 42 Idaho 391, 246 P. 962 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a laborer is employed to be the superintendent and manager, in looking after, and taking care of, property and to plan, inspect and help with work when necessary, he and such labor come within the provisions of this section. White v. Constitution Min. & Milling Co., 56 Idaho 403, 55 P.2d 152 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to bring an action to collect compensation for work or labor performed and materials supplied in a construction project, the contractor must allege and prove that he was a duly registered contractor or exempt from registration at all times during the performance of such act or contract.

       <p>
        During the time an employee held himself in readiness to perform labor, although he may recover therefor, he cannot file a lien within the time required by law where that is the last work performed, and, since it is unlienable, it cannot be considered in determining the time within which a lien must be filed. Nelson v. Boise Petro. Corp., 54 Idaho 179, 32 P.2d 782 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        If an employer desires to keep a laborer in his employ, regardless of whether he is performing labor all the time or not, he may do so, but he cannot escape liability to pay wages during the time work is not being done. But because the employee is not employed in the performance of labor, as contemplated by the statute, he is not entitled to a lien to secure his wages during the time he is idle. Nelson v. Boise Petro. Corp., 54 Idaho 179, 32 P.2d 782 (1934).

        Under this section, it is necessary that the court determine the amount of land around the structure required for its convenient use and occupation and, therefore, subject to the lien; and where the court has so failed to do, the case will be remanded to the trial court with instructions to determine such amount of land and make proper findings.

        It is error for court in decreeing foreclosure of mechanic’s lien to fail to find amount of land necessary for the convenient use of the property to be sold. Robertson v. Moore, 10 Idaho 115, 77 P. 218 (1904), overruled on other grounds, Dover Lumber Co. v. Case, 31 Idaho 276, 170 P. 108 (1918); Dybvig v. Willis, 59 Idaho 160, 82 P.2d 95 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment of foreclosure was not sustained by evidence where findings of fact were based upon a surveyor’s report as to the amount of land necessary for convenient use of the barn but no testimony of the surveyor was taken at the trial in action brought by contractor for lien on barn, under this section ordering determination of land necessary for use and occupation of building. Mackey v. Eva, 80 Idaho 260, 328 P.2d 66 (1958).

        In an action to foreclose a mechanic’s lien for drilling a well, where defendant testified that he planned to use the water from the well for culinary use only and there was evidence that he planned to use it to irrigate his entire tract of ground, it was not error for the court to find that the entire tract was required for the convenient use and occupation of the well. Durfee v. Parker, 90 Idaho 118, 410 P.2d 962 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the court found work had been performed on 200 acres of land, indicating that the land had been benefited as a farming unit, the extent of the lien foreclosures on that land was not too broad in that the court failed to find what portion of the land was benefited. Weber v. Eastern Idaho Packing Corp., 94 Idaho 694, 496 P.2d 693 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a building is properly identified in the notice of claim of lien, a more general description of the land is sufficient, since the trial court has a reference point from which it may determine what land may be required for the convenient use of the building or structure; however, where there is no structure or one which has been inadequately identified, the notice of claim of lien must contain more particularized language in the description of the land in order to permit the court or interested third persons to identify the property against which the lien is asserted.

        In mechanic’s lien foreclosure where two judgment claimants assigned their judgments to another judgment claimant and heirs of deceased owner assigned their interest to same assignee so as to cause a merger of the liens with the title, an unassigned recorded judgment of another claimant is a cloud on the title which must be removed to render same marketable.

        The land upon which a lien may be asserted is expressly referenced to and made dependent upon the location of the building, structure or improvement; therefore, a lien may not be acquired against the land if one cannot be acquired against the building, structure or other improvement.

        A claim of lien is not invalid simply because it describes more property than is properly subject to the lien; so long as there is no fraudulent intent on the part of the lien claimant and no one is injured by the overly broad property description, the land properly subject to the lien is for the court to determine, after hearing all the evidence.

    Lien priority depends upon time that labor was commenced or materials were furnished by the claimant. Ultrawall, Inc. v. Washington Mut. Bank, 135 Idaho 832, 25 P.3d 855 (2001).

        Financial lender’s mortgages had priority over a landscape developer’s mechanics lien, because the developer’s priority date did not relate back to before the mortgages. Credit Suisse Ag v. Teufel Nursery, Inc., 156 Idaho 189, 321 P.3d 739 (2014).

        Lien of subcontractor, with respect to priority over mortgage, held to date back to time subcontractor began work and not to time principal contractor entered into contract. Boise-Payette Lumber Co. v. Halloran-Judge Trust Co., 281 F. 818 (9th Cir. 1922).

        The effective date of labor and materialmen’s liens is the date of commencement of the work or improvement or commencing to furnish material. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. First Security Bank, 94 Idaho 489, 491 P.2d 1261 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The priority date of a lien for materials is the date materials were commenced to be furnished; although the claim of lien is usually filed after all the materials have been furnished, the lien relates back to the date on which materials were first furnished by the claimant. The general rule is that such a lien does not attach unless and until the delivery of construction materials to the site. Beall Pipe & Tank Corp. v. Tumac Intermountain, Inc., 108 Idaho 487, 700 P.2d 109 (Ct. App. 1985).

        Claims of mechanics’ and materialmen’s liens filed under this chapter must be acknowledged in accord with<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c08s55-805" target="_blank">§ 55-805 </a></cite>before they are entitled to be recorded, and the “verification” required under this section does not serve the same purpose or function of an “acknowledgement” and cannot be a substitute therefor; accordingly, liens that were not acknowledged, or acknowledged but where the certificate of acknowledgement did not substantially comply with Title 55, Chapter 7 of the Idaho Code, were not enforceable against the bankruptcy trustee. Kloos v. Jacobson, 30 Bankr. 965 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Laborers and materialmen have the right to assert and obtain a lien which need not include an acknowledgement for it to be properly recorded against the property upon which they have performed labor or for which they have furnished materials.

        Where contractor’s mechanic’s lien stated only that he appeared, was duly sworn, and stated the contents of the lien, the lien did not satisfy the statutory requirements, and it was therefore invalid. Cornerstone Bldrs., Inc. v. McReynolds, 136 Idaho 843, 41 P.3d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).

        Upon the successful entry of a judgment of foreclosure of a lien claimed under this section, an award of attorney fees and costs is mandatory. The amount of the award, however, is still a matter of discretion for the district court. In determining the amount, the district court is free to consider the factors of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3) as well as those considerations which are part of a prevailing party analysis under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1)(B). Olsen v. Rowe, 125 Idaho 686, 873 P.2d 1340 (Ct. App. 1994). Discrepancy in Claim.
       </p>
       <p>
        A lien is not invalidated simply because the claimant is not entitled to the amount claimed due in the claim of lien, even when the discrepancy is substantial. And, if an error in the amount of the claim does not invalidate the lien, it would be incongruous to read into subsection (3) a provision invalidating the lien if the claimant does not state that all just credits and offsets had been deducted when calculating the amount of the demand.

        Where the real property description in a mechanic’s lien claim notice is “unambiguously erroneous” and describes with exactitude the wrong parcel of real property, substantial compliance with the statute is not achieved and the claim of lien is invalidated. Ross v. Olson, 95 Idaho 915, 523 P.2d 518 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the notice of claim of lien has a fatally defective description, there can be no valid lien and no foreclosure proceeding may be based on that notice of claim. Chief Indus., Inc. v. Schwendiman, 99 Idaho 682, 587 P.2d 823 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim of lien is not invalid simply because it describes more property than is properly subject to the lien; so long as there is no fraudulent intent on the part of the lien claimant and no one is injured by the overly broad property description, the land properly subject to the lien is for the court to determine, after hearing all the evidence. Beall Pipe & Tank Corp. v. Tumac Intermountain, Inc., 108 Idaho 487, 700 P.2d 109 (Ct. App. 1985).

       <p>
        In action involving contract dispute which arose from a remodeling project performed on a residential home by plaintiffs for defendants, lien waiver signed on June 17, 1992, applied only to claims of plaintiffs as of June 17, 1992, since it was found that substantial performance was not completed until June 22, the waiver did not extend to release defendants of any material and labor claims alleged by plaintiffs subsequent to June 17. Baker v. Boren, 129 Idaho 885, 934 P.2d 951 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action involving contract dispute which arose from a remodeling project that plaintiffs performed on residential property for defendants, lien waiver signed by plaintiffs and defendants did not hold defendants harmless from claims of subcontractors where remodeling project differed from other projects performed by plaintiffs for defendant in that in this project plaintiffs did not control or direct the subcontractors as they had in the past and defendants dealt directly with the subcontractors in that they paid several of these contractors directly and directed their work.

       <p>
        Where a materialman’s notice of claim of lien mentioned the materials supplied in general terms, but at no point did it specifically claim a lien against the materials or describe them adequately for identification, no lien could be sustained against the materials.

        Sufficiency of Notice.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Notice of lien must contain a direct and unequivocal allegation of name of owner; a notice headed “A and B, subcontractors and claimants, v. C, contractor, and D, owner,” is insufficient. White v. Mullins, 3 Idaho 434, 31 P. 801 (1892).
    Notice of claim of lien for construction of canal which states that a certain company is name of owner and is reputed owner of premises therein described, and caused the said canal to be constructed and excavated, is sufficient. Creer v. Cache Valley Canal Co., 4 Idaho 280, 38 P. 653 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mechanic’s lien for construction of canal need not charge or claim lien upon land or right of way. Creer v. Cache Valley Canal Co., 4 Idaho 280, 38 P. 653 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statement in lien notice that work was performed and materials furnished upon a certain mining claim, “the property of the defendant,” is not a sufficient compliance with this section. Steel v. Argentine Mining Co., 4 Idaho 505, 42 P. 585 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where work is done upon a group of placer mining claims owned by the same person and commonly known under the same name, description of claims under such common name, together with description of place of location, is sufficient in a notice of lien. Phillips v. Salmon River Mining & Dev. Co., 9 Idaho 149, 72 P. 886 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice of lien should contain statement of demand, name of owner or reputed owner, if known, name of person by whom employed, description of property and must be verified. Robertson v. Moore, 10 Idaho 115, 77 P. 218 (1904), overruled on other grounds, Dover Lumber Co. v. Case, 31 Idaho 276, 170 P. 108 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim of lien containing no recital of name of owner or person by whom laborer was employed, except recital that certain person was owner or reputed owner of premises, and “caused said labor” is insufficient. Riggen v. Perkins, 42 Idaho 391, 246 P. 962 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant’s failure to name the wife as well as the husband in its claim did not invalidate its lien against community real property. A substantial compliance in good faith meets the statutory requirement. Layrite Prods. Co. v. Lux, 86 Idaho 477, 388 P.2d 105 (1964).

        Time for Filing.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fact that it was not shown that claimant had ceased to perform his duties at time of filing of his claim for lien did not invalidate his claim. Idaho Mining & Milling Co. v. Davis, 123 F. 396 (9th Cir. 1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Materialman, who contracts direct with owner and has no privity of interest or contract with contractor, is an original contractor and entitled to time given to such contractors within which to file his lien. Colorado Iron Works v. Riekenberg, 4 Idaho 262, 38 P. 651 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Time for filing lien cannot be extended by furnishing on a new contract or requesting additional articles and adding them to a completed account and statement of material furnished. Valley Lbr. & Mfg. Co. v. Driessel, 13 Idaho 662, 93 P. 765 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        Materialman or laborer is given an absolute lien upon structure or improvement in which material was used or labor done if he files his claim of lien within time required by law, and payment by owner of the full contract price to contractor prior to date of filing of lien is no defense in action to foreclose such lien. Weeter Lbr. Co. v. Fales, 20 Idaho 255, 118 P. 289 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily furnishing article or performing service, trivial in character, is not sufficient to extend time for claiming lien, or revive expired lien, where article or service are available after substantial completion of contract, and article is not expressly required by terms thereof. H. W. Johns-Manville Co. v. Allen, 37 Idaho 153, 215 P. 840 (1923); Gem State Lbr. Co. v. Witty, 37 Idaho 489, 217 P. 1027 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lien of subcontractor must be filed within sixty [now ninety] days from date of completion of building or date of furnishing last item of material. H. W. Johns-Manville Co. v. Allen, 37 Idaho 153, 215 P. 840 (1923); Gem State Lbr. Co. v. Witty, 37 Idaho 489, 217 P. 1027 (1923).
    Notice of claim of well driller’s lien was held to be timely filed where notice was filed within 90 days of the sealing and capping of a completed well as the work of such sealing and capping was held not to be so minor or trivial as to be insufficient to extend the time within which to file a lien under this section. Craig H. Hisaw, Inc. v. Bishop, 95 Idaho 145, 504 P.2d 818 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trivial work done or materials furnished after a construction contract has been substantially completed will not extend the time in which a lien claim can be filed under this section. Mitchell v. Flandro, 95 Idaho 228, 506 P.2d 455 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence established that construction contract was substantially completed on November 10, 1964 and trial court found inadequate proof that any material or substantial work was performed or supplies furnished after that date which would extend the time for filing a mechanic’s lien, trial court correctly held that lien filed March 11, 1965 was not timely. Mitchell v. Flandro, 95 Idaho 228, 506 P.2d 455 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the sixty-day [now ninety-day] period provided by this section for the filing of mechanics’ liens cannot be extended or revised by the furnishing of trivial labor or material once the contract has been completed, a lien claimant must show that any additional materials or labor were actually used in constructing or repairing the structure and that they were necessary to complete construction according to terms of the contract. Pierson v. Sewell, 97 Idaho 38, 539 P.2d 590 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The time for filing a lien is not extended by performing a service, nor by furnishing an article, that is trivial in character, but remedying a defect in work or materials, at demand of a public inspector, will extend the time to file a lien. Barlow’s, Inc. v. Bannock Cleaning Corp., 103 Idaho 310, 647 P.2d 766 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering the timeliness of a lien filed by electrical subcontractor, the fact that property owner did not request final work performed at direction of the state electrical inspector was not dispositive, as the issue is not what the property owner requested, but whether the work in question was unnecessary or trivial. Barlow’s, Inc. v. Bannock Cleaning Corp., 103 Idaho 310, 647 P.2d 766 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The time for filing a lien starts to run when the claimant performs his last substantial work or makes his last substantial delivery of materials. Barlow’s, Inc. v. Bannock Cleaning Corp., 103 Idaho 310, 647 P.2d 766 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action involving a contract dispute which arose from a remodeling project that plaintiffs performed on residential home for defendants, lien filed August 20, 1992 was valid where there was substantial evidence that work performed between June 18 and 22nd was a substantial continuation of the work on the contract on which work was begun in March of 1992, where evidence showed that the work done between June 17 and June 22 was in furtherance of the existing contract and even though the work was not completed in 90 days as projects the parties had worked on in the past were generally completed, plaintiffs worked consistently from the time they undertook the project through June 22 and it was not a situation in which materials and services were rendered minimally in an attempt to prolong the filing date of the claim of lien. Baker v. Boren, 129 Idaho 885, 934 P.2d 951 (Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Building supplier’s materialman’s lien was timely where it was filed within 90 days of a contractor’s last order; strict materialmen, such as the building supplier, differed from builders who only furnished labor or labor and materials when analyzing substantial completion of contract under this section. Franklin Bldg. Supply Co. v. Sumpter, 139 Idaho 846, 87 P.3d 955 (2004).
    Where a builder bought materials from a supplier to use on defendants’ building project, the supplier was entitled to a lien on the buildings that the project produced because, inter alia, (1) the supplier did not receive full payment for the materials the supplier furnished for the construction of the project, (2) the lien was timely filed since an insulated storage building qualified as an “improvement” on the land, and (3) the verification of the supplier’s agent was not defective since the agent’s type-written name was sufficient. BMC West Corp. v. Horkley, 144 Idaho 890, 174 P.3d 399 (2007).

        Timely Amending of Claim.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since an original contractor must file a claim of lien no later than ninety days after the completion of the improvement, in the absence of statutory authorization, a defective claim of lien may not be amended after the statutory period for filing the claim has expired and although amendment of the complaint was permissible under the provisions of Idaho R. Civ. P. 15(b), such amendment could not remedy the fatal defect in the claim of lien based on an improvement completed a year previously. Ross v. Olson, 95 Idaho 915, 523 P.2d 518 (1974).

        The insertion of the legal description of the property involved by claimant’s attorney, done on the written instructions of claimant, before filing for record but after the verification by claimant, did not violate the verification requirement of the statute where the claim of lien as filed for record complied with the statute. Layrite Prods. Co. v. Lux, 86 Idaho 477, 388 P.2d 105 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the certificate of the president of the laborer materialman company recited that an oath had been administered and stated that the claim was believed to be true and just, and the notary public’s certificate attached thereto contained not merely a corporate acknowledgment but also a statement that the corporation’s president “did subscribe and swear to” the lien claim before the notary, the certificates, taken together, constituted a verification and satisfied the requirement of this section. Treasure Valley Plumbing & Heating, Inc. v. Earth Resources Co., 106 Idaho 920, 684 P.2d 322 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Verification by oath of the claimant, that his claim is “true”, rather that “just”, is not a material difference. Parkwest Homes LLC v. Barnson, 149 Idaho 603, 238 P.3d 203 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant’s agent’s signature before a notary is sufficient verification of the claim, even though it does not meet the exact form of a written oath set forth in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.51.html#t51c01s51-109" target="_blank">§ 51-109</a></cite>(2).

        Mechanic’s lien was invalid as a matter of law under this section, because, while a notary public acknowledged the lien, the notary did not certify that the person signing the lien had been sworn before the notary.

        During the time an employee held himself in readiness to perform labor, although he may recover therefor, he cannot file a lien within the time required by law where that is the last work performed, and since it is unlienable, it cannot be considered in determining the time within which a lien must be filed.

Accordingly, where materialman filed lien on property and second materialman filed foreclosure action in which first materialman was named as a defendant, and where the last day of the six-month limitation period fell on a Saturday, the time period was carried over to the next business day, pursuant to Idaho R. Civ. P. 6(a), and first materialman’s answer, counterclaim and cross-claim, which were filed on the following Monday, were timely. Cather v. Kelso, 103 Idaho 684, 652 P.2d 188 (1982).

        Based upon<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c02s1-212" target="_blank">§ 1-212</a></cite>, which recognizes the power of the Supreme Court to make procedural rules, and Idaho R. Civ. P. 6(a), which establishes the method for computing time periods, it is clear that the legislature and the Supreme Court were attempting to compensate for the closure of the clerk’s office on weekends and holidays and, in this regard, the time limitation contained in this section is analogous to a statute of limitation; when one considers the purpose of the rule and the statute the only interpretation is that Idaho R. Civ. P. 6(a) is applicable to this section. This interpretation permits the court clerk’s office to be closed on Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays without shortening the time established by the legislature within which the action must be filed; to hold otherwise, for all practical purposes, would result in a shortening of the statutory limitation period.

        A payment on account made and indorsed on the record of the lien within six months after the claim has been filed does, within the meaning of the statute, extend the duration of a lien covered by said statute for a period of six months after such payment. However, additional or successive payments on account, even though indorsed on the record of the lien, no matter when made, will not extend the duration of the lien beyond the six-month period following the first payment.

      § 45-512. Judgment to declare priority.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In every case in which different liens are asserted against any property, the court in the judgment must declare the rank of each lien or class of liens which shall be in the following order:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t45c05s45-512ol11">
       All laborers, other than contractors or subcontractors.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c05s45-512ol12">
       All materialmen including persons furnishing, renting or leasing equipment, materials or fixtures as defined in section 28-12-309, Idaho Code, other than contractors or subcontractors.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c05s45-512ol13">
       Subcontractors.

       The original contractor.

       All professional engineers and licensed surveyors.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      And in case the proceeds of sale under this chapter shall be insufficient to pay all lienholders under it:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. The liens of all laborers, other than the original contractor and subcontractor, shall first be paid in full, or pro rata if the proceeds be insufficient to pay them in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. The lien of materialmen including persons furnishing, renting or leasing equipment, materials or fixtures as defined in section 28-12-309, Idaho Code, other than the original contractor or subcontractor, shall be paid in full, or pro rata if the proceeds be insufficient to pay them in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Out of the remainder, if any, the subcontractors shall be paid in full, or pro rata if the remainder be insufficient to pay them in full, and the remainder, if any, shall be paid pro rata to the original contractor and the professional engineers and licensed surveyors; and each claimant shall be entitled to execution for any balance due him after such distribution; such execution to be issued by the clerk of the court upon demand, at the return of the sheriff or other officer making the sale, showing such balance due.

        To the extent that Idaho R. Civ. P 54, which requires the finding of a prevailing party within the discretion of the district court, is inconsistent with this section, which provides for a mandatory award of attorney fees as part of the enforcement of a lien, the rule has no application and does not modify the statute.

        Attorney’s fees are allowed in the foreclosure of mechanics’ and laborers’ liens. Robertson v. Moore, 10 Idaho 115, 77 P. 218 (1904), overruled on other grounds, Dover Lumber Co. v. Case, 31 Idaho 276, 170 P. 108 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees are not a part of the cost and, therefore, are recoverable, even though the amount of judgment is less than $100. Shaw v. Johnston, 17 Idaho 676, 107 P. 399 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s fees are an incident of the judgment and defendant is liable therefor. Smith v. Faris-Kesl Constr. Co., 27 Idaho 407, 150 P. 25 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        The omission of a part of the law adopted from California, to provide for attorney’s fees for work in the supreme court, is sufficient to show that it was the legislative intent not to adopt that part of the California law. Hendrix v. Gold Ridge Mines, Inc., 54 Idaho 326, 54 P.2d 254 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff filed suit to recover wages before wages were due but they were due at time of appeal the judgment in favor of plaintiff would not be reversed but that part of the judgment allowing attorney fees would be stricken. Schlueter v. Nelson, 74 Idaho 396, 263 P.2d 386 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff was entitled to attorney fee in suit to foreclose mechanic’s lien although he did not establish full amount of claim. Guyman v. Anderson (1954), 75 Idaho 294, 271 P.2d 1020.
    This section only authorizes district court to allow attorney fees for foreclosing liens. Ivie v. Peck, 94 Idaho 625, 495 P.2d 1110 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        This statute does not permit recovery of attorney fees on appeal by mechanic’s lien claimants. Weber v. Eastern Idaho Packing Corp., 94 Idaho 694, 496 P.2d 693 (1972), overruled on other grounds, Pierson v. Sewell, 97 Idaho 38, 539 P.2d 590 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to foreclose a mechanic’s lien brought by a subcontractor who furnished labor and materials in connection with the installation of a heating system in a dwelling, subcontractor’s attorney was not entitled to be awarded a fee for the time spent in preparing the mechanic’s lien. Pierson v. Sewell, 97 Idaho 38, 539 P.2d 590 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a contractor stipulated to release its materialmen’s lien upon condition that a sufficient sum of money would be held in a special account to pay any balance found to be due the contractor, the stipulation did not displace the contractor’s right to an attorney fee on his successful cross-claim against the property owners to foreclose his materialmen’s lien, since the cross-claim, seeking to recover from the special account fund, was the functional equivalent of an action to foreclose the lien. J.E.T. Dev. v. Dorsey Constr. Co., 102 Idaho 863, 642 P.2d 954 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the amount determined to be due a contractor under a construction contract was less than the amount claimed by the contractor in its notice of a materialmen’s lien did not bar recovery by the contractor of a statutory attorney fee under this section because a reasonable attorney fee was an incident of foreclosure of the lien. J.E.T. Dev. v. Dorsey Constr. Co., 102 Idaho 863, 642 P.2d 954 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both a general contractor and the landowner are responsible for the attorney fees incurred in legal proceedings to collect the claim of a materialmen’s lien. Acoustic Specialties, Inc. v. Wright, 103 Idaho 595, 651 P.2d 529 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the owners of the property retained the money due the principal contractor and, apparently without cause or right, contested the materialmen’s garnishment as well as foreclosure proceedings on every point, and litigated the case to the end, thereby delaying the materialmen in recovering on the partial summary judgments they were entitled to, and putting them to unnecessary legal expense, it was proper to allow the materialmen attorney fees payable out of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale of the owners’ real property. Acoustic Specialties, Inc. v. Wright, 103 Idaho 595, 651 P.2d 529 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has been interpreted by the Idaho Supreme Court to provide no basis for a successful lien claimant to receive attorney fees on appeal. However, these decisions do not insulate lien foreclosure cases from discretionary awards of attorney fees on appeal under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121</a></cite>. Therefore, where the appellate court has left with the abiding belief that an appeal was brought without foundation, it appropriately awarded attorney fees on appeal to the appellee. W.F. Constr.

Earth Resources Co., 115 Idaho 373, 766 P.2d 1254 (Ct. App. 1988).
    The trial court is free to consider all factors it deems as having a bearing on attorney fees in its determination of what is reasonable. Barber v. Honorof, 116 Idaho 767, 780 P.2d 89 (1989).

       <p>
        When a party successfully forecloses on a lien filed pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t45c05s45-507" target="_self">§ 45-507</a></cite>, that party is entitled to an award of the costs associated with the foreclosure pursuant to this section. Olsen v. Rowe, 125 Idaho 686, 873 P.2d 1340 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the successful entry of a judgment of foreclosure of a lien claimed under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t45c05s45-507" target="_self">§ 45-507</a></cite>, an award of attorney fees and costs is mandatory. The amount of the award, however, is still a matter of discretion for the district court. In determining the amount, the district court is free to consider the factors of Idaho R. Civ. P 54 as well as those considerations which are part of a prevailing party analysis under Idaho R. Civ. P 54. Olsen v. Rowe, 125 Idaho 686, 873 P.2d 1340 (Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiffs who claimed liens were not successful in their claims, and where neither out-of-state bond statutes nor the theory of unjust enrichment provided relief to any of them, awards of attorney fees to the plaintiffs were not appropriate. Great Plains Equip., Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., 132 Idaho 754, 979 P.2d 627 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the costs of filing and recording, as well as the attorney fees, are incidental to the foreclosure of a lien pursuant to this section, the award of attorney fees as part of the enforcement of the lien was a mandatory award. Elec. Wholesale Supply Co. v. Nielson, 136 Idaho 814, 41 P.3d 242 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although attorney fees on appeal by materialman’s lien claimants are not available pursuant to this section, an award could be made under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121 </a></cite>if the appeal was brought frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Franklin Bldg. Supply Co. v. Sumpter, 139 Idaho 846, 87 P.3d 955 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a builder bought materials from a supplier to use on defendants’ building project and the supplier was entitled to a lien on the buildings that the project produced, the supplier was entitled to costs and fees on appeal as the prevailing party. BMC West Corp. v. Horkley, 144 Idaho 890, 174 P.3d 399 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not allow the award of attorney fees on appeal by materialman’s lien claimants. Stonebrook Constr., LLC v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, 152 Idaho 927, 277 P.3d 374 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Materialmen foreclosing a lien could recover from subsequent buyers of the property the attorney fees reasonably incurred in responding to a lender’s attempts to prevent a foreclosure sale. It was immaterial whether the buyers had any responsibility for those costs being incurred. Magleby v. Garn, 154 Idaho 194, 296 P.3d 400 (2013).

        Materialmen foreclosing a lien could recover attorney fees on appeal from the builders under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120 </a></cite>where the issue on appeal was the amount of attorney fees awarded by the trial court, rather than the entitlement to an award. Attorney fees on appeal could not be awarded under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121</a></cite>, however, because this section applied instead.

        After prevailing in a mechanic’s lien foreclosure action, a trustee’s sale buyer could not recover attorney fees on appeal from the builder under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§§ 12-120</a></cite>(3) and 12-121 because the more specific statute governing attorney fees in an action to foreclose a mechanic’s lien, this section, does not provide for fees on appeal. Parkwest Homes, LLC v. Barnson, 154 Idaho 678, 302 P.3d 18 (2013).
    District court did not err in apportioning a landscape developer’s costs and attorney’s fees by finding that the developer only partially prevailed in litigation to determine priority between the developer’s mechanics lien and a financial lender’s mortgages. Credit Suisse Ag v. Teufel Nursery, Inc., 156 Idaho 189, 321 P.3d 739 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of an award of attorney’s fees for failure to plead a specific amount, as required by Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure, is not inconsistent with the mandatory award language in this section. Regdab, Inc. v. Graybill, 165 Idaho 293, 444 P.3d 323 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendants relied on plaintiff’s complaint and its failure to contain a specific amount for attorney fees in making the decision not to defend the suit and actually tendered payment in full before the default judgment was entered, defendants would have been prejudiced if plaintiff was permitted to amend its complaint, adding a specific amount of attorney fees on default. Regdab, Inc. v. Graybill, 165 Idaho 293, 444 P.3d 323 (2019).

        This section does not violate the guarantee of equal protection of the law by allowing attorney fees to the lienor but not allowing them to the property owner successfully resisting lien foreclosure nor by singling out and penalizing a single class of debtors.

        In an action to foreclose a mechanic’s lien, the court properly joined all parties claiming liens against the same property. Brown v. Hawkins, 66 Idaho 351, 158 P.2d 840 (1945).

       <p>
        In lien foreclosure where all parties claiming same were joined in same action and, after judgment, two claimants assigned their judgments to another claimant and the heirs of deceased owner assigned their interest to the same assignee, the legal title to the property was then merged in assignee unless such merger would cause injustice to a junior lien.

        This section allows the materialman lien claimant to collect the debt both through foreclosure of the lien and a personal action against the contractor. Accordingly, the fact that the subcontractor materialmen had not yet reduced to judgment their claims for attorney fees against the principal contractor did not prevent their obtaining a judgment for those fees against the owners of the real property.

        Defendant’s contention that this chapter violates the contract clause of the United States Constitution was without merit; the constitutional impairment of contract clause protects only those contractual obligations already in existence at the time the disputed law is enacted, and Idaho’s wage claim act was first passed in 1893, well before the obligation in question.

        By using the term “employee,” the legislature indicated that the provisions of this chapter should apply only to employees, not independent contractors. Ostrander v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 123 Idaho 650, 851 P.2d 946 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        When determining whether there exists an employee/employer relationship for the purpose of Idaho’s wage claim statute, it is not the labels applied by the parties which control, but rather the actual indicia of such a relationship; the general test of an employee/employer relationship is the right to control work, and if the employer retains the right to control and to direct the activities of the employee in the details of work performed, and to determine the hours to be spent and the times to start and stop the work, the person performing work will be deemed an employee. State ex rel. Dep’t of Labor & Indus. Servs. v. Hill, 118 Idaho 278, 796 P.2d 155 (Ct. App. 1990).

        The 1967 amendment to Idaho’s claim for wages statutes was not intended to change the rule enunciated by previous cases which stopped the running of penalties upon a tender of the full amount of wages due. Gano v. Air Idaho, Inc., 99 Idaho 720, 587 P.2d 1255 (1978).

        The purpose of the wage and hour law is to ensure that employees receive compensation due to them upon termination of their employment. De Witt v. Medley, 117 Idaho 744, 791 P.2d 1323 (Ct. App. 1990).

        Where an employer was preparing to sell a division of his company within 60 days and promised his employee a bonus of 60 days’ additional salary if the employee would remain with the company until the division was sold, such 60-day “pay bonus” was a wage, as defined in this section; thus, employer’s refusal to pay such bonus subjected the employer to treble damages under former law. Neal v. Idaho Forest Indus., Inc., 107 Idaho 681, 691 P.2d 1296 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action for breach of employment contract, it was error for the trial judge to treat the cash value of the life insurance policy as wages, where the proceeds of the policy were to be paid to the employee at retirement or to his heirs upon his death. The policy was a fixed benefit of employment status, and as such, it was not compensation earned in increments as services were performed, unlike wages, and also unlike compensation paid in direct consideration of services rendered, in amounts over and above an employee’s regular paychecks. Whitlock v. Haney Seed Co., 114 Idaho 628, 759 P.2d 919 (Ct. App. 1988).
    Funds held in a deferral account were “wages” under this section, where the funds were compensation earned in increments as services were performed and the funds were fully earned by the employee when placed in the account, and the fact that there was or could be a balance in the account when the employee terminated his employment did not mean the account was intended as a retirement or similar post-employment benefit. Bilow v. Preco, Inc., 132 Idaho 23, 966 P.2d 23 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly affirmed an arbitration panel’s refusal to award treble damages and attorney fees on an employee’s employment agreement claim because the panel did not rule that the amount owed on the employment agreement claim constituted monies owed for unpaid wages. The arbitrators awarded the employee damages under the heading of “Wage Claim,” but the mere use of that shorthand term did not suggest the panel intended the award to represent wages; instead, those damages were part of a liquidated damages provision as articulated in the employment agreement. Moore v. Omnicare, Inc., 141 Idaho 809, 118 P.3d 141 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a wrongful discharge case in which an employee claimed he was fired for petitioning to exercise stock options granted to him by the employer, the United States court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit requested the Idaho supreme court to accept certification of a question asking whether stock options can be wages under this section. Paolini v. Albertson’s Inc., 418 F.3d 1023 (9th Cir. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stock options do not fall under the definition of wages because that form of compensation is not payable in cash, with a check, or by deposit into an employee’s bank account. Paolini v. Albertson’s, Inc., 143 Idaho 547, 149 P.3d 822 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in ruling that the amount owed under a noncompetition/nondisclosure agreement was not wages under subsection (7), where the 12 months’ pay provided for in the agreement was not conditioned on compliance with the noncompetition conditions, but was severance pay intended to compensate for past service and to secure economic well-being. Huber v. Lightforce USA, Inc., 159 Idaho 833, 367 P.3d 228 (2016).

     <p>
      In cases of executions, attachments and writs of similar nature, issued against any person or his property, except for claims for labor done, any employee who has claims against the defendant for labor done upon the property levied on, may give notice of their claim and the amount thereof, sworn to by the person making the claim, to the creditor or the creditor’s agent or attorney and to the officer executing any of such writs, at any time before the actual sale of the property levied upon; and, unless such claim is disputed by the debtor or creditor, such officer must pay to such person out of the proceeds of the sale of any property on which such person has bestowed labor, the amount such person is entitled to receive for his services rendered within the sixty (60) days preceding the levy of the writ. If any or all other claims so presented and claiming preference under this section are disputed by either the debtor or a creditor, the person presenting the same must commence an action within ten (10) days for the recovery thereof, and must prosecute the action with due diligence or be forever barred from any claim of priority of payment thereof, and the officer shall retain possession of so much of the proceeds of the sale as may be necessary to satisfy such claim until the determination of such action, and in case judgment be had for the claim or any part thereof, carrying costs, the costs taxable therein shall likewise be a preferred claim with the same rank as the original claim.

        In order to come within terms of former similar law, complainant must have been discharged. Marrs v. Oregon Short Line R.R., 33 Idaho 785, 198 P. 468 (1920); Goodell v. Pope-Shenon Mining Co., 36 Idaho 427, 212 P. 342 (1922).

        Former section set forth two separate situations where recovery is allowed. Under the first alternative, wages or salary are due an employee at the time the employer discharges or lays off that employee. In the second alternative, the employee need not be discharged or laid off by their employer. The employee simply has to make a demand for wages or salary due and owing to him under his contract of employment. Kalac v. Canyon County, 119 Idaho 650, 809 P.2d 511 (Ct. App. 1990). Attorney Fees.

        A demand in writing for wages due as required by former section was made as shown by the record in action for wages with the notification that if payment was not received within five days and suit was thereafter brought, attorney fees and penalty would be sought as provided in this section and upon action being thus brought, attorneys fees in the amount of $700 were stipulated and agreed upon.

        It was not the intention of legislature to penalize employer for failing to pay an unjust debt, nor for failure to pay when discharged laborer, after demanding payment, prevents compliance with demand by his own conduct, nor to deny or preclude right of employer to interpose any valid counterclaim or defense to claim of such laborer. Olson v. Idora Hill Mining Co., 28 Idaho 504, 155 P. 291 (1916); Goodell v. Pope-Shenon Mining Co., 36 Idaho 427, 212 P. 342 (1922).

        It was the purpose of former similar law to impose penalty upon employer in case of his failure to pay employee wages earned when due, after proper demand has been made therefor. Robinson v.

       <p>
        In a wrongful discharge case in which an employee claimed he was fired for petitioning to exercise stock options granted to him by the employer, the United States court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit requested the Idaho supreme court to accept certification of a question asking whether stock options can be wages. Paolini v. Albertson’s Inc., 418 F.3d 1023 (9th Cir. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stock options do not fall under the definition of wages because that form of compensation is not payable in cash, with a check, or by deposit into an employee’s bank account. Paolini v. Albertson’s, Inc., 143 Idaho 547, 149 P.3d 822 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly granted summary judgment based on a wrongful discharge claim under Idaho’s wage laws as the facts, which involved the denial of accelerated vesting with respect to stock options, did not support a wrongful discharge claim because stock options did not constitute wages. Paolini v. Albertson’s Inc., 482 F.3d 1149 (9th Cir. 2007).

      Any person shall have the right to collect wages, penalties and liquidated damages provided by any law or pursuant to a contract of employment, but any action thereon shall be filed either with the department or commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction within two (2) years after the cause of action accrued, provided, however, that in the event salary or wages have been paid to any employee and such employee claims additional salary, wages, penalties or liquidated damages, because of work done or services performed during his employment for the pay period covered by said payment, any action therefor shall be commenced within twelve (12) months from the accrual of the cause of action. It is further provided that if any such cause of action has accrued prior to the effective date of this act, and is not barred by existing law, action thereon may be commenced within six (6) months from the effective date of this act.

        Claims for Additional Salary.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The proviso in the first sentence of this section refers to a claim for additional salary for a specific pay period from which an employee has already received some payment of salary or wages; the term pay period does not refer to the entire course of an employment relationship. Johnson v. Allied Stores Corp., 106 Idaho 363, 679 P.2d 640 (1984).

        Jurors should have been instructed by the court as to whether defendant’s first four payments to plaintiff constituted payment of wages for the pay periods covered by such payments and whether the action by plaintiff was for additional wages claimed for those pay periods and consequently was barred by the 6-months [now 12-months] provision; the jurors should have been instructed if they found the first four payments were on account as claimed by plaintiff, then his action was not barred but if such payments were made in the manner claimed by defendant, then the action as to the four pay periods was barred. Anderson v. Lee, 86 Idaho 220, 386 P.2d 54 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employment agreement which set an agreed hourly wage was indefinite as to duration and time for payment of wages, it was a question of fact whether employer’s first four payments constituted wages for the pay periods, so as to render employee’s action for additional wages claimed for those four pay periods barred by the six-month [now twelve-month] statute of limitations; and jurors should have been so instructed. Anderson v. Lee, 86 Idaho 300, 386 P.2d 54 (1963).

        Where, more than six months but less than two years after his employment was terminated, employee brought action against employer for wages, and employer counterclaimed and alleged action was barred by statute of limitations under this section, whether payments made by employer were for all work up to each respective payment and made the six-month [now twelve-month] statute of limitations on additional wage claims applicable, or whether they were on account, for no particular period, making the limitation statute inapplicable, were issues of fact.

        Where the school district could have compensated the employee for his overtime work any time during the term of his contract, it was not until that contract expired that his cause of action then accrued, for it is only then that he knew that he would not be compensated for the unpaid overtime. Gilbert v. Moore, 108 Idaho 165, 697 P.2d 1179 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the longstanding practice of the county was to pay all overtime accrued upon termination, and the sheriff’s action was filed within one month of his termination of employment, the county’s assertion of the defense of failure to file within the statutory period was without merit.

        Partner’s claim for “unpaid additional wages” was subject to the six-month [now twelve-month] limitation period expressed in this section. Callenders, Inc. v. Beckman, 120 Idaho 169, 814 P.2d 429 (Ct. App. 1991). Severance Pay.
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim for severance pay is a component of the compensation in an employment agreement since severance pay is not a mere gratuity; thus, a claim for severance pay comes within the parameters of this section. Johnson v. Allied Stores Corp., 106 Idaho 363, 679 P.2d 640 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because severance pay is not attributed to, or earned in a specific pay period, but, is earned over the entire course of the employment relationship, the six-month [now twelve-month] limitation period is inapplicable to a claim for severance pay; rather, the two-year period is applicable. Johnson v. Allied Stores Corp., 106 Idaho 363, 679 P.2d 640 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee had a right to collect his severance pay upon either his retirement or involuntary termination and where suit for severance pay was initiated less than two years from employee’s involuntary termination, the claim was not barred by the two-year limitation period.

        If the payments made by defendant were on account as claimed by plaintiff employee, then no particular pay period was covered by such payments, and the six-month [now twelve-month] limitation for commencing suit would not apply because in such case plaintiff would not be claiming additional wages for the pay period covered by any of the payments made; his claim, in that case, would be for an unpaid balance applicable to the entire period of his employment, but if, on the other hand, such four payments were to cover the full amount earned by plaintiff up to the time of making the payments, plaintiff’s action would be barred by the six-months [now twelve-months] provision. Anderson v. Lee, 86 Idaho 220, 386 P.2d 54 (1963).

       <p>
        Where one was employed from calendar year to calendar year at a fixed salary with a bonus of 25% of profits of business at end of each calendar year and was wrongfully discharged in February, the claim for salary to the end of the year and the bonus for such year was governed by the two-year limitation and not the six-month [now twelve-month] limitation.

        With respect to his claim for $23,077 of unpaid wages, for which he received treble damages, a former corporation employee was entitled to attorney fees incurred below and on appeal. The employee was not entitled to attorney fees for the remainder of the claims he had raised on appeal. Maroun v. Wyreless Sys., 141 Idaho 604, 114 P.3d 974 (2005).

        District court did not abuse its discretion in the amount of attorney fees it awarded to a former COO, where it applied the correct legal standard, analyzed each of the factors set forth in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3), significantly reduced the number of hours billed by the COO’s legal team on the grounds that the amount of billed time was shocking, factored in the company’s discovery abuses and the delay due to the company’s bankruptcy, and considered the fact that the COO had to defend against counter-claims that the company eventually abandoned.

       <p>
        Pursuant to this section, the district court erred by not trebling the unpaid wage amount of $23,077 in the stipulated judgment because both parties conceded that the corporation owed $23,077 in unpaid wages and the employee had incurred the expense of instituting a lawsuit to recover his unpaid salary and that was the harm treble damages were intended to deter. Maroun v. Wyreless Sys., 141 Idaho 604, 114 P.3d 974 (2005).
    District court properly affirmed an arbitration panel’s refusal to award treble damages and attorney fees on an employee’s employment agreement claim because the panel did not rule that the amount owed on the employment agreement claim constituted monies owed for unpaid wages. The arbitrators awarded the employee damages under the heading of “Wage Claim,” but the mere use of that shorthand term did not suggest the panel intended the award to represent wages; instead, those damages were part of a liquidated damages provision as articulated in the employment agreement. Moore v. Omnicare, Inc., 141 Idaho 809, 118 P.3d 141 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Future wages are not subject to the mandatory trebling provision of the Idaho wage claim act. In distinguishing between future wages and those subject to the act, the question is whether the employee is entitled to the wages for services rendered, or whether there is more that she must do in order to be entitled to the wages.

        In order to proceed with a wage collection, the department of labor and industrial services [now department of labor] must determine whether wages are due and owing to the claimant; inherent in making such a determination is the department’s resolution of whether the parties maintained an employer/employee relationship, as such a relationship is a necessary subsidiary fact which must be established before the department may proceed; accordingly, the department is authorized to make that preliminary determination.

       Once a wage claim has been properly filed with the department, the provisions of this section shall provide the exclusive remedy for resolving the wage claim. If at any time after the filing of the wage claim the department determines that it lacks jurisdiction over the wage claim, the department shall provide written notification of its determination to the claimant and the employer. The claimant may then assert the wage claim in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event the department determines that it lacks jurisdiction over the wage claim, the limitation periods provided for in section 45-614, Idaho Code, shall be tolled from the date the wage claim was filed with the department until the date notice that the department lacks jurisdiction is mailed to the claimant, as provided in subsection (5) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c06s45-617ol14">
       A department compliance officer shall examine wage claims filed with the department and, on the basis of the facts found, shall determine whether the wage claimant is entitled to an award for unpaid wages and penalties. If the compliance officer is unable to determine whether wages and penalties are owed, the claim may be referred to a hearing officer for a determination. The department may adjust the amount of penalties awarded for an employer’s failure to comply with the requirements of section 45-606, Idaho Code. The department may award no penalty, or may award a penalty in any amount up to the maximum amount allowed under section 45-607, Idaho Code. No penalty shall be awarded by the department unless a specific finding is made that wages were withheld willfully, arbitrarily and without just cause. The department’s determination shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law. Before the determination becomes final or an appeal is filed, the compliance or hearing officer that issued the determination may, on their own motion, issue a revised determination. The determination or revised determination shall become a final determination unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an appeal is filed by the claimant or the employer with the department. If an appeal is not timely filed, the amount awarded by a final determination shall become immediately due and payable to the department. A final determination may be enforced by the department in accordance with section 45-618, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c06s45-617ol15">
       The claimant and the employer shall be entitled to prompt service of notice of determinations and decisions. A notice shall be deemed served if delivered to the person being served or if mailed to his last known address. Service by mail shall be deemed complete on the date of mailing. The date indicated on department determinations or decisions as the “date of mailing” shall be presumed to be the date the document was deposited in the United States mail, unless otherwise shown by a preponderance of competent evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c06s45-617ol16">
       An appeal from a wage claim determination shall be in writing, signed by the appellant or the appellant’s representative and shall contain words that, by fair interpretation, request the appeal process for a specific determination of the department. The appeal may be filed by personal delivery, by mail, or by fax to the wage and hour section of the department at the address indicated on the wage claim determination. The date of personal delivery shall be noted on the appeal and shall be deemed the date of filing. If mailed, the appeal shall be deemed to be filed on the date of mailing as determined by the postmark. A faxed appeal that is received by the wage and hour section by 5:00 p.m. on a business day shall be deemed filed on that date. A faxed appeal that is received by the wage and hour section on a weekend, holiday or after 5:00 p.m. on a business day shall be deemed filed on the next business day.
    (7) To hear and decide appeals from determinations, the director shall appoint appeals examiners who have been specifically trained to hear wage claims. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, the appeals examiner shall affirm, modify, set aside or reverse the determination involved, after affording the claimant and the employer reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, or may refer a matter back to the compliance or hearing officer for further action. The appeals examiner shall notify the claimant and the employer of his decision by serving notice in the same manner as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The decision shall set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law. The appeals examiner may, either upon application for rehearing by the claimant, the employer, or on his own motion, rehear, affirm, modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evidence previously submitted or on the basis of additional evidence; provided, that such application or motion be made within ten (10) days after the date of service of the decision. A complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with an appealed wage claim. All testimony at any hearing shall be recorded. Witnesses subpoenaed by the appeals examiner shall be allowed fees at a rate prescribed by the director. If the claimant or the employer formally requests the appeals examiner to issue a subpoena for a witness whose evidence is deemed necessary, the appeals examiner shall promptly issue the subpoena, unless such request is determined to be unreasonable. Unless the claimant or the employer, within fourteen (14) days after service of the decision of the appeals examiner, seeks judicial review pursuant to section 45-619, Idaho Code, or unless an application or motion is made for a rehearing of such decision, the decision of the appeals examiner shall become final and the amount awarded by the decision shall become immediately due and payable to the department. A decision that has become final may be enforced by the department according to section 45-618, Idaho Code.

        Award Beyond Damages.

       <p>
        When a statute allows an award beyond actual damages, the court must decide whether the award is intended to be a penalty or compensation. If it is intended to be a penalty, the statute’s requirements must be strictly construed; if it is intended to be compensatory, the statutory requirements are not to be strictly construed. Barth v. Canyon County, 128 Idaho 707, 918 P.2d 576 (1996).

        In action for breach of employment contract, it was error for the trial judge to treat the cash value of the life insurance policy as wages, where the proceeds of the policy were to be paid to the employee at retirement or to his heirs upon his death. The policy was a fixed benefit of employment status, and, as such, it was not compensation earned in increments as services were performed, unlike wages, and also unlike compensation paid in direct consideration of services rendered, in amounts over and above an employee’s regular paychecks.

        In order to recover treble damages, it need not be shown that an employer withholding wages acted with malice, wantonness, fraud or oppression, but it must be shown that the wages were wrongfully withheld. Gano v. Air Idaho, Inc., 99 Idaho 720, 587 P.2d 1255 (1978).
    The liability of the employer for treble damages was not dependent upon a finding that the employer “wrongfully” withheld the wages due; the employee only had to show that his wages were due and unpaid. Smith v. Idaho Peterbilt, Inc., 106 Idaho 846, 683 P.2d 882 (Ct. App. 1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        A tender of part of the wages ultimately found due should stop the running of the treble damages penalty as to the portion of the wages reflected by the tender, where such a partial tender is made unconditionally to the employee. Only if the tender is made in fact and rejected will the employer be completely protected from the invocation of the penalty statute. Smith v. Idaho Peterbilt, Inc., 106 Idaho 846, 683 P.2d 882 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A pre-complaint offer of wages to employees must take the form of an actual tender in order to escape liability by the employer for the treble damage penalty. Hales v. King, 114 Idaho 916, 762 P.2d 829 (Ct. App. 1988).

        In suit for wages wrongfully withheld, treble damages must have been awarded whenever it was proved that the wages have been wrongfully withheld. Goff v. H.J.H. Co., 95 Idaho 837, 521 P.2d 661 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the status of public officer cannot serve to exempt him from a duty to mitigate, while, at the same time, allowing him the benefits of a statute designed to protect wage earners who do have such a duty, an award of damages to a police chief who was wrongfully discharged could not be trebled. Buckalew v. City of Grangeville, 100 Idaho 460, 600 P.2d 136 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employer was preparing to sell a division of his company within 60 days and promised his employee a bonus of 60 days’ additional salary if the employee would remain with the company until the division was sold, such 60-day “pay bonus” was a wage; thus, employer’s refusal to pay such bonus subjected the employer to treble damages. Neal v. Idaho Forest Indus., Inc., 107 Idaho 681, 691 P.2d 1296 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        To recover treble damages, a showing of wrongfulness was not required; neither was it necessary to show bad faith on the part of the employer. Sage v. Richtron, Inc., 108 Idaho 837, 702 P.2d 875 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the deputy sheriff was not entitled to salary as an incident of his right to his office, and his status was as “employee at will,” he was entitled to recover treble damages. Schoonover v. Bonner County, 113 Idaho 916, 750 P.2d 95 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action for breach of employment contract, there was no procedural error in the trial judge’s decision to apply treble damages, even though it was not pleaded by either party, nor was it otherwise raised as an issue at trial, where the complaint prayed for monetary relief from breach of an employment contract, and this was sufficient to place the employer on notice that unpaid wages, or items analogous to wages, could be awarded. Whitlock v. Haney Seed Co., 114 Idaho 628, 759 P.2d 919 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action for breach of employment contract, the employee was entitled to prejudgment interest only on the untrebled portion of the vacation pay due him because the additional amount produced by trebling became “due” only when judgment was entered. Whitlock v. Haney Seed Co., 114 Idaho 628, 759 P.2d 919 (Ct. App. 1988).
    A deferral account, the purpose of which was to provide an executive employee with income even when the employer did not produce a pre-tax profit for the month, was not an agreement within the scope of ERISA and was subject to trebling under this section.

       <p>
        A vendor’s lien is not a specific and absolute charge on the realty but a mere equitable right to resort to it, i.e., the property, on failure of payment by the vendee; thus, even if a judgment debtor did possess a vendor’s lien in certain property he sold, he possessed no interest in the property which could be levied upon pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.08.html#t08c05s8-539" target="_blank">§ 8-539 </a></cite>by the judgment creditor.

        A vendor’s lien, like a mortgage, is a security device, but unlike a mortgage, which arises from agreement of the parties, a vendor’s lien arises by operation of law, unless waived. Quintana v. Anthony, 109 Idaho 977, 712 P.2d 678 (Ct. App. 1985).

        The legislative policies underlying the mortgage foreclosure statutes should guide the court’s exercise of its equitable powers when enforcing a vendor’s lien. Therefore, protections paralleling those given mortgagors are appropriate and may be provided in equity, where sellers of real property assert the existence of vendors’ liens. Quintana v.

        Where person sells real estate to married man and conveys same by good and sufficient deed, and takes as part of purchase price promissory notes executed by vendee and vendee’s wife, the signature of wife to such notes does not constitute such security as will amount to a waiver of vendor’s lien.

        A party with a vendor’s lien does not waive the right to that lien by seeking an attachment of the property; however, an attachment would not be valid and any rights to the property would be determined by the existing security interest.

        “Good faith” in this section means lack of actual or constructive knowledge of the applicable lien. Benz v. D. L. Evans Bank, 152 Idaho 215, 268 P.3d 1167 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was error against a lienholder, who claimed that he was owed $20,000 that he had paid toward the purchase of real property, in favor of a subsequent buyer of the property who had notice of the earlier claim, even if the subsequent buyer questioned the validity of the claim. The buyer was not a good faith purchaser. Cuevas v. Barraza, 152 Idaho 890, 277 P.3d 337 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        To claim a vendor’s lien against a bank, foreclosing on another debt against the buyer of the property, the landowner/seller must prove that the bank was not an encumbrancer in good faith, e.g., having some notice that the purchase price for the land remained unpaid. Harris v. Bank of Commerce, 154 Idaho 356, 298 P.3d 1060 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, vendor’s liens are subject only to encumbrancers in good faith. Good faith means lack of actual or constructive knowledge of any existing lien. Constructive knowledge is knowledge of such facts and circumstances as would have led to the discovery of a purchase and conveyance by a reasonably prudent man. Constructive knowledge is derived from the record at the time of the encumbrance. The presence of either constructive or actual knowledge of an existing lien is sufficient to subordinate the second encumbrance to the existing lien. Union Bank, N.A. v. N. Idaho Resorts, LLC, 161 Idaho 583, 388 P.3d 907 (2017).

        Where, before the bank made a construction loan to the seller of a property, the bank had actual knowledge that the seller had contracted to sell the property and that the buyer had paid a portion of the purchase price, the bank had actual knowledge of the facts that gave rise to the buyer having a vendee’s lien upon the seller acquiring the real property, and the bank could not claim priority over that lien.

        The amount that a vendee is entitled to recover back under a lien is the total amount paid on the purchase price, less any sum that the vendor is entitled to offset against that amount as damages that the vendor is entitled to recover as a result of the transaction, such as the reasonable rental value of the land while the vendee was in possession.

        Summary judgment was error against a lienholder, who claimed that he was owed $20,000 that he had paid toward the purchase of real property, in favor of a subsequent buyer of the property who had notice of the earlier claim, even if the subsequent buyer questioned the validity of the claim. The lien was legally created by this section. Cuevas v. Barraza, 152 Idaho 890, 277 P.3d 337 (2012).

        There was evidence that a buyer’s vendee’s lien was created before the bank’s deed of trust attached to the property because it was undisputed that before the bank made the construction loan to the seller, the bank had actual knowledge that the seller had contracted to sell the property and that the buyer had paid a portion of the purchase price. The bank had actual knowledge of the facts that gave rise to the buyer having a vendee’s lien, upon the seller acquiring the real property. Benz v. D. L.

         Every person who, while lawfully in possession of an article of personal property, renders any service to the owner thereof, by labor, or skill, employed for the protection, improvement, safekeeping, or carriage thereof, has a special lien thereon, dependent on possession, for the compensation, if any, which is due him from the owner, for such service. If the liens as herein provided are not paid within sixty (60) days after the work is done, service rendered or materials supplied, the person in whose favor such special lien is created may proceed to sell the property at a public auction after giving ten (10) days’ public notice of the sale by advertising in some newspaper published in the county where the property is situated, or if there is no newspaper published in the county then by posting notices of the sale in three (3) of the most public places in the county for ten (10) days previous to such sale. The person shall also send the notice of auction to the owner or owners of the property and to the holder or holders of a perfected security interest in the property as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The person who is about to render any service to the owner of an article of personal property by labor or skill employed for the protection, improvement, safekeeping or carriage thereof may take priority over a prior perfected security interest by, before commencing any such service, giving notice of the intention to render such service to any holder of a prior perfected security interest at least three (3) days before rendering such service. If the holder of the security interest does not notify said person, within three (3) days that it does not consent to the performance of such services, then the person rendering such service may proceed and the lien provided for herein shall attach to the property as a superior lien. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a motor vehicle subject to the provisions of sections 49-1809 through 49-1818, Idaho Code.

    Although the farmer argued that the family did not properly foreclose their lien because they did not follow the statutory procedure prescribed by subsection (b) for selling the cattle, the family did not sell the cattle, however, the county did; although a lien dependent on possession was lost if the holder of the lien voluntarily relinquished possession of the property or restored it to the owner, the family did not do so as it was the county, in the exercise of its police power, that took the cattle from the family’s dairy.

       <p>
        Any person, firm or corporation, who makes, alters or repairs any article of personal property, at the request of the owner or person in legal possession thereof, has a lien, which said lien shall be superior and prior to any security interest in the same for his reasonable charges for work done and materials furnished, and may retain possession of the same until the charges are paid. If not paid within two (2) months after the work is done, the person, firm or corporation may proceed to sell the property at public auction, by giving ten (10) days’ public notice of the sale by advertising in some newspaper published in the county in which the work was done; or, if there be no newspaper published in the county, then by posting up notices of the sale in three (3) public places in the town where the work was done, for ten (10) days previous to the sale. The proceeds of the sale must be applied to the discharge of the lien and the cost of keeping and selling the property; the remainder, if any, must be paid over to the owner thereof. Provided that the said person, firm or corporation who is about to make, alter or repair the said property, in order to derive the benefits of this section, must, before commencing said making, altering or repairing, give notice of the intention to so make, alter or repair said property, by registered mail, to any holder of a security interest which is of record in the county where said property is located, or in the office of the secretary of state, and, if a motor vehicle, to any holder of a security interest which may appear on the certificate of title of said vehicle, at least three (3) days before commencing said making, altering or repairing and if notice in writing within said three (3) days be not given by such holder of a security interest notifying said firm or corporation not to perform said services then the said making, altering or repairing may proceed and the prior lien provided for herein attaches to said property.

        Bank lost possession of funds when it turned them over to the trustee, and, having done so, it was obligated to take prompt action, including filing a motion for relief from the automatic stay and requesting adequate protection, to preserve its possessory lien rights, but it failed to do so. Because it lacked possession of the funds, and it had unnecessarily delayed asserting its rights, the bank could not seek a banker’s lien upon the funds the trustee held.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any cooperative corporation, as defined by Idaho Code, which provides goods or services to any person, firm or corporation, may set off any equity interest owned by such person, firm or corporation in the cooperative as a means of collecting obligations owed to it for such goods or services. Equity shall include, but not be limited to, membership stock, capital credits, accounts representing capital credits, capital stock or patronage credits. The cooperative shall have a lien on and a continuing perfected security interest in such equity to secure payment of any indebtedness, whenever incurred, owed to the cooperative by the person, firm or corporation receiving goods or services. Such lien and continuing perfected security interest may be enforced by right of offset when it becomes due and payable under the articles or bylaws of the cooperative. The cooperative’s right of offset shall not entitle the debtor to set off its obligations against equity interest it owns in the cooperative which are not yet an obligation of the cooperative payable under the article or bylaws of the cooperative.

       Whenever a homeowner’s association levies an assessment against a lot for the reasonable costs incurred in the maintenance of common areas consisting of real property owned and maintained by the association, the association, upon complying with subsection (2) of this section, shall have a lien upon the individual lot for such unpaid assessments accrued in the previous twelve (12) months.

         When a claim has been filed and recorded pursuant to this section and the owner of the lot subject to the claim thereafter fails to pay any assessment chargeable to such lot, then so long as the original or any subsequent unpaid assessment remains unpaid, such claim shall automatically accumulate the subsequent unpaid assessments without the necessity of further filings under this section.
        </li>
        <li id="t45c08s45-810ol1b">
         The claim shall be verified by the oath of an individual having knowledge of the facts and shall be recorded by the county recorder. The record shall be indexed as other liens are required by law to be indexed.

       </ol>
      </li>

       The lien may be continued in force for a period of time not to exceed one (1) year from the date the claim is filed and recorded under subsection (2) of this section; provided however, that such period may be extended by the homeowner’s association for not to exceed one (1) additional year by recording a written extension thereof. For the purpose of determining the date the claim is filed in those cases when subsequent unpaid assessments have accumulated under the claim as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the claim regarding each unpaid assessment shall be deemed to have been filed at the time such unpaid assessment became due. The lien may be enforced by the board of directors acting on behalf of the association.

       This section does not prohibit a homeowner’s association from pursuing an action to recover sums for which subsection (1) of this section creates a lien or from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of the lien.

       An action to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments may be maintained without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the claim for unpaid assessments. However, recovery on the action operates to satisfy the lien, or the portion thereof, for which recovery is made.

        The conclusion reached by the trial court that securities credit corporation was a general creditor was correct, acknowledgments to the chattel mortgages being void and the instruments not meeting the requirements by being properly acknowledged and lawfully filed under the chattel mortgage section. A judgment having been entered for the disposition for the property prevents the defendant from now availing himself of the statute by correcting the errors in mortgages. Jordan v.

        Where the question was whether a bill of sale of property and a conditional sale contract with respect to the same property were a chattel mortgage or an absolute conveyance from one to another, the evidence was sufficient to require the submission of the issues to a jury.

        The question of whether a bill of sale of property and a conditional sale contract with respect thereto are to be construed as an absolute conveyance from one party to the other, and a contract to reconvey from the latter to the former, or whether they constitute a mortgage, is, in an action at law where the evidence is conflicting, for the jury.

       <p>
        It is well settled that the law existing when a mortgage is made enters into and becomes a part of the contract and a note and mortgage will be construed as one contract. Steward v. Nelson, 54 Idaho 437, 32 P.2d 843 (1934). Lien of Mortgage Survives How Long.
       </p>
       <p>
        The life of a mortgage does not cease to exist so long as the notes secured by it are actionable, for the reason that the mortgage is an incident to the debt. So long as the note secured by a mortgage is kept alive, then it is actionable, and a note is kept alive, consequently either by the obligee signing an agreement promising payment, or making payment on principal or interest, and the mortgage lien will continue and remain unimpaired for five years thereafter. Steward v. Nelson, 54 Idaho 437, 32 P.2d 843 (1934).

        A “mortgage” is a contract by which specific property is hypothecated for performance of an act without necessity of change of possession. Eastern Idaho Loan & Trust Co. v. Blomberg, 62 Idaho 497, 113 P.2d 406 (1941).

        Under provision in a mortgage that, if the mortgagor failed to pay taxes and water assessments, mortgagee could pay the same and such payments would become a part of the mortgage debt, such provision is upheld, and mortgagee is entitled to have payments made by him for taxes and water assessments become a part of the mortgage debt and secured accordingly.

       </p>
       <p>
        Rule is well recognized and established that deed absolute in form may be shown to have been intended as mortgage. Wright v. Rosebaugh, 46 Idaho 526, 269 P. 98 (1928); Investors Mtg. Secur. Co. v. Hamilton, 51 Idaho 113, 4 P.2d 347 (1931).

        To justify trial court in determining that deed which purports to convey land absolutely in fee simple is mortgage, evidence must be clear, satisfactory and convincing.

       <p>
        A warranty deed along with an agreement to reconvey the property in the future was an outright conveyance rather than a mortgage, where the transaction did not secure any debt, defendants’ predecessors could reacquire the property by paying certain sums to plaintiffs’ predecessors, but they were not obligated to make those payments, and amount paid by plaintiffs’ predecessors was the fair market value of the real property at the time of the transaction.

       <p>
        Where deed, absolute on its face, is taken to real property but is, in effect, an equitable mortgage, and plaintiff prays to have the same so declared, and no application is made to foreclose said mortgage, proper form of decree is that plaintiff be allowed to redeem upon the payment of the sum found due within a reasonable time to be fixed by the decree, and that upon such payment the mortgage shall be adjudged to be satisfied, and that in default of such payment the title shall be quieted in defendant.

       <p>
        The test to determine whether an instrument is a mortgage or absolute conveyance is whether, at the time of the execution thereof, there was a debt owing from the giver of such instrument to the grantee or vendee therein, and whether such debt existed after the execution of the instrument. Dickens v. Heston, 53 Idaho 91, 21 P.2d 905 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before an instrument, purporting to be an absolute conveyance on its face, can be construed as a mortgage or security, it is indispensable that there be an existing indebtedness. Fond v. McCreery, 55 Idaho 144, 39 P.2d 766 (1934).

        The facts were sufficient to warrant a holding that a deed and contract given at the same time should be construed together as one transaction, and not as a separate and distinct transaction, and that they constituted a mortgage. Dickens v. Heston, 53 Idaho 91, 21 P.2d 905 (1933); Jaussaud v. Samuels, 58 Idaho 191, 71 P.2d 426 (1937). Pledge of Lease.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a lease has been recorded as a chattel mortgage, a delivery of a copy thereof to a party having a second mortgage on a portion of the leased property constitutes a sufficient delivery of the lease as to amount to a valid pledge thereof.

       <p>
        The question is whether a bill of sale of property and a conditional sale contract with respect to the same property are a chattel mortgage or an absolute conveyance from one to another, with a contract to reconvey, and the evidence was sufficient to require the submission of the issues to a jury.

        Where instrument in writing in the form of deed of conveyance is executed and delivered as security for a debt, such instrument becomes a mortgage and not a deed, notwithstanding form of instrument. Bergen v. Johnson, 21 Idaho 619, 123 P. 484 (1912).
    Warranty deeds, executed and delivered by insolvent debtor to corporation, to which he was largely indebted at the time, to secure debt, held, in effect, mortgages. Capital Lumber Co. v. Saunders, 26 Idaho 408, 143 P. 1178 (1914).

        Mortgage may be created by transfer of certain material to L. under a written contract providing that L. shall sign a note as security for B., who shall thereupon buy such material in the name of and for the sole use and benefit of L., and that, upon payment of the note, L. shall deliver and sell material to a third party, such transfer being for security only.

        Warranty deeds executed and delivered by insolvent debtor to corporation to which he was largely indebted at the time, to secure the debt were held, in effect, mortgages. Capital Lumber Co. v. Saunders, 26 Idaho 408, 143 P. 1178 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether or not deed absolute in form is mortgage is mixed question of law and fact to be determined from all evidence, written or parol; and, in determining it, all facts and circumstances attending transaction should be considered. Wright v. Rosebaugh, 46 Idaho 526, 269 P. 98 (1928).
    Rule applies whether or not deed is warranty deed and whether deed is accompanied by condition or matter of defeasance expressed in deed, contained in separate instrument or existing merely in parol. Wright v. Rosebaugh, 46 Idaho 526, 269 P. 98 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether instrument is conveyance or mortgage, determining question is whether or not debt is paid on execution and delivery of deed. Investors Mtg. Secur. Co. v. Hamilton, 51 Idaho 113, 4 P.2d 347 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, parol evidence was admissible to show that purported deeds were in fact mortgages and so intended by the parties. Gem-Valley Ranches, Inc. v. Small, 90 Idaho 354, 411 P.2d 943 (1966).

        Evidence.

       <p>
        Parol evidence is admissible to show that deed absolute on its face is, in fact, a mortgage. Thompson v. Burns, 15 Idaho 572, 99 P. 111 (1908); Investors Mtg. Secur. Co. v. Hamilton, 51 Idaho 113, 4 P.2d 347 (1931); Smith v. Swendsen, 57 Idaho 715, 69 P.2d 131 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the instant case, the facts were held sufficient to warrant a holding that a deed and contract given at the same time should be construed together as one transaction, and not as a separate and distinct transaction, and that they constituted a mortgage. Dickens v. Heston, 53 Idaho 91, 21 P.2d 905 (1933); Jaussaud v. Samuels, 58 Idaho 191, 71 P.2d 426 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exclusion of evidence of the intention of the parties that a deed was intended as a mortgage was not prejudicial in view of evidence that was admitted of indebtedness of the grantors to the grantee before and after the conveyance, of lack of monetary payment by the grantee to the grantors, and the grantee’s cancellation of a note and mortgage at the time of the conveyance without extinguishment of the debt. Credit Bureau v. Sleight, 92 Idaho 210, 440 P.2d 143 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        An option, when exercised, is a contract for the conveyance of property; however, a conveyance which appears absolute in form may be shown by extrinsic evidence actually to be security for a debt. The proof must be by clear and convincing evidence. McGill v. Lester, 108 Idaho 561, 700 P.2d 964 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the grantee denied that she promised to convey the property back to the original owner, but conceded being informed of his previous ownership and that the third party, who conveyed the deed to her, had agreed to reconvey it to the original owner, the grantee could not be said to have taken the deed “without notice,” and therefore did not come within the exception of this section. Parol evidence on the question of defeasance was admissible. Kreiensieck v. Cook, 108 Idaho 657, 701 P.2d 277 (Ct. App. 1985).

       <p>
        Upon a proper showing, the form of an instrument yields to its underlying purpose: a deed may be shown actually to be a mortgage; the apparent conveyance of an ownership interest under an installment sale contract may be shown actually to be the creation of a security interest; and an option may be shown to merely secure a debt. McGill v. Lester, 108 Idaho 561, 700 P.2d 964 (Ct. App. 1985).

       <p>
        The criteria for evaluating whether the purpose of an instrument is the creation of a security interest are: (a) the existence of a debt to be secured; (b) survival of the debt after execution of the instrument in question; (c) any previous negotiations of parties; (d) the inadequacy of consideration for an outright conveyance; (e) the financial condition of the purported grantor; and (f) the intention of the parties. McGill v. Lester, 108 Idaho 561, 700 P.2d 964 (Ct. App. 1985). Foreclosure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a transaction amounts to a mortgage, it must be foreclosed to satisfy the debt secured thereby. Jaussaud v. Samuels, 58 Idaho 191, 71 P.2d 426 (1937).

        Deed absolute on its face cannot be held to be a mortgage unless there is a debt to be secured thereby, and evidence must be clear that it was not a sale. Bergen v. Johnson, 21 Idaho 619, 123 P. 484 (1912); Shaner v. Rathdrum State Bank, 29 Idaho 576, 161 P. 90 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test to determine whether an instrument is a mortgage or absolute conveyance is whether, at the time of the execution thereof, there was a debt owing from the giver of such instrument to the grantee or vendee therein, and whether such debt existed after the execution of the instrument. Dickens v. Heston, 53 Idaho 91, 21 P.2d 905 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before an instrument, purporting to be an absolute conveyance on its face, can be construed as a mortgage or security, it is indispensable that there be an existing indebtedness. Fond v. McCreery, 55 Idaho 144, 39 P.2d 766 (1934).

      When any mortgage, affecting the title to real property, has been satisfied, the holder thereof or his assignee must immediately, on the demand of the mortgagor, purchaser, or the successor in interest of either, execute, acknowledge, and deliver to him a certificate of the discharge thereof so as to entitle it to be recorded, or he must enter satisfaction or cause satisfaction of such mortgage or affecting the title to real property, to be entered of record; and any holder, or assignee of such holder, who refuses to execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the mortgagor, purchaser, or the successor in interest of either, the certificate of discharge, or to enter satisfaction, or cause satisfaction of the mortgage to be entered, as provided in this chapter, is liable to the mortgagor, purchaser, or his grantee or heirs, for all damages which he or they may sustain by reason of such refusal, and shall also forfeit to him or them the sum of $100.

        In an action to quiet title and for the penalty for failure to satisfy a mortgage, wherein defendant filed a cross-complaint on the mortgage, the evidence was sufficient to show that the plaintiffs were indebted to the defendant for a balance of instalments due, taxes, and outlay for bringing the abstract up-to-date, and that there existed a bona fide controversy concerning the amount due, and the court was justified in refusal to impose penalty for failure to satisfy a mortgage. Platts v. Pacific First Federal Savings & Loan Ass’n, 62 Idaho 340, 111 P.2d 1093 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for penalties and damages for a failure to satisfy mortgages, copies of the mortgagee’s inter-office requests for releases of the mortgages involved and return memorandum containing such releases allegedly mailed to the mortgagor, were admissible only for the purpose of impeaching the testimony of the mortgagor that he had received no releases. Henderson v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 65 Idaho 570, 149 P.2d 133 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by a farm implements dealer for damages for a mortgagee’s failure to satisfy chattel mortgages, the dealer’s testimony of the value of contracts of employment, which he testified he was prevented from obtaining because the chattel mortgages in question had not been released, was improperly excluded. Henderson v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 65 Idaho 570, 149 P.2d 133 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment for penalties and damages for failure to satisfy mortgages was not reversible on the theory that, notwithstanding conditional sales contracts were removed from the jury’s consideration, their baneful effect remained. Henderson v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 65 Idaho 570, 149 P.2d 133 (1943).

        Complaint for damages for failure to release chattel mortgages based on loss of profits for contemplated purchase of bred ewes was not proved, where evidence showed that plaintiff was not in the sheep business at the time of the contemplated transaction and had not been for some years past.

       <p>
        Plaintiff under count for statutory penalty for failure to release mortgage established a prima facie case of lack of good faith where there was evidence that defendant stated his refusal in following language: “that’s my business, I will release them when I get d— good and ready to, to h— with you” and that when subsequently approached over the phone for release he was just mum and hung up the phone. Head v. Crone, 76 Idaho 196, 279 P.2d 1064 (1955). — Questions of Fact.
       </p>

        In an action for penalties and damages for failure to satisfy mortgages, whether the mortgagee’s defense that valid releases had been received by the mortgagor was established was for the jury. Henderson v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 65 Idaho 570, 149 P.2d 133 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for penalties and damages for failure to satisfy a mortgage, whether the mortgagor’s request of the mortgagee to satisfy the mortgage was sufficient was a question for the jury. Henderson v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 65 Idaho 570, 149 P.2d 133 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mortgagee is not liable for statutory penalty for failure to release mortgage if there is a bona fide controversy over the amount due, and refusal to release is in good faith. Head v. Crone, 76 Idaho 196, 279 P.2d 1064 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgagee was not excused from executing a joint release of six mortgages on the ground that there was a balance due on the last mortgage, where the evidence showed that mortgagee owed the mortgagor on a running account. Head v. Crone, 76 Idaho 196, 279 P.2d 1064 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusal of mortgagee to release six mortgages could not be excused on the ground that there was no consideration for one of the mortgages, since a mortgage is not fraudulent merely because there is lack of consideration, and furthermore question of fraud can only be raised by the creditors in a proper proceeding.

       An instrument containing a form or forms of covenants, conditions, obligations, powers, and other clauses of a mortgage or deed of trust may be recorded in the office of the county recorder of any county, and the recorder of such county, upon the request of any person, on tender of the lawful fees therefor, shall record the same. Every such instrument shall be entitled on the face thereof as a “Master form recorded by . . . (name of person causing the instrument to be recorded).” Such instrument need not be acknowledged or proved or certified to be entitled to record.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c10s45-1004ol12">
       When any such instrument is recorded, the recorder shall index it under the name of the person causing it to be recorded in the manner provided for miscellaneous instruments relating to real property.

       Thereafter any of the provisions of such master form instrument may be incorporated by reference in any mortgage or deed of trust of real property situated within this state, if such reference in the mortgage or deed of trust states that the master form instrument was recorded in the county in which the mortgage or deed of trust is offered for record, the date when and the book and page where such master form instrument was recorded, and that a copy of such master form instrument was furnished to the person executing the mortgage or deed of trust. The recording of any mortgage or deed of trust which has so incorporated by reference therein any of the provisions of a master form instrument recorded as provided in this section shall have like effect as if such provisions of the master form so incorporated by reference had been set forth fully in the mortgage or deed of trust.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c10s45-1004ol14">
       Whenever a mortgage or deed of trust is presented for recording on which is set forth matter purporting to be a copy or reproduction of such master form instrument or part thereof, identified by its title as hereinabove provided and stating the date when it was recorded and the book and page where it was recorded, preceded by the words “do not record” or “not to be recorded,” and plainly separated from the matter to be recorded as a part of the mortgage or deed of trust in such manner that it will not appear from a photographic reproduction of any page containing any part of the mortgage or deed of trust, such matter shall not be recorded; in such case the recorder shall record only the mortgage or deed of trust apart from such matter and shall not be liable for so doing, any other provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding.

A trustee shall be entitled to refuse to reconvey a deed of trust until the trustee’s reconveyance fees and recording costs for recording the reconveyance instruments are paid in full. The trustee shall not be entitled to a foreclosure fee in the event of judicial foreclosure or work done prior to the recording of a notice of default.

       <p>
        Under Idaho law a trust deed, which conveyed property exceeding 20 acres [now 80 acres] and did not contain the “statement” required by subdivision (5) of this section, would be treated as a mortgage, the creditor losing only the right to nonjudicial foreclosure and the shorter 120-day period of cure as opposed to one year post-foreclosure period of redemption. Because the trust deed would be recognized as a mortgage by Idaho law, its recordation is constructive notice of the beneficiary’s lien, which would protect its rights as against subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers. Bear Lake W., Inc. v. Stock, 36 Bankr. 413 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1984) (See 2008 amendment).
    If a trust deed recites that the property described complies with the acreage requirement of this section, such statement is conclusive with respect to compliance with the statute. Even had the deed of trust not recited that the property conveyed the requisite acreage, that defect would not render the instrument ineffective to create a lien. While the beneficiary would likely lose the right to foreclose the deed of trust by private sale, the instrument would be treated as a mortgage subject to judicial foreclosure. Hymas v. Am. Gen. Fin., Inc. (In re Blair), 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 2115 (Bankr. D. Idaho May 18, 2000) (See 2008 amendment).

       Transfers in trust of any estate in real property as defined in section 45-1502(5), Idaho Code, may hereafter be made to secure the performance of an obligation of the grantor or any other person named in the deed to a beneficiary. Where any transfer in trust of any estate in real property is hereafter made to secure the performance of such an obligation, a power of sale is hereby conferred upon the trustee to be exercised after a breach of the obligation for which such transfer is security, and a deed of trust executed in conformity with this act may be foreclosed by advertisement and sale in the manner hereinafter provided, or, at the option of beneficiary, by foreclosure as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. If any obligation secured by a trust deed is breached, the beneficiary may not institute a judicial action against the grantor or his successor in interest to enforce an obligation owed by the grantor or his successor in interest unless:

       (3) The beneficiary may bring an action to enforce an obligation owed by grantor or his successor in interest alleging that the beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless without affecting the priority of the lien of the trust deed and without waiving his right to require the trust deed to be foreclosed by advertisement and sale and the beneficiary may, but shall not be required to, plead an alternative claim for foreclosure of the trust deed as a mortgage in the same action. If the court finds that the property is not substantially valueless, the beneficiary may seek judicial foreclosure of the trust deed, or he may dismiss the action and foreclose the trust deed by advertisement and sale in the manner provided in this chapter. If the court finds that the beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless and enters a judgment upon the obligation, when that judgment becomes final the beneficiary shall execute a written request to the trustee to reconvey to the grantor or his successor in interest the estate in real property described in the trust deed. If the beneficiary obtains judgment on an obligation secured by a trust deed pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section, the lien of the judgment shall not relate back to the date of the lien of the trust deed.

       <p>
        The thrust of the legislative intent with regard to the 1989 amendment of this section is that where the obligation secured by a deed of trust is breached, the beneficiary may not institute a judicial action unless specific conditions are met, and this language hardly lends itself to the argument that the legislature meant for this section as amended to have retroactive effect upon existing actions.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Mortgage foreclosure is a legal proceeding where a lender terminates a borrower’s interest in property to satisfy unpaid debt secured by the property. This can mean that when a homeowner gets behind on his or her mortgage payments, the lender forces a sale of the home on which the mortgage loan is based. Some individuals or businesses may say they can “save” your home from foreclosure. You should be cautious about such claims. It is important that you understand all the terms of a plan to “rescue” you from mortgage foreclosure and how it will affect you. It may result in your losing valuable equity that you may have in your home. If possible, you should consult with an attorney or financial professional to find out what other options you may have. Do not delay seeking advice, because the longer you wait, the fewer options you may have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Idaho law, you have five (5) days to rescind or undo certain contracts or agreements that relate to transferring interests in property or money in a foreclosure situation. An attorney or financial professional can tell you more about this option.”.

       If the trust deed, or any assignments of the trust deed, are in the Spanish language, the written notice set forth in this section shall be in the Spanish language on a form to be prepared and made available by the office of the attorney general.

The trustee shall sell the property in one (1) parcel or in separate parcels at auction to the highest bidder. Any person, including the beneficiary under the trust deed, may bid at the trustee’s sale. The attorney for such trustee may conduct the sale and act in such sale as the auctioneer of trustee. The trustee may postpone the sale of the property upon request of the beneficiary by publicly announcing at the time and place originally fixed for the sale the postponement to a stated subsequent date and hour. No sale may be postponed to a date more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date from which the sale is postponed. A postponed sale may itself be postponed in the same manner and within the same time limitations as provided in this subsection. For any loan made by a state or federally regulated beneficiary, which loan is secured by a deed of trust encumbering the borrower’s primary residence as determined pursuant to section 45-1506C(1), Idaho Code, the trustee, prior to conducting any trustee’s sale previously postponed pursuant to this section, shall mail notice of such trustee sale at least fourteen (14) days prior to conducting such sale by the same means and to the same persons as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The trustee or beneficiary shall, prior to conducting the trustee’s sale, record an affidavit of mailing confirming that such notice has been mailed as required by this section. The filing of such affidavit of mailing is conclusive evidence of compliance with this section as to any party relying on said affidavit of mailing.

     <p>
      (9) The purchaser at the sale shall forthwith pay the price bid and upon receipt of payment the trustee shall execute and deliver the trustee’s deed to such purchaser, provided that in the event of any refusal to pay purchase money, the officer making such sale shall have the right to resell or reject any subsequent bid as provided by law in the case of sales under execution.

     <p>
      (10) The trustee’s deed shall convey to the purchaser the interest in the property which the grantor had, or had the power to convey, at the time of the execution by him of the trust deed together with any interest the grantor or his successors in interest acquired after the execution of such trust deed.
     </p>
     <p>
      (11) The purchaser at the trustee’s sale shall be entitled to possession of the property on the tenth day following the sale, and any persons remaining in possession thereafter under any interest except one prior to the deed of trust shall be deemed to be tenants at sufferance.
     </p>
     <p>
      (12) Whenever all or a portion of any obligation secured by a deed of trust which has become due by reason of a default of any part of that obligation, including taxes, assessments, premiums for insurance or advances made by a beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the deed of trust, the grantor or his successor in interest in the trust property or any part thereof, or any beneficiary under a subordinate deed of trust or any person having a subordinate lien or encumbrance of record thereon, at any time within one hundred fifteen (115) days of the recording of the notice of default under such deed of trust, if the power of sale therein is to be exercised, or otherwise at any time prior to the entry of a decree of foreclosure, may pay to the beneficiary or their successors in interest, respectively, the entire amount then due under the terms of the deed of trust and the obligation secured thereby, including costs and expenses actually incurred in enforcing the terms of such obligation and a reasonable trustee’s fee subject to the limitations imposed by subsection (6) of section 45-1502, Idaho Code, and attorney’s fees as may be provided in the promissory note, other than such portion of the principal as would not then be due had no default occurred, and thereby cure the default theretofore existing, and thereupon, all proceedings theretofore had or instituted shall be dismissed or discontinued and the obligation and deed of trust shall be reinstated and shall be and remain in force and effect, the same as if no acceleration had occurred.

      (13) Any mailing to persons outside the United States and its territories required by this chapter may be made by ordinary first class mail if certified or registered mail service is unavailable.

        Curing Default.

       <p>
        Expenses of the trustee’s sale, including a reasonable charge by the trustee and a reasonable attorney’s fee incurred up to the time of sale, interest accrued from the date of sale to the date of judgment at the rate provided in the promissory note, and costs of the action for a deficiency and reasonable attorney fees incurred in the action were recoverable by the beneficiary in an action to obtain a deficiency judgment. Farber v. Howell, 111 Idaho 132, 721 P.2d 731 (Ct. App. 1986). Curing Default.
       </p>
       <p>
        A tender of money to cure a default under subsection (12) of this section, which would usually be indispensable, is not required when its futility is shown; however, the fact that a bank manager had stated that he would have to check to see if a payment curing the default could be accepted was not enough, standing alone, to establish that an actual tender would have been futile. Owens v. Idaho First Nat’l Bank, 103 Idaho 465, 649 P.2d 1221 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to constitute a valid tender of money, the law requires an actual, present, physical offer and a mere spoken offer to pay does not qualify as a valid tender; therefore, where an agent for property owners, whose property was to be sold after they defaulted on a note to a bank, only made an oral offer to cure the default in a phone conversation with the bank manager, the offer did not constitute a valid tender. Owens v. Idaho First Nat’l Bank, 103 Idaho 465, 649 P.2d 1221 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement between the parties did not merely provide that the sale would be postponed; it eliminated the default by altering the terms of the promissory note so that there were no longer any sums past due. Taylor v. Just, 138 Idaho 137, 59 P.3d 308 (2002).

       <p>
        Because the lender bid in excess of the amount of credit available to it under one of the deeds of trust, it did not pay the price owing before the trustee executed the trustee’s deed as required by this section. However, it was unnecessary to set aside the sale, as the sale became final when the trustee accepted the lender’s bid. Spencer v. Jameson, 147 Idaho 497, 211 P.3d 106 (2009).

       <p>
        If plaintiff had produced money and defendant had refused to accept the amount, an injunction to stay foreclosure would have been in order; however, where there was no evidence that there was an actual production or delivery of money coupled with plaintiff’s offer to pay, an injunction against foreclosure was properly denied. Statement of defendant that the entire balance of the deed of trust was due was not sufficient to constitute a refusal, thus excusing plaintiff from making a valid tender in order to avoid foreclosure of deed of trust.

    If no bankruptcy is ever filed and no stay intervenes, postponement of a foreclosure sale proceeds according to subsection (8) of this section; but if a stay is in effect on the date of a scheduled sale, postponement proceeds according to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t45c01s45-1506A" target="_self">§ 45-1506A</a></cite>.

        Lender complied with this section in effecting a foreclosure sale of Chapter 11 debtors’ property where the notice of sale was published in the Idaho Statesman; the claim by the debtors that the lender did not provide the notice required by the deed of trust did not invalidate the sale, because the debtors failed to establish that the alleged breach of the deed of trust would vitiate the statutory foreclosure process.

        This section requires that notice of the foreclosure sale be mailed to the personal representative of the estate of the deceased person who was entitled to notice. At the time the notice was mailed in this case, the owner was not the personal representative of the estate; the fact that she was appointed as personal representative eighteen months later did not retroactively validate the failure to comply with the section.

        Where a mortgagor defaulted upon her mortgage loan repayment obligation, a trustee’s sale was scheduled, the sale was postponed when the mortgagor agreed to make a partial payment in exchange for the postponement. The trustee verbally announced the time and place for the rescheduled sale, and the property was sold at the rescheduled sale. The buyer instituted an ejectment action to remove the mortgagor from the property, and the mortgagor claimed that she was deprived of due process because she did not receive notice of the postponed sale date. The notice was sufficient because the trustee’s announcement at the original sale date complied with subsection (8) of this section. While the mortgagor might have prevailed if she had persisted in her argument that the sale had been cancelled rather than postponed, her attorney failed to pursue this argument on appeal, and the court was not in a position to act upon a ground not presented on appeal.

    Pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t45c15s45-1505" target="_self">§ 45-1505</a></cite>, a trustee may initiate nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings on a deed of trust without first proving ownership of the underlying note or demonstrating that the deed of trust beneficiary has requested or authorized the trustee to initiate those proceedings.

        Where acceptable to the mortgagees, there is no impediment to ordering a simultaneous foreclosure; the foreclosure sale would result in each party being reimbursed by priority to the extent of the proceeds, neither would receive a redemption right, and each would receive a deficiency to the extent his or her debt was not satisfied, with appropriate credit being given for the reasonable value of the security.

       (2)(a) The notice required under subsection (1) of this section must be accompanied by a form to request a loan modification. The form must include the address to which and state the date by which the grantor must return the form. The form may state that the grantor must disclose current information about the grantor’s income and expenses, the grantor’s address, phone number and electronic mail address and other facts that may affect the grantor’s eligibility for a loan modification.

       (3) If a grantor returns the form identified in subsection (2) of this section to the beneficiary by the date specified on the form, the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent shall review the information the grantor provided in the form and shall evaluate the grantor’s request. The beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent, as soon as reasonably practicable but not later than forty-five (45) days after receiving the form, shall notify the grantor in writing whether the beneficiary approves or denies the request or requires additional information. A trustee’s sale for the property subject to the loan may not occur until after the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent timely responds to the grantor. During the forty-five (45) day period, the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent may request the grantor to provide additional information required to determine whether the loan can be modified.
      </p>

       (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if the grantor timely requests a meeting with the beneficiary, the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent shall either meet with the grantor in person or speak to the grantor by telephone before the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent responds to the grantor’s request to modify the loan. If the grantor requests the meeting, the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent shall schedule the meeting by contacting the grantor at the grantor’s last known address or telephone number or at the grantor’s electronic mail address, if the grantor indicates on the loan modification form that the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent can contact the grantor at the electronic mail address.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) A beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent complies with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection even if the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent does not speak to or meet with the grantor if, within seven (7) business days after the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent attempts to contact the grantor, the grantor does not schedule a meeting, or fails to attend a scheduled meeting or telephone call.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) The beneficiary or the beneficiary’s agent that meets with the grantor shall have or be able to obtain authority to modify the loan.

        Holders of a promissory note secured by a deed of trust, who sued for a money judgment on the note, were not subject to the statutory limitations applicable to a deficiency action following foreclosure; the time limit provided for in this section applies to deficiency actions resulting from foreclosure sales; it does not apply to a creditor’s action on the debt which is independent of any foreclosure proceedings; under these circumstances, a creditor has five years in which to bring an action upon his promissory note, as provided for in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-216" target="_blank">§ 5-216</a></cite>.

        The protection in this section extends only to the borrower-grantor who gives the security interest in deed of trust. Willis v. Realty Country, Inc., 121 Idaho 312, 824 P.2d 887 (Ct. App. 1991).

        Because the time period within which the mortgage company could have sought a deficiency judgment had long passed, the owners failed to show an accounting could be relevant to any issues in the case. PHH Mortg. Servs. Corp. v. Perreira, 146 Idaho 631, 200 P.3d 1180 (2009).

        When a bank foreclosed on a mortgage on a cottage on land leased from the Idaho department of lands, the bank’s deficiency claim was barred because (1) the cottage was real property, (2) the lease was not substantially valueless, (3) the bank had to first foreclose on the mortgage, (4) the claim was not asserted within three months of foreclosing, and (5) the claim did not relate back to original or first amended complaints, under which the claim would have been timely.

        The district court was correct in not accepting construction cost as the equivalent of fair market value in a suit for a deficiency judgment following a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of property subject to a deed of trust. Logan v. Grand Junction Assocs., 111 Idaho 670, 726 P.2d 782 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court committed reversible error in holding that the plaintiffs failed in their burden to prove a deficiency because the experts were unable to agree on a particular figure; the district court must reconsider, compare and weigh the evidence as a fact finder and determine the fair market value of the property in question.

        In determining the fair market value of the property, the district judge did not err by admitting evidence of a third party’s offer to purchase the property several months before the trustee’s sale, where the evidence was reliable, nonspeculative and free from hearsay, confrontation or other problems.

        Where acceptable to the mortgagees, there is no impediment to ordering a simultaneous foreclosure; the foreclosure sale would result in each party being reimbursed by priority to the extent of the proceeds, neither would receive a redemption right, and each would receive a deficiency to the extent his or her debt was not satisfied, with appropriate credit being given for the reasonable value of the security.

        Where there was evidence of an offer of $325,000, one appraiser valued the property at $265,000, and another appraiser valued the property at $340,000, there was sufficient evidence to support the judge’s finding that the property was worth at least the amount of the indebtedness at the time of the trustee’s sale, approximately $317,000.

       <p>
        Where guarantor of loan expressly waived any right to require creditor to proceed against the principal obligor, or to pursue any other available remedy, such language was broad enough to include waiver of a defense that creditor failed to seek recovery for the deficiency from debtor within the three-month time period prescribed by this section.

      The legislature finds that some persons and businesses are engaging in patterns of conduct that defraud innocent homeowners of their title, equity interest, or other value in residential dwellings under the guise of stopping or postponing a foreclosure sale. The legislature also finds this activity to be contrary to the public policy of this state and therefore establishes notice requirements governing contracts or agreements entered into during the foreclosure period. The legislature further finds that the provisions of this chapter shall be construed in such a manner that it does not inhibit transactions with legitimate lenders and investors.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Mortgage foreclosure is a legal proceeding where a lender terminates a borrower’s interest in property to satisfy unpaid debt secured by the property. This can mean that when a homeowner gets behind on his or her mortgage payments, the lender forces a sale of the home on which the mortgage loan is based. Some individuals or businesses may say they can “save” your home from foreclosure. You should be cautious about such claims. It is important that you understand all the terms of a plan to “rescue” you from mortgage foreclosure and how it will affect you. It may result in your losing valuable equity that you may have in your home. If possible, you should consult with an attorney or financial professional to find out what other options you may have. Do not delay seeking advice, because the longer you wait, the fewer options you may have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may find helpful information online. One excellent source is the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website which can be found at “http://www.hud.gov/foreclosure/index.cfm”. HUD also maintains on its website a list of approved housing counselors who can provide free information to assist homeowners with financial problems. Another good source of information is found at the Office of the Attorney General’s website at “http://www2.state.id.us/ag′’.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Idaho law, you have five (5) days to rescind or undo certain contracts or agreements that relate to transferring interests in property or money in a foreclosure situation. An attorney or financial professional can tell you more about this option.”.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) If during the foreclosure period described in section 45-1506, Idaho Code, any contract or agreement that involves the transfer of any interest in residential real property, as defined in section 45-525(5)(b), Idaho Code, was solicited, negotiated, or represented to the consumer in the Spanish language, the written notice to be provided to the consumer and set forth in this section shall be in the Spanish language on a form to be prepared and made available by the office of the attorney general.

     <p>
      An agricultural commodity producer or an agricultural commodity dealer who sells, or delivers under contract or bailment, an agricultural product has a lien on the agricultural product or the proceeds of the sale of the agricultural product as provided in section 45-1804, Idaho Code. The lien created in this chapter may attach regardless of whether the purchaser uses the agricultural product purchased to increase the value of his livestock or whether he uses the agricultural product purchased to maintain the value, health or status of his livestock without actually increasing the value of his agricultural product.

        Plain language of the first sentence does not provide any basis for a commodity producer or dealer to maintain a lien right in livestock, as lien rights are extended only to agricultural products and the proceeds of the sale of agricultural products.
