        Evidence sufficiently supported trial court’s findings that, at the time plaintiff’s automobile struck defendant’s calf on the highway, the fence, owned and maintained by defendant to inclose his cattle, was in disrepair and did not conform to the standards prescribed for lawful fences. Soran v. Schoessler, 87 Idaho 425, 394 P.2d 160 (1964), overruled on other grounds, Moreland v. Adams, 143 Idaho 687, 152 P.3d 558 (2007).

        A finding that fence posts of defendant appellant, who was sued for damages sustained by plaintiff’s automobile when it struck defendant’s calf along the highway, “were not set substantially in the ground and were rotted at the ground causing many posts to lean perceptibly,” was sustained by the evidence. Soran v. Schoessler, 87 Idaho 425, 394 P.2d 160 (1964), overruled on other grounds, Moreland v. Adams, 143 Idaho 687, 152 P.3d 558 (2007).

        In suit by motorist to recover for damage occasioned by a nighttime collision with a cow roaming a heavily traveled highway, the jury should have been instructed on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, that doctrine having application in view of lack of sufficient explanation of failure to keep cow inclosed and lack of showing fence through which cow broke conformed to the legal requirements of a fence.

        Evidence sustained trial court’s conclusion that defendant, whose calf was struck by plaintiff’s automobile, failed to act as a reasonable and prudent person with respect to his pasture fence and in allowing his livestock on the public highway, that plaintiff acted prudently, and that defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s damage. Soran v. Schoessler, 87 Idaho 425, 394 P.2d 160 (1964), overruled on other grounds, Moreland v. Adams, 143 Idaho 687, 152 P.3d 558 (2007).

        The legal fence laws of this state are “fencing out” statutes and recognize the rancher’s right to allow cattle to roam. Maguire v. Yanke, 99 Idaho 829, 590 P.2d 85 (1978).

        In suit by plaintiff against railroad to recover damages for loss of horse and colt on defendant’s right of way at a spot where the only barrier was a 15 foot fill, evidence that the defendant had erected a fence shortly after the accident where the accident had occurred was material for the purpose of showing antecedent negligence on defendant’s part, and defendant’s recognition of a defect it was bound to remedy.

        § 35-102. Lawful fences described.
       </h3>
       <p>
        Lawful fences are described as follows:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t35c01s35-102ol11">
         If made of stone, four feet (4′) high, two feet (2′) base, and one foot (1′) thick on top.
        </li>
        <li id="t35c01s35-102ol12">
         If it be a worm fence, the rails must be well laid and at least four feet (4′) high.
        </li>
        <li id="t35c01s35-102ol13">
         If made of posts, with boards, rails or poles, the posts must be well set in the ground and not more than eight feet (8′) apart, with not less than three (3) six-inch (6″) boards, or rails, or poles not less than two and one-half inches (2 ½″) in diameter at the small end; if four (4) poles are used, they must not be less than two inches (2″) in diameter at the small end. The top board, rail or pole must not be less than four feet (4′) from the ground, the spaces well divided, and the boards, rails or poles securely fastened to the posts; if poles not less than three inches (3″) in diameter at the small end are used, the posts may be set twelve feet (12′) apart.
        </li>
        <li id="t35c01s35-102ol14">
         If wire be used in the construction of fences, the posts must not be more than twenty-four feet (24′) apart, set substantially in the ground, and three (3) substantial stays must be placed at equal distances between the posts, and all wires must be securely fastened to each post and stay with not less than three (3) barbed wires, or four (4) coiled spring wires of not less than number nine (9) gauge. The bottom wire shall be not more than twenty-one inches (21″) from the ground, and the other wires a proper distance apart. The wires must be well stretched and the fence not less than forty-seven inches (47″) high. If all woven wire fencing is used, the top and bottom wire must be not less than number nine (9) gauge, or two (2) number thirteen (13) gauge wires twisted together, with intermediate bars not less than twelve inches (12″) apart and of not less than number fourteen (14) gauge wire, and the stay wires not more than twelve inches (12″) apart, and the top wire not less than forty-seven inches (47″) from the ground. If woven wire less in height is used, it must be brought to the height of forty-seven inches (47″) by additional barbed wires, or coiled spring wire of not less than number nine (9) gauge, and not more than twelve inches (12″) between the wires: provided, that if barbed wire only is used, and the posts are not more than sixteen feet (16′) apart, no stays need be used. Provided further that the minimum forty-seven inch (47″) fence height specified above may be reduced to forty-two inches (42″) for right-of-way fences on the state highway system when mutually agreed by the Idaho director of department of transportation and the director of the Idaho fish and game department as necessary to accommodate big game animals at major migration crossings.
        </li>
        <li id="t35c01s35-102ol15">
         If made in whole or in part of brush, ditch, pickets, hedge, or any other materials, the fence, to be lawful, must be equal in strength and capacity to turn stock, to the fence above described.
        </li>
        <li id="t35c01s35-102ol16">
         All fences in good repair, of suitable material and of every description, and all creeks, brooks, rivers, sloughs, ponds, bluffs, hills or mountains, that present a suitable obstruction to stock are deemed lawful fences.

      If adjoining proprietors cannot agree as to the proportion or the particular part of a division fence to be made, maintained or kept in repair by each respectively, either party may apply, on five (5) days’ notice, to a magistrate judge, for the appointment of three (3) viewers, who may examine witnesses on oath, and view the premises and must determine:

If any part of such determination consists in fixing the value of a fence for which one (1) party is to pay the other a proportion also fixed, such proportion must be paid within thirty (30) days after notice of such determination, and if not so paid, may be recovered by action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
