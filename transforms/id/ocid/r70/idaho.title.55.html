        The sale of land with timber on it was not the same as a sale of timber such that the income distribution mechanism of the trust was triggered, where the will distinguished between sales of realty and sales of timber, and the testator was knowledgeable in the business of timber land transactions.

        Mobile home was affixed to the land at the time of a non-judicial foreclosure sale and, therefore, was converted to real property pursuant to this section, as the owner had installed a well set-up, with a pump, pressure tanks, and lines; a septic system with inspections and hookup to the home; a driveway; power lines; and a foundation, decks, and mobile set-up.

        Permit to appropriate water is not real property. It is not an appropriation of public waters of state but merely the consent given by state to construct and acquire real property. Speer v.

        Water right is real estate and must be conveyed as real estate, and where one has a valid water permit issued to him by state engineer, he cannot convey water right secured thereby by simply handing permit to a would-be purchaser. Gard v. Thompson, 21 Idaho 485, 123 P. 497 (1912).

       </p>
       <p>
        While shares of water stock may be personalty, the water right which such shares control is real property. Bothwell v. Keefer, 53 Idaho 658, 27 P.2d 65 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        A water right is real property and may be sold as such, with the purchaser acquiring no greater right than his vendor. Beecher v. Cassia Creek Irrigation Co., 66 Idaho 1, 154 P.2d 507 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        A water right, being real property, may be acquired through prescriptive title by adverse possession and use for more than the statutory period. Pflueger v. Hopple, 66 Idaho 152, 156 P.2d 316 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff, who had prior decreed rights to water was entitled to recover damages from the defendants for loss or damage to plaintiff’s crops proximately caused by acts of defendants, which deprived plaintiff of the water decreed to his land and to the use of which he was entitled. Follett v. Taylor Bros., 77 Idaho 416, 294 P.2d 1088 (1956).
    Appellants’ decreed water right constitutes real property and such right is appurtenant to appellants’ land to which the water represented thereby has been beneficially applied. Anderson v. Cummings, 81 Idaho 327, 340 P.2d 1111 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inasmuch as water rights are real property which may be protected by injunction, mandamus or prohibition when threatened, lessor’s complaint, which alleged that as a result of lessees’ failure to use water rights they were in danger of being lost, stated a claim for equitable relief and should not have been dismissed. Olson v. Bedke, 97 Idaho 825, 555 P.2d 156 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the senior appropriators had acquired water rights, they had property rights under this section that could not be taken from them for public or private use, except by due process of law. When there was insufficient water to satisfy both the senior appropriators’ and the junior appropriators’ water rights, giving the junior appropriators a preference to the use of the water would constitute a taking for which compensation was required under Idaho Const., Art. XV, § 3. Clear Springs Foods, Inc. v. Spackman, 150 Idaho 790, 252 P.3d 71 (2011).

        Cotenant cannot take advantage of any defect in the common title by purchasing an outstanding title or encumbrance and assert it against his companions in interest. Legal title acquired by him is held in trust for the others if they choose within a reasonable time to claim the benefit of the purchase by contributing or offering to contribute their proportion of the purchase money.

        Under this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t55c05s55-508" target="_self">§ 55-508 </a></cite>the common-law rule of joint tenancy has been abrogated, and every interest in real estate granted or devised to two or more persons, other than executors or trustees, constitutes a tenancy in common, unless expressly declared to the contrary.

        This section, abrogating the common-law rule of joint tenancy, does not abolish such tenancy. It merely declares that such an interest is in common “unless declared in its creation to be a joint interest.” Gray v. Gray, 78 Idaho 439, 304 P.2d 650 (1956).

        A joint tenancy may be terminated prior to the death of one of the joint tenants by any act of the joint tenants which destroys one or more of the essential common-law unities of interest, title, time and possession. Ogilvie v. Idaho Bank & Trust Co., 99 Idaho 361, 582 P.2d 215 (1978). — Bank Account.

       <p>
        Where the tenancy was created by a written agreement in which the parties declared the tenancy to be joint, a valid gift of a joint interest in the account with right of survivorship was made and effectively delivered to the plaintiff, one of the parties, at the time the account was created, and, therefore, the balance in the account at the time of the death of one of the parties was and is the property of the plaintiff. Gray v. Gray, 78 Idaho 439, 304 P.2d 650 (1956).

       <p>
        All the elements of a valid gift inter vivos may or may not be present in the creation of a joint tenancy in a bank account. The gift may or may not be involved. The essentials of a valid joint tenancy account are those set out in S.L. 1943, ch. 30, § 1 and this section. These essentials being present, the right of the survivor does not depend on the fact of a completed gift. Gray v. Gray, 78 Idaho 439, 304 P.2d 650 (1956).

       The absolute power of alienation of property cannot be suspended by any limitation or condition whatever, for a longer permissible period than during the continuance of the lives of the persons in being at the creation of the limitation or condition, and twenty-five (25) years thereafter. No trust heretofore or hereafter created, either testamentary or inter vivos, shall be declared void, but shall be so construed as to eliminate parts violating the above provisions, and in such a way that the testators or trustors wishes are carried out to the greatest extent permitted by this section; and there shall be no presumption that a person is capable of having children at any stage of adult life.
      </li>
      <li id="t55c01s55-111Aol12">
       If a future interest or trust is created by exercise of a power of appointment, the permissible period is computed from the time the power is exercised if the power is a general power including a testamentary general power or from the time the power is created if the power is not a general power.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, there is no suspension of the power of alienation of property by a trust or by equitable interests under a trust if the trustee has power to sell, either express or implied, or if there is an unlimited power to terminate in one (1) or more persons in being.

       <p>
        The language of the possession list making gifts to various friends and charitable organizations did not offend the rule against suspension of the power of alienation pursuant to this section because this rule does not apply to charitable trusts. Salfeety v. Seideman, 127 Idaho 817, 907 P.2d 794 (1995).
    This section was not violated since the real property in trust was to be immediately sold upon settlor’s death and the proceeds distributed to designated charities; thus, there was no suspension of the power of alienation of the real property. Salfeety v. Seideman, 127 Idaho 817, 907 P.2d 794 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the only gift which could potentially violate this section was settlor’s gift of the income from the oil and gas leases, because she specifically stated in the possession list and the script that the leases should not be sold since they were a gift to charity, and because this section does not apply to charitable trusts, that gift was valid.

        The common law rule against perpetuities is generally stated to be that no interest in real estate is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest plus the period of gestation. Locklear v. Tucker, 69 Idaho 84, 203 P.2d 380 (1949).

        A testamentary trust under which the testator bequeathed his interest in a corporation to his wife, in trust, with authority to terminate trust at any time the business proved unprofitable, but otherwise to operate the same as going concern for 10 years after testator’s decease and thereafter the wife to close trust or continue it in her discretion, and with a direction that the net proceeds should be sole property of testator’s wife except that profits in excess of $20,000 in any one year should be subject to division, with the wife receiving one-half and other half being distributed among employees, did not violate statutory rule against perpetuities. In re Zeb’s Estate, 67 Idaho 567, 189 P.2d 95 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though parties had agreed that the only question involved was whether or not a trust provision violated the terms of this section, a holding that, regardless of the trust provision, petitioners were barred from any relief by other provisions of will was not prejudicial in view of fact that court determined the trust provision was valid.

      No future interest, valid in its creation, is defeated by the determination of the precedent interest before the happening of the contingency on which the future interest is limited to take effect; but should such contingency afterward happen, the future interest takes effect in the same manner and to the same extent as if the precedent interest had continued to the same period.

        A lessor’s contractual right to forfeiture must be clearly stipulated in order to be enforceable; however, even absent a contractual forfeiture remedy, such statutory remedy is still available in an unlawful detainer action. Consequently, absent a clear contractual right to declare forfeiture, a landlord may not, without the express consent of a tenant, repossess his property without resorting to remedies provided in the unlawful detainer statutes.

       <p>
        The remedy of forfeiture permitted under the unlawful detainer statutes is merely cumulative to any contractual right of reentry provided for in the lease agreement. Riverside Dev. Co. v. Ritchie, 103 Idaho 515, 650 P.2d 657 (1982). Notice.
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice not complying with the requirements of this section was ineffective as a cancellation of the lease. Adair v. Freeman, 92 Idaho 773, 451 P.2d 519 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a lessor of business property had the right to enter the premises because the lease had expired, three days’ notice was not required, since the notice requirement set forth in this section applies only where a lessor enters premises under a right of reentry. Ringer v. Rice, 97 Idaho 105, 540 P.2d 290 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the lessor gave the lessee notice of default on May 20, 1977, for his failure to pay the May, 1977 minimum rent and, on June 22, 1977, the lessee had still not cured the default, and the lessor sent a notice of termination, the lessee thus had more than the 30 days permitted in the lease to cure the default; and since no reentry was attempted by the lessor within three days of the termination notice the notice requirement of this section was met. Riverside Dev. Co. v. Ritchie, 103 Idaho 515, 650 P.2d 657 (1982).

        A tenant may remove from the demised premises, any time during the continuance of his term, anything affixed thereto for the purposes of trade, manufacture, ornament or domestic use, if the removal can be effected without injury to the premises, unless the thing has, by the manner in which it is affixed, become an integral part of the premises.

        Property consisting of a front and back bar, ice chest, etc., placed in a saloon building by tenant and fastened to the wall and floor, constitutes trade fixtures and may be removed by tenant during the continuance of his term. Bush v. Havird, 12 Idaho 352, 86 P. 529 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Accepting trial court’s determination that they were fixtures, a metal canopy or hood, soda fountain with compressor, stainless steel sink, air conditioner and special acid-resistant sink, installed by tenant operator of drug store, could be removed by tenant during operation of lease, not having become integral parts of the building, since removal involved no more than unscrewing attaching supports and removal of lines for electricity, water and drainage used for their service. Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a particular article has become a trade fixture, three general tests are applied: 1. annexation to the realty, either actual or constructive; 2. adaptation or application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty to which it is connected is appropriated; and, 3. intention to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold. Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964); Steel Farms, Inc. v. Croft & Reed, 154 Idaho 259, 297 P.3d 222 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision in lease requiring payment of $10.00 per day during the time possession is withheld, following default and 30-day notice, is indicative of tenant’s intent upon holding over; therefore, even though terms of the lease had expired, his possession was not more than a continuance of the original term, and tenant was entitled to remove trade fixtures which had not become an integral part of the premises and that could be removed without injury to the premises. Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964).
    Trial court found a dividing partition was so affixed that it became an integral part of leased building and that shelving, although not an integral part of building, could not be removed without injury to the building; therefore, tenant was not authorized to remove either partition or shelving. Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where pivot irrigation system was annexed to the land, either constructively or actually, in that it was bolted to cement slabs buried in the ground, and attached to pipes and electrical wires which were buried three to four feet underground and removal of the system necessitated digging up these buried wires and pipes, which could only result in some damage to the realty itself and such system was clearly adapted to the land since the purpose and use of the land in question was that of farming and irrigation is peculiarly necessary to a farming operation conducted in Idaho and where the gravity system in place before such system was installed was destroyed, indicating that it was no longer necessary to have the gravity system because of the permanent installation of another irrigation system, such system was a fixture. Rayl v. Shull Enters., Inc., 108 Idaho 524, 700 P.2d 567 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        An irrigation system as a whole is not necessarily a fixture, but may be personal property. The court must assess objective intent, annexation, and adaptation to determine intent. Steel Farms, Inc. v. Croft & Reed, Inc., 154 Idaho 259, 297 P.3d 222 (2012).

        Where the evidence presented at trial established that the equipment was very heavy and bolted to the mill and there was contradictory testimony as to whether the equipment could be removed from the mill without damage, but the jury could find that the equipment could be removed without harm to the structure, it was a question of fact for the jury to determine whether the equipment was removable under this section.

        Trade fixtures must be removed by tenant during continuance of his term; right to remove them is lost after a surrender of possession by tenant, or eviction by landlord by summary proceedings. Bush v. Havird, 12 Idaho 352, 86 P. 529 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        As long as a tenant remains in possession of premises and holds over term provided by the lease, which also provides for payment of a fixed sum for each day of holding over, he is still within the purview of the statute allowing him to remove his property “any time during the continuance of his term.” Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964).

        This section unambiguously permitted the relocation of an access road, and did not require the consent of the neighboring dominant estate holders; the relocation did not constitute a taking and there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the estate holders sustained an injury.

        As respects the right of irrigation district to recover damages from other districts for diversion of unused stored water in reservoir, districts which were not using water on their own land, but who were distributing appropriations to land owners and collecting rent therefor, were cotenants.

        Boundary Agreements.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the location of a true boundary line between coterminous owners is known to either of the parties, or is not uncertain, and is not in dispute, an oral agreement between them purporting to establish another line as the boundary between their properties constitutes an attempt to convey real property in violation of the statute of frauds. Downing v. Boehringer, 82 Idaho 52, 349 P.2d 306 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the location of the true boundary line between coterminous owners is unknown, uncertain or in dispute, the coterminous owners may orally agree upon a boundary line, and the agreement, when possession is taken under it, will be binding upon the owners and those claiming under them and will not violate the statute of frauds for lack of a writing because it is not a conveyance of land, but merely the locating and establishing of the common boundary. Hyde v. Lawson, 94 Idaho 886, 499 P.2d 1242 (1972), overruled on other grounds, Trappett v. Davis, 102 Idaho 527, 633 P.2d 592 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Idaho case law, presently and historically, would permit application of the oral agreement doctrine where the location of the true line is unknown to both property owners, even though they may not entertain uncertain or disputatious feelings about it, because the doctrine of boundary by agreement promotes practical and stable boundaries, while concurrently preventing property owners from engaging in oral transactions to convey land. Norwood v. Stevens, 104 Idaho 44, 655 P.2d 938 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In every case where a boundary by agreement is asserted, the underlying issue is whether such an agreement represents an oral conveyance of land in violation of the statute of frauds. The general rule of case law is that an agreement which arises from uncertainty or dispute over the location of a boundary is valid and does not constitute an oral conveyance of land. Norwood v. Stevens, 104 Idaho 44, 655 P.2d 938 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mediation agreement fell within the boundary agreement exception to statute of frauds, the elements of which are: (1) an uncertain or disputed boundary and (2) an express or implied agreement subsequently fixing that boundary. Goodman v. Lothrop, 143 Idaho 622, 151 P.3d 818 (2007).

When two recorded conveyances purport to convey conflicting interests in real property, the conveyance first recorded controls. Thus, where escrow agreement was recorded in 1989 and deed for sale of remainder of land owned by seller was recorded in 1991, the escrow agreement entitled buyer of the two acres to an easement of nonexclusive use of the airport even though the easement for nonexclusive use of the airport had been omitted from the deed for sale of the two acres.

       <p>
        When a subsequent encumbrancer or purchaser has actual knowledge of a prior interest, it makes no difference whether the prior interest was properly acknowledged and recorded. Farm Bureau Fin. Co. v. Carney, 100 Idaho 745, 605 P.2d 509 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Idaho’s recording statutes, a mortgage recorded first in time had priority against all other subsequent mortgagees where the title company executed and recorded its mortgage first (twelve days before the landowners) and the owners were not good faith purchasers because they knew of the company’s mortgage, such that because the owners did not record first and had at least constructive notice of the company’s mortgage, the company’s mortgage took priority. Estate of Skvorak v. Sec. Union Title Ins. Co., 140 Idaho 16, 89 P.3d 856 (2004).
    An unrecorded easement for a billboard was unenforceable, where the purchaser’s conversation with the seller, along with a signed lease, a warranty deed free of restrictions, and a title policy indicating that the property was free of encumbrances, showed that the purchaser did not have knowledge of the easement and had conducted a reasonable investigation. Tiller White, LLC v. Canyon Outdoor Media, LLC, 160 Idaho 417, 374 P.3d 580 (2016).

       <p>
        The fact that after decedent executed and delivered deed to plaintiff-grantee requesting that grantee have it recorded, decedent continued to live on one lot and collect rents from another was not enough to uphold trial court’s fact finding that decedent did not intend that a fee simple title should pass immediately.

        Unrecorded deed prevailed even though a creditor’s judgment was recorded first, because the judgment was not an “instrument” under this section. While the deed was an “invalid” deed — one not acknowledged and not recorded — it was, however, still valid as between the parties and took priority over the judgment. Siegel Mobile Home Group, Inc. v. Bowen, 114 Idaho 531, 757 P.2d 1250 (Ct. App. 1988).

        Owner of easement across 42-foot strip of land could not claim to be a bona fide purchaser based on vendors’ agreement to devise the strip to easement owner upon the death of surviving spouse, where, prior to parting with consideration for vendors’ promise to convey the strip in the future, easement owner had acquired actual knowledge of an earlier unrecorded contract wherein vendors granted defendants the preemptive right of first refusal if the strip was offered for sale.

        Shelter Rule.

       <p>
        The “Shelter Rule” provides that one who is not a bona fide purchaser, but who takes an interest in property from a bona fide purchaser, may be sheltered in the latter’s protective status; therefore, a bona fide purchaser can transfer good title to a person who has notice of a prior adverse equity or right. Sun Valley Land & Minerals, Inc. v. Burt, 123 Idaho 862, 853 P.2d 607 (Ct. App. 1993).
    There are two exceptions to the “Shelter Rule”: (1) where the interest held by a bona fide purchaser was obtained from a grantor with notice of an outstanding interest in the property, and the property is reconveyed to the grantor; and (2) when the property is reconveyed from a bona fide purchaser to a person guilty of a violation of a trust or duty with respect to the property. Sun Valley Land & Minerals, Inc. v. Burt, 123 Idaho 862, 853 P.2d 607 (Ct. App. 1993).

        A quitclaim deed was unenforceable as a matter of law, where it did not contain an adequate description of the property, the grantee had submitted inconsistent determinations of the boundaries and acreage of the property, the grantors did not have authority to convey the subject property when the grantee attempted to record the deed, and extrinsic evidence could not be used to determine the sufficiency of the description.

      From the use of the word “grant” in any conveyance by which an estate of inheritance, possessory right, or fee simple is to be passed, the following covenants, and none other, on the part of the grantor, for himself and his heirs, to the grantee, his heirs and assigns, are implied, unless restrained by express terms contained in such conveyance:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t55c06s55-612ol11">
       That previous to the time of the execution of such conveyance, the grantor has not conveyed the same estate, or any right, title or interest therein, to any person other than the grantee.
      </li>
      <li id="t55c06s55-612ol12">
       That such estate is at the time of the execution of such conveyance free from encumbrances done, made or suffered by the grantor, or any person claiming under him. Such covenants may be sued upon in the same manner as if they had been expressly inserted in the conveyance.

        Encumbrance is not contemplated by this section, unless grantor was under personal obligation to pay it. Polak v. Mattson, 22 Idaho 727, 128 P. 89 (1912).

        Unless grantee agrees to pay taxes levied prior to his acquisition of title, same are not encumbrances herein. Polak v. Mattson, 22 Idaho 727, 128 P. 89 (1912).

       <p>
        This section implies that, when the word “grant” is used in a deed, the estate conveyed is free from encumbrances of the grantor or any one claiming under him. Where the claimant of a mechanic’s lien on the premises for services and materials furnished under a contract conveyed, by a grant deed, such premises to the party against whom the lien was asserted, the claim of lien for services and materials rendered prior to the delivery of the deed was “merged” in the deed which rendered the claim unenforceable in the absence of a reservation of the title. Finlayson v. Waller, 64 Idaho 618, 134 P.2d 1069 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of “encumbrance” does not include an alleged restriction on the use of the property. Middlekauff v. Lake Cascade, Inc., 103 Idaho 832, 654 P.2d 1385 (1982).

       <p>
        The word “grant” in a conveyance is a covenant that the estate so conveyed is, at the time of the execution thereof, free from encumbrances done, made or suffered by grantor or any person claiming under him, but is not a warranty of title or a covenant of quiet enjoyment against encumbrances. Warren v. Stoddart, 6 Idaho 692, 59 P. 540 (1899); Moore v. Pooley, 17 Idaho 57, 104 P. 898 (1909).

        Covenant of seizin is not implied from use of word “grant” in deed. Bliss Townsite Co. v. Morris-Roberts Co., 33 Idaho 110, 190 P. 1028 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Implied warranty against encumbrances from use of word “grant” is a covenant running with the land. Brinton v. Johnson, 35 Idaho 656, 208 P. 1028 (1922); Carssow v. Brinton, 35 Idaho 667, 208 P. 1031 (1922).

       <p>
        Word “grant” in a deed of conveyance implies a covenant against an encumbrance of a tax lien “done, made, or suffered” by grantor which runs with the land. Brinton v. Johnson, 35 Idaho 656, 208 P. 1028 (1922); Carssow v. Brinton, 35 Idaho 667, 208 P. 1031 (1922).

        Since the alleged promise of seller that certain property adjoining that of purchasers would be reserved for common use was not a lien or encumbrance, order of bankruptcy court authorizing sale of part of such property “free and clear of all liens and encumbrances” did not put the purchasers on notice of fraud and did not start the statute of limitations running on purchasers’ action to enforce the promise.

        Notice contemplated by the recording statutes is not a publication to the world, but only notice to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers. Maxwell v. Twin Falls Canal Co., 49 Idaho 806, 292 P. 232 (1930).

       <p>
        The primary purpose of the recording statute is to give notice to others that an interest is claimed in real property and, thus, to give protection against bona fide third parties who may be dealing in the same property. Matheson v. Harris, 98 Idaho 758, 572 P.2d 861 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        If minor errors or omissions are made in the recording of an interest in real property, the minor errors could be overlooked if the recorded instrument gives enough notice to subsequent purchasers.

       <p>
        A certificate of acknowledgment complete and regular on its face raises a presumption in favor of the truth of every fact recited therein, which the uncorroborated testimony of the party acknowledging the instrument is insufficient to overcome, and the additional affidavit of the notary that he could not recall any of the circumstances surrounding the execution and acknowledgment of an instrument, although it had sometimes been his practice to take an acknowledgment in the absence of the signing party, was insufficient to impeach the validity of the acknowledgment.

        The manifest intent of the legislature in requiring a notary public to execute a certificate of acknowledgment is to provide protection against the recording of false instruments; the sine qua non of this statutory requirement is the involvement of the notary, a public officer, in a position of public trust.

       </p>
       <p>
        Claims of mechanics’ and materialmen’s liens filed under Title 45, Chapter 5 of the Idaho Code must be acknowledged in accord with this section before they are entitled to be recorded, and the “verification” required under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.45.html#t45c05s45-507" target="_blank">§ 45-507 </a></cite>does not serve the same purpose or function of an “acknowledgment” and cannot be a substitute therefor; accordingly, liens that were not acknowledged, or acknowledged but where the certificate of acknowledgment did not substantially comply with Title 55, Chapter 7 of the Idaho Code, were not enforceable against the bankruptcy trustee.

        The primary purpose of recording is to give notice to others that an interest is claimed in real property; an instrument recorded without an acknowledgment or with a defective acknowledgment is not entitled to be recorded and cannot impart constructive notice.

       <p>
        District court erred in finding that a memorandum of sale was properly acknowledged and recorded, because the notary’s endorsement of the memorandum was not a certificate used for acknowledgments, but was the endorsement used for oaths and affirmations. The deficiency could not be cured by reference to the instrument. Salladay v. Bowen, 161 Idaho 563, 388 P.3d 577 (2017).

        Recording rule in this section does not apply where an instrument, signed by an attorney in fact, merely names a new trustee under the trust deed. All that appointment does is change the identity of a previously established trustee. No interest in real property is altered in any way, as the trust deed already established the trustee’s rights and duties. Gordon v. United States Bank Nat’l Ass’n, — Idaho —, 455 P.3d 374 (2019).

        While the filing and recording of a deed executed by grantor’s attorney in fact, before the filing and recording of power of attorney, does not necessarily render the deed void, as between the parties, in the absence of intervening rights, it does not constitute constructive notice to subsequent purchasers of the land conveyed.

        In property owner’s action challenging a non-judicial foreclosure action taken on the deed of trust securing a note on the subject property, the failure to record a power of attorney under this section did not invalidate a change in trustees of the note. The purpose of the recording statutes is to provide notice to subsequent purchasers: the property owner was not a subsequent purchaser, and he was on notice of the change in the power of attorney status by other instruments that were recorded. Purdy v. Bank of Am., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140935 (D. Idaho Sept. 26, 2012).

Therefore, defendant was, by law, on notice the recorded third replat contained a note which identified the master plan on file in the planning office of the county, and thus, this recorded instrument gave defendant notice that he could only build an additional eighteen (18) units in a block of the development.

    According to Idaho’s recording statutes, a mortgage recorded first in time had priority against all other subsequent mortgagees where the title company executed and recorded its mortgage first (twelve days before the landowners) and the owners were not good faith purchasers because they knew of the company’s mortgage, such that because the owners did not record first and had at least constructive notice of the company’s mortgage, the company’s mortgage took priority.

        An unrecorded easement for a billboard was unenforceable, where the purchaser’s conversation with the seller, along with a signed lease, a warranty deed free of restrictions, and a title policy indicating that the property was free of encumbrances, showed that the purchaser did not have knowledge of the easement and had conducted a reasonable investigation.

        One who has notice or knowledge of a previous sale of real property, or who has notice or knowledge of such facts and circumstances as would lead a reasonably prudent man to discover that a previous sale had been made, is not a purchaser in good faith within the meaning of this section; but one who purchases vacant property and procures an abstract of title which fails to show a previous conveyance, because the same was not recorded, and pays the purchase-price without any knowledge of such previous conveyance, is a purchaser in good faith and is entitled to the property as against holder of the prior unrecorded deed. Froman v. Madden, 13 Idaho 138, 88 P. 894 (1907).
    Defense of good faith cannot be used to create a title, where not even a defective title exists. Ewald v. Hufton, 31 Idaho 373, 173 P. 247 (1918).

        Owner of easement across 42-foot strip of land could not claim to be a bona fide purchaser based on vendors’ agreement to devise the strip to easement owner upon the death of surviving spouse, where prior to parting with consideration for vendors’ promise to convey the strip in the future easement owner had acquired actual knowledge of an earlier unrecorded contract wherein vendors granted defendants the preemptive right of first refusal if the strip was offered for sale.

        It is possible for a subsequent purchaser to acquire a paramount title through the medium of the recording laws, relegating prior purchaser to an action for damages against vendor. Madden v. Caldwell Land Co., 16 Idaho 59, 100 P. 358 (1909).

        Protection afforded by the recording acts is purely statutory and is not to be extended beyond their reasonable import. They do not apply where a title vests by virtue of law and not through a conveyance. Ewald v. Hufton, 31 Idaho 373, 173 P. 247 (1918).

        Escrow agreement in which buyer promised to pay a certain sum to seller in return for two acres and various interests in the land including nonexclusive use of airport was a conveyance within the meaning of this section, and when two recorded conveyances purport to convey conflicting interests in real property, the conveyance first recorded controls. Thus, where escrow agreement was recorded in 1989 and deed for sale of remainder of land owned by seller was recorded in 1991, the escrow agreement entitled buyer of the two acres to an easement of nonexclusive use of the airport even though the easement for nonexclusive use of the airport had been omitted from the deed for sale of the two acres.

        A lease for more than one year or a mortgage is such a conveyance or encumbrance that it falls within the prohibition that a husband acting as agent for the community cannot execute same unless his wife joins with him in executing the instrument.

        A “mortgage” is a “conveyance,” within the meaning of statutory definition of term “conveyance,” and is included within the scope of statute invalidating conveyances of realty to foreign corporations failing to comply with statutory requirements for doing business within state, notwithstanding a mortgage does not pass title to mortgaged property.

        Plats and the Master Plan, which were on file in the proper office and were properly acknowledged and certified, imparted notice of their contents to defendant, the subsequent purchaser. Therefore defendant was, by law, on notice the recorded third replat contained Note 6 which identified the Master Plan on file in the planning office of the county, and thus, this recorded instrument gave defendant notice that he could only build an additional eighteen (18) units in Block 3 in a cluster configuration as located on the third replat.

        Record of survey constituted a properly recorded conveyance; where it purported to transfer the disputed property, it created, alienated, mortgaged or encumbered the title of both lots, it was in writing, it contained a sufficient description of the property, it contained the name of the grantee, and it clearly indicated the legal description of the subject property and the lots.

        A notice of default recorded by the trustee is not a “conveyance” under this section; therefore, the alleged failure to record the power of attorney held by trustee for bank defendant does not invalidate the non-judicial foreclosure process by the bank defendants. It is the recording of the original deed of trust that provided notice of conveyance and a mortgage interest in debtor’s property to all subsequent purchasers and mortgagees. Purdy v.

        Execution and delivery of trust deed by father, who was experiencing business difficulties, to daughter, creating first mortgage lien on father’s property in favor of daughter, was not a fraudulent conveyance where the deed was given for adequate consideration, consisting of prior advances and expenditures by daughter, and where evidence presented by judgment creditor of father failed to establish actual fraud or “badges of fraud” from which an inference of actual fraud might be warranted.

        Where a title to an Idaho mining claim was conveyed to an Arizona corporation, the law of Arizona would control the rights and liabilities of the corporation, as respects avoidance of the conveyance for fraud in representing that the stock would be fully paid and nonassessable, unless the Arizona law was contrary to the public policy of Idaho.

        A conveyance of Idaho mining claims to an Arizona corporation was not subject to attack for fraud in procurement on the ground that the representation that the stock in the Arizona corporation would be fully paid and nonassessable was contrary to law and incapable of performance in the absence of a showing of the Arizona statute or a decision invalidating such a promise, since, under the rule prevailing in Idaho, such a contract would be upheld.

       </p>
       <p>
        Inference of actual fraud in connection with transfer from father to daughter was not warranted by informality of the transaction, time gap between execution and recording of trust deed and financial difficulty of father where informality naturally resulted from close relationship, the deed was recorded promptly on delivery to daughter and the deed was supported by adequate consideration.

    Where authority to continue business is given chiefly for benefit of debtor or is intended to hinder and delay creditors for unreasonable period, transfer is fraudulent and void. Rogers v. Boise Ass’n. of Credit Men, 33 Idaho 513, 196 P. 213 (1921).

       <p>
        Although the existence of a close relationship between debtor and transferee invites close scrutiny, it is not a “badge of fraud” per se and must be supplemented by other proof of bad faith to establish a prima facie case of fraud.

        That a bankrupt national bank stockholder, who conveyed his property to his wife long prior to the closing of the bank, thereafter paid taxes, collected rents and directed operation of said property, does not estop the wife from resisting an attempt of the trustee in bankruptcy of the husband to set aside the conveyances as in fraud of creditors.

       <p>
        Proof that a husband and wife considered the wife’s participation in, or contribution to, the purchase of land resulted in debt to be repaid by husband or wife from community is insufficient to sustain burden of proof that subsequent conveyance of property to the son was not fraudulent.

        In an action to set aside fraudulent conveyances, evidence that execution on plaintiff’s judgment was returned unsatisfied was admissible to show the financial condition of grantors at the time of the conveyance, in the absence of evidence of material change therein between the time of the conveyance and the time of the return of the execution, other than asserted fraudulent transfers and disposition of limited amount of personal property. Buhl State Bank v. Glander, 56 Idaho 543, 56 P.2d 757 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to set aside fraudulent conveyances, evidence of conversation with grantor, subsequent to the conveyances, as to his purpose and intent in making transfers, was admissible to negative validity of transfers, where the evidence supported a finding that the grantees participated in fraud.

        Where the evidence showed that the owner of land, allegedly to secure payment of debts, conveyed it to a purported creditor, who immediately reconveyed it without consideration to a corporation of which the original grantor and his wife were the principal stockholders, that this purported creditor later mortgaged the land to the corporation and payments on the mortgage were transferred by the corporation to a bank in payment of personal debts of the original grantor, and the land was again conveyed by the purported creditor to the corporation in consideration of the satisfaction of said mortgage and a prior mortgage by the purported creditor to an insurance company, such transactions constituted “badges of fraud” from which the trial court could find that the final conveyance to the corporation was in fraud of the creditors of the original grantor.

        Where a bankrupt’s possible future liability on his national bank stock constituted the sole basis of a claim that the bankrupt had existing creditors at the time of the alleged fraudulent conveyances, such conveyances could not be set aside as fraudulent, where there was no evidence that at the time of the conveyances, the bank was insolvent, or that the bankrupt knew of such insolvency. Kester v. Helmer, 16 F. Supp. 260 (D. Idaho 1935), aff’d, 85 F.2d 646 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 299 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 234, 81 L. Ed. 448 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possible future liability of a bankrupt national bank stockholder does not make either the bank or the bank’s creditors creditors of the bankrupt at the time of the execution of the alleged fraudulent conveyances several years prior to the closing of the bank, so as to justify setting such conveyances aside, where the bankrupt had no other creditors at the time of the conveyance, since liability on the bank stock did not arise until the comptroller made an assessment. Kester v. Helmer, 16 F. Supp. 260 (D. Idaho 1935), aff’d, 85 F.2d 646 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 299 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 234, 81 L. Ed. 448 (1936).

        Inference of actual fraud in connection with transfer from father to daughter was not warranted by informality of the transaction, time gap between execution and recording of trust deed and financial difficulty of father where informality naturally resulted from close relationship, the deed was recorded promptly on delivery to daughter and the deed was supported by adequate consideration.

       <p>
        Every transfer of personal property other than a thing in action, and every lien thereon, other than [a] any transfer in connection with security interest created under the Uniform Commercial Code, is presumed, if made by a person having at the time the possession or control of the property, and not accompanied by an immediate delivery and followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things transferred, to be fraudulent, and therefore void, against those who are his creditors while he remains in possession, and the successors in interests of such creditor, and against any persons on whom his estate devolves in trust for the benefit of others than himself, and against purchasers or encumbrancers in good faith subsequent to the transfer.

        Where horses pledged to secure a debt are at time of pledge in the possession of a third person who was to range the same for the winter, and pledgor tells such third person in the presence of all parties to hold them for pledgee, and such person takes the horses to the range and delivers them to pledgee in the spring, the latter paying for their care during the winter, there is a sufficient delivery and change of possession to satisfy the statute.

        No fixed rule can be established as a test for determining what the “immediate delivery” or “actual possession” required by the statute means, but the questions are matters of fact to be determined by the jury from the evidence in each particular case.

        Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Intent with which a transfer in fraud of creditors is made is not established so much by attempting to ascertain the actual intent in mind of debtor, but rather by the facts and circumstances under which transfer was made and from which the law imputes a fraudulent motive. California Consol. Mining Co. v. Manley, 10 Idaho 786, 81 P. 50 (1905), appeal dismissed, 203 U.S. 579, 27 S. Ct. 779, 51 L. Ed. 326 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a conveyance is for the purpose of defrauding creditors is a question of intent. Lingenfelter v. Eby, 68 Idaho 134, 190 P.2d 130 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        A fraudulent intent may be imputed by the conditions and circumstances of the transfer. Siegel Mobile Home Group, Inc. v. Bowen, 114 Idaho 531, 757 P.2d 1250 (Ct. App. 1988).
    The lack of an acknowledgment on the first deed to the wife, subsequent multiple conveyances of the property, and the coincidence of the timing of these transfers and the judgment of the pending case against the husband, did not create a showing from which conflicting inferences of the husband’s intent could be drawn, where the affidavits given by the husband and wife, as well as the records in the divorce action, established the stated purpose of the deed as a settlement of the property dispute arising from their earlier divorce. Siegel Mobile Home Group, Inc. v. Bowen, 114 Idaho 531, 757 P.2d 1250 (Ct. App. 1988).

        Neither gift from husband to wife nor conveyance to another without consideration is prima facie fraudulent. McMillan v. McMillan, 42 Idaho 270, 245 P. 98 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to constitute fraudulent conveyance, there must be shown the fraud of vendor and injury to creditor. McMillan v. McMillan, 42 Idaho 270, 245 P. 98 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Transfer pending determination of contingent liability was held a fraud on creditors, as a matter of law. Associated Fruit Co. v. Idaho-Oregon Fruit Growers’ Ass’n, 44 Idaho 200, 256 P. 99 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        When insolvent debtor conveys all his property without consideration, inevitable result is to hinder and delay creditors. He is held to intend natural consequences of his act and natural inference is intent to defraud, in absence of circumstances that rebut that inference. Snell v.

        Determination of what constitutes immediate change of possession and delivery is purely a question of fact to be determined by the jury, or the court in case a jury is waived, from all the evidence in the particular case. Rapple v. Hughes, 10 Idaho 338, 77 P. 722 (1904).

        Refusal of mortgagee to release six chattel mortgages could not be excused on the ground that there was no consideration for one of the mortgages, since a mortgage is not fraudulent merely because there is lack of consideration, and, furthermore, question of fraud can only be raised by the creditors in a proper proceeding.

        Transfer of property from husband to wife is not fraudulent, if husband had sufficient remaining property to pay his debts. McMillan v. McMillan, 42 Idaho 270, 245 P. 98 (1926); Snell v. Prescott, 48 Idaho 783, 285 P. 483 (1930).

         The definition of “asset” is substantially to the same effect as the definition of “assets” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The definition in this Act, unlike that in the earlier Act, does not, however, require a determination that the property is liable for the debts of the debtor. Thus, for example, an unliquidated claim for damages resulting from personal injury or a contingent claim of a surety for reimbursement, subrogation, restitution, contribution, or the like may be counted as an asset for the purpose of determining whether the holder of the claim is solvent as a debtor under § 2 of this Act, even if applicable law does not allow such an asset to be levied on and sold by a creditor.

         The definition of “claim” is derived from Bankruptcy Code § 101(4) (1984). Because the purpose of this Act is primarily to protect unsecured creditors against transfers and obligations injurious to their rights, the words “claim” and “debt” as used in the Act generally have reference to an unsecured claim and debt. As the context may indicate, however, usage of the terms is not so restricted. See,
    e.g.
    , §§ 1(1)(i)(B) and 1(9).

         The definition of “insider” is derived from Bankruptcy Code § 101(28) (1984). In this Act, as in the Bankruptcy Code, the definition states that the term “includes” certain listed persons; it does not state that the term “means” the listed persons. Hence the definition is not exclusive, and the statutory list is merely exemplary. See also Bankruptcy Code § 102(3) (1984). Accordingly, a person may be an “insider” of a debtor that is an individual, corporation or partnership even though the person is not designated as such by the statutory list. For example, a trust may be found to be an “insider” of a beneficiary. Similarly, a court may find a person living with an individual debtor for an extended time in the same household or as a permanent companion to have the kind of close relationship intended to be covered by the term “insider.” See also,
    e.g., Browning Interests v. Allison (In re Holloway)
    , 955 F.2d 1008 (5th Cir. 1992) (former spouse of debtor was an “insider” because of their close and continued personal relationship, even though they had long ago divorced and remarried others). Likewise, a person may be an “insider” of a debtor that is not an individual, corporation or partnership. See,
    
     e.g., In re Longview Aluminum, L.L.C.
    
    , 657 F.3d 507 (7th Cir. 2011) (holding, under the Bankruptcy Code definition, that an individual serving on the Board of Managers of, and having a 12% membership interest in, a limited liability company was an “insider” of the company; the company’s organic documents vested management authority “in the Board of Managers and the Members”).

         The definition of “transfer” is derived principally from Bankruptcy Code § 101(48) (1984). The definition of “conveyance” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was similarly comprehensive, and the references in this Act to “payment of money, release, lease, and the creation of a lien or encumbrance” are derived from the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. While the definition in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act did not explicitly refer to an involuntary transfer, the decisions under that Act were generally consistent with an interpretation that covered such a transfer. See,
    e.g., Hearn 45 St. Corp. v. Jano

         The definition of “valid lien” had no analogue in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. A valid lien includes an equitable lien that may not be defeated by a judicial lien creditor. See,
    e.g., Pearlman v. Reliance Insurance Co.
    , 371 U.S. 132, 136 (1962) (upholding a surety’s equitable lien in respect to a fund owing a bankrupt contractor).
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) provide clarification by excluding from the term not only generally exempt property but also an interest in a tenancy by the entirety in many states and an interest that is generally beyond reach by unsecured creditors because subject to a valid lien. This Act, like the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, declares rights and provides remedies for unsecured creditors against transfers that impede them in the collection of their claims. The laws protecting valid liens against impairment by levying creditors, exemption statutes, and the rules restricting levyability of interest in entireties property are limitations on the rights and remedies of unsecured creditors, and it is therefore appropriate to exclude property interests that are beyond the reach of unsecured creditors from the definition of “asset” for the purposes of this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        A creditor of a joint tenant or tenant in common may ordinarily collect a judgment by process against the tenant’s interest, and in some states a creditor of a tenant by the entirety may likewise collect a judgment by process against the tenant’s interest. See 2 American Law of Property 10, 22, 28-32 (1952); Craig,
    An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy
    , 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258-59 (1974). The levyable interest of such a tenant is included as an asset under this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of “assets” in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act excluded property that is exempt from liability for debts. The definition did not, however, exclude all property that cannot be reached by a creditor through judicial proceedings to collect a debt. Thus, it included the interest of a tenant by the entirety although in nearly half the states such an interest cannot be subjected to liability for a debt unless it is an obligation owed jointly by the debtor with his or her cotenant by the entirety. See 2 American Law of Property 29 (1952); Craig,
    An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy
    , 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258 (1974). The definition in this Act requires exclusion of interests in property held by tenants by the entirety that are not subject to collection process by a creditor without a right to proceed against both tenants by the entirety as joint debtors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reference to “generally exempt” property in § 1(2)(ii) recognizes that all exemptions are subject to exceptions. Creditors having special rights against generally exempt property typically include claimants for alimony, taxes, wages, the purchase price of the property, and labor or materials that improve the property. See Uniform Exemptions Act § 10 (1979) and the accompanying Comment. The fact that a particular creditor may reach generally exempt property by resorting to judicial process does not warrant its inclusion as an asset in determining whether the debtor is insolvent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because this Act is not an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations (see Comment 9 to § 4), it does not preclude the holder of a claim that may be collected by process against property generally exempt as to other creditors from obtaining relief from a transfer of such property that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim. Likewise the holder of an unsecured claim enforceable against tenants by the entirety is not precluded by the Act from pursuing a remedy against a transfer of property held by the entirety that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonbankruptcy law is the law of a state or federal law that is not part of the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code. The definition of an “asset” thus does not include property that would be subject to administration for the benefit of creditors under the Bankruptcy Code unless it is subject under other applicable law, state or federal, to process for the collection of a creditor’s claim against a single debtor.
       </p>
       <p>
        The differences between the definition in this Act and that in the Bankruptcy Code are slight. In this Act, the definition has been restricted in clauses (i)(C), (ii)(E), and (iii)(D) to make clear that a partner is not an insider of an individual, corporation, or partnership if any of these latter three persons is only a limited partner. The definition of “insider” in the Bankruptcy Code does not purport to make a limited partner an insider of the partners or of the partnership with which the limited partner is associated, but it is susceptible of a contrary interpretation and one which would extend unduly the scope of the defined relationship when the limited partner is not a person in control of the partnership. The definition of “insider” in this Act also omits the reference in Bankruptcy Code § 101(28)(D) (1984) to an elected official or relative of such an official as an insider of a municipality.

       PREFATORY NOTE (2014 AMENDMENTS)
      </h4>
      <p>
       In 2014 the Uniform Law Commission approved a set of amendments to the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. The amendments changed the title of the Act to the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act. The amendment project was instituted to address a small number of narrowly-defined issues, and was not a comprehensive revision. The principal features of the amendments are listed below. Further explanation of provisions added or revised by the amendments may be found in the comments to those provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Choice of Law.
    The amendments add a new § 10, which sets forth a choice of law rule applicable to claims for relief of the nature governed by the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidentiary Matters.
    New §§ 4(c), 5(c), 8(g), and 8(h) add uniform rules allocating the burden of proof and defining the standard of proof with respect to claims for relief and defenses under the Act. Language in the former comments to § 2 relating to the presumption of insolvency created by § 2(b) has been moved to the text of that provision, the better to assure its uniform application.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deletion of the Special Definition of “Insolvency” for Partnerships.
    Section 2(c) of the Act as originally written set forth a special definition of “insolvency” applicable to partnerships. The amendments delete original § 2(c), with the result that the general definition of “insolvency” in § 2(a) now applies to partnerships. One reason for this change is that original § 2(c) gave a partnership full credit for the net worth of each of its general partners. That makes sense only if each general partner is liable for all debts of the partnership, but such is not necessarily the case under modern partnership statutes. A more fundamental reason is that the general definition of “insolvency” in § 2(a) does not credit a non-partnership debtor with any part of the net worth of its guarantors. To the extent that a general partner is liable for the debts of the partnership, that liability is analogous to that of a guarantor. There is no good reason to define “insolvency” differently for a partnership debtor than for a non-partnership debtor whose debts are guaranteed by contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Defenses.
    The amendments refine in relatively minor respects several provisions relating to defenses available to a transferee or obligee, as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t55c09s55-910-PREFATORYNOTE(2014AMENDMENTS)ol11">
        As originally written, § 8(a) created a complete defense to an action under § 4(a)(1) (which renders voidable a transfer made or obligation incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor) if the transferee or obligee takes in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value. The amendments add to § 8(a) the further requirement that the reasonably equivalent value must be given the debtor.
    (2) Section 8(b), derived from Bankruptcy Code §§ 550(a), (b) (1984), creates a defense for a subsequent transferee (that is, a transferee other than the first transferee) that takes in good faith and for value, and for any subsequent good-faith transferee from such a person.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The amendments clarify the meaning of § 8(b) by rewording it to follow more closely the wording of Bankruptcy Code §§ 550(a), (b) (which is substantially unchanged as of 2014). Among other things, the amendments make clear that the defense applies to recovery of or from the transferred property or its proceeds, by levy or otherwise, as well as to an action for a money judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Section 8(e)(2) as originally written created a defense to an action under § 4(a)(2) or § 5 to avoid a transfer if the transfer results from enforcement of a security interest in compliance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The amendments exclude from that defense acceptance of collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures (a remedy sometimes referred to as “strict foreclosure”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Series Organizations.
    A new § 11 provides that each “protected series” of a “series organization” is to be treated as a person for purposes of the Act, even if it is not treated as a person for other purposes. This change responds to the emergence of the “series organization” as a significant form of business organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medium
    Neutrality. In order to accommodate modern technology, the references in the Act to a “writing” have been replaced with “record,” and related changes made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Style.
    The amendments make a number of stylistic changes that are not intended to change the meaning of the Act. For example, the amended Act consistently uses the word “voidable” to denote a transfer or obligation for which the Act provides a remedy. As originally written the Act sometimes inconsistently used the word “fraudulent.” No change in meaning is intended. See § 15, Comment 4. Likewise, the retitling of the Act is not intended to change its meaning. See § 15, Comment 1.

       <ol>
        <li id="t55c09s55-911-citedol11">
         Subsection (a) is derived from the definition of “insolvent” in Bankruptcy Code § 101(29)(A) (1984). The definition in subsection (a) contemplates a fair valuation of the debts as well as the assets of the debtor. The 2014 amendments reword subsection (a) in order to eliminate the elegant variation in the original text between “the sum of” debts and “all of” assets, and to make clearer that “fair valuation” applies to debts as well as to assets. No change in meaning is intended.
    Financial accounting standards may permit or require fair value measurement of an asset or a debt. The fair value of an asset or a debt for financial accounting purposes may be based on standards that are not appropriate for use in subsection (a). For example, Fin. Accounting Standards Bd., Accounting Standards Codification /P¶ 820-10-35-17 to -18 (2014) (formerly
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157: Fair Value Measurement
    ¶ 15 (2006)) requires for financial accounting purposes that the “fair value” of a liability reflect nonperformance risk (
    
     i.e.
    
    , the risk that the debtor will not pay the liability as and when due). By contrast, proper application of subsection (a) excludes any adjustment to the face amount of a liability on account of nonperformance risk. Such an adjustment would be contrary to the purpose of subsection (a), which is to assess the risk that the debtor will not be able to satisfy its liabilities. Only in unusual circumstances would the “fair valuation” for the purpose of subsection (a) of a liquidated debt be other than its face amount. Examples of such circumstances include discounting the face amount of a contingent debt to reflect the probability that the contingency will not occur, and discounting the face amount of a non-interest-bearing debt that is due in the future in order to reduce the debt to its present value.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-911-citedol12">
         Subsection (b) establishes a rebuttable presumption of insolvency from the fact of general nonpayment of debts as they become due. Such general nonpayment is a ground for the filing of an involuntary petition under Bankruptcy Code § 303(h)(1) (1978). See also U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c02s1-201" target="_blank">§ 1-201</a></cite>(23) (1962) (defining a person to be “insolvent” who “has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business”). The 2014 amendments to this Act clarify that general nonpayment of debts does not count nonpayment as a result of a bona fide dispute. That was the intended meaning of the language before 2014, as stated in the official comments, and the cited provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the Uniform Commercial Code have been similarly clarified. See Bankruptcy Code § 303(h)(1) (2014); U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c02s1-203" target="_blank">§ 1-203</a></cite>(b)(23) (2014) (defining “insolvent” to include “having generally ceased to pay debts in the ordinary course of business other than as a result of bona fide dispute”).
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-911-citedol13">
         Subsection (c) follows the approach of the definition of “insolvency” in Bankruptcy Code § 101(29) (1984) by excluding from the computation of the value of the debtor’s assets any value that can be realized only by avoiding a transfer of an interest formerly held by the debtor or by discovery or pursuit of property that has been concealed or removed with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-911-citedol14">
         Subsection (d) has no analogue in Bankruptcy Code § 101(29) (1984). It makes clear that a person is not rendered insolvent under this section by counting as a debt an obligation secured by property of the debtor that is not counted as an asset. See also Comment 2 to § 1 and Comment 1 to § 2.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        As under the definition of the term “insolvent” in § 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, exempt property is excluded from the computation of the value of the assets. See § 1(2). For similar reasons interests in valid spendthrift trusts and interests in tenancies by the entireties that are not subject to process by a creditor of only one tenant are not included. See Comment 2 to § 1. Because a valid lien also precludes an unsecured creditor from collecting the creditor’s claim from the encumbered interest in a debtor’s property, both the encumbered interest and the debt secured thereby are excluded from the computation of insolvency under this Act. See § 1(2) and subsection (d) of this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) defines the effect of the presumption to be (in paraphrase) that the burden of persuasion on the issue of insolvency shifts to the defendant. That conforms to the default definition of the effect of a presumption in civil cases set forth in Uniform Rules of Evidence (1974 Act), Rule 301(a) (later Rule 302(a) (1999 Act as amended 2005)). It also conforms to the Final Draft of Federal Rule 301 as submitted to the United States Supreme Court by the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Evidence in 1973. “The so-called ‘bursting bubble’ theory, under which a presumption vanishes upon the introduction of evidence which would support a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact, even though not believed, is rejected as according presumptions too ‘slight and evanescent’ an effect.” Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 301, 56 F.R.D. 183, 208 (1973). See also 1 J. Weinstein & M. Berger, Evidence ¶ 301[01] (1982). It should be noted that the Federal Rule of Evidence as finally enacted gave by default a different effect to presumptions in civil cases, in effect adopting the “bursting bubble” definition. See Fed. R. Evid. 301 (1975) (carried forward in the 2011 revision). The statement of the effect of the presumption in subsection (b) was added by the 2014 amendments to this Act, but subsection (b) was intended to have the same meaning before 2014, as stated in the official comments.
    The presumption is established in recognition of the difficulties typically imposed on a creditor in proving insolvency in the bankruptcy sense, as provided in subsection (a). See generally Levit,
    The Archaic Concept of Balance-Sheet Insolvency
    , 47 Am.Bankr.L.J. 215 (1973). Not only is the relevant information in the possession of a debtor that is apt to be noncooperative, but the debtor’s records are apt to be incomplete and inaccurate. As a practical matter, insolvency is most cogently evidenced by a general cessation of payment of debts, as has long been recognized by the laws of other countries and is now reflected in the Bankruptcy Code. See Honsberger,
        Failure to Pay One’s Debts Generally as They Become Due: The Experience of France and Canada
        , 54 Am.Bankr.L.J. 153 (1980); J. MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 13, 63-64, 436 (1956). In determining whether a debtor is paying its debts generally as they become due, the court should look at more than the amount and due dates of the indebtedness. The court should also take into account such factors as the number of the debtor’s debts, the proportion of those debts not being paid, the duration of the nonpayment, and the existence of bona fide disputes or other special circumstances alleged to constitute an explanation for the stoppage of payments. The court’s determination may be affected by a consideration of the debtor’s payment practices prior to the period of alleged nonpayment and the payment practices of the trade or industry in which the debtor is engaged. The case law that has developed under Bankruptcy Code § 303(h)(1) (1984) has not required a showing that a debtor has failed or refused to pay a majority in number and amount of the debtor’s debts in order to prove general nonpayment of debts as they become due. See,
        e.g., Hill v. Cargill, Inc. (In re Hill)
        , 8 B.R. 779, 3 C.B.C.2d 920 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1981) (nonpayment of three largest debts held to constitute general nonpayment, although small debts were being paid);
        In re All Media Properties, Inc.
        , 5 B.R. 126, 6 B.C.D. 586, 2 C.B.C.2d 449 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 1980) (missing significant number of payments or regularly missing payments significant in amount said to constitute general nonpayment; missing payments on more than 50% of aggregate of claims said not to be required to show general nonpayment; nonpayment for more than 30 days after billing held to establish nonpayment of a debt when it is due);
        In re Kreidler Import Corp.
        , 4 B.R. 256, 6 B.C.D. 608, 2 C.B.C.2d 159 (Bankr. D. Md. 1980) (nonpayment of one debt constituting 97% of debtor’s total indebtedness held to constitute general nonpayment).

         This section defines when “value” is given for a transfer or an obligation. “Value” is used in that sense in various contexts in this Act, frequently with a qualifying adjective. Used in that sense the word appears in the following provisions:
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-912-CASENOTESol12">
         Section 3(a) is adapted from Bankruptcy Code § 548(d)(2)(A) (1984). See also § 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The definition in Section 3 is not exclusive. “Value” is to be determined in light of the purpose of the Act to protect a debtor’s estate from being depleted to the prejudice of the debtor’s unsecured creditors. Consideration having no utility from a creditor’s viewpoint does not satisfy the statutory definition. The definition does not specify all the kinds of consideration that do not constitute value for the purposes of this Act —
    e.g.
    , love and affection. See,
    
     e.g., United States v. West
    
    , 299 F. Supp. 661, 666 (D. Del. 1969).

        <li id="t55c09s55-912-CASENOTESol13">
         Section 3(a) does not indicate what is “reasonably equivalent value” for a transfer or obligation. Under this Act, as under Bankruptcy Code § 548(a)(2) (1984), a transfer for security is ordinarily for a reasonably equivalent value notwithstanding a discrepancy between the value of the asset transferred and the debt secured, because the amount of the debt is the measure of the value of the interest in the asset that is transferred. See,
    e.g., Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Co. v. Holy Family Polish Nat’l Catholic Church, Carnegie, Pa.
    , 341 Pa. 390, 19 A.2d 360 (1941). If the debt is a voidable obligation under this Act, a transfer to secure it as well as the obligation would be vulnerable to attack as voidable. A transfer to satisfy or secure an antecedent debt owed an insider is also subject to avoidance under the conditions specified in Section 5(b).

         Section 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act has been thought not to recognize that an unperformed promise could constitute fair consideration. See McLaughlin,
    Application of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act
    , 46 Harv. L. Rev. 404, 414 (1933). Courts construing these provisions of the prior law nevertheless have held unperformed promises to constitute value in a variety of circumstances. See,

        If a lien given an insider for a present consideration is not perfected as against a subsequent bona fide purchaser or is so perfected after a delay following an extension of credit secured by the lien, foreclosure of the lien may result in a transfer for an antecedent debt that is voidable under Section 5(b). Subsection (b) does not apply to an action under Section 4(a)(1) to avoid a transfer or obligation because made or incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor.

        The application of avoidance statutes to debtors’ church tithing payments “substantially burdened” the free exercise of their religious beliefs and, although the avoidance statutes may be justified by a “compelling governmental interest,” they were not the “least restrictive means” of furthering that interest; the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 USCS § 2000bb et seq.) provided a defense to Chapter 7 trustee’s action to recover tithing payments as “fraudulent transfers.” In re Hodge, 220 Bankr. 386 (Bankr.

        Subdivision (2)(h) of this section contains but one of several factors which can be considered in determining whether a transfer was made or obligation was incurred with actual intent on the part of the debtor to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor; such intent is a prerequisite for liability under this section.

    Chapter 7 trustee failed to meet his burden of proving that transfers by a debtor to his wife within the two years prior to filing his petition were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors. Thus, the transfers were not avoidable under 11 U.S.C.S. § § 548(a)(1)(A) and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t55c09s55-913" target="_self">§ 55-913</a></cite>(1)(a), even though several badges of fraud were present, including the fact that they were married at the time of the transfers, he admitted that he was insolvent at the time each transfer was made, and he did not list any of the transfers on his statement of financial affairs. On balance, while there were some traditional badges of fraud present, the court found that the debtor transferred his interests in the property to his wife in preparation for the parties’ divorce.

         Section 4(a)(1) is derived from § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which in turn was derived from the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, c. 5 (1571). Factors appropriate for consideration in determining actual intent under Section 4(a)(1) are specified in subsection (b).

         Section 4, unlike § 5, protects creditors of a debtor whose claims arise after as well as before the debtor made or incurred the challenged transfer or obligation. Similarly, there is no requirement in § 4(a)(1) that the intent referred to be directed at a creditor existing or identified at the time of transfer or incurrence. For example, promptly after the invention in Pennsylvania of the spendthrift trust, the assets and beneficial interest of which are immune from attachment by the beneficiary’s creditors, courts held that a debtor’s establishment of a spendthrift trust for the debtor’s own benefit is a voidable transfer under the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, without regard to whether the transaction is directed at an existing or identified creditor.

    § 58(2) (2003) (setting forth a substantially similar rule as a matter of trust law). Likewise, for centuries § 4(a)(1) and its predecessors have been employed to invalidate nonpossessory property interests that are thought to be potentially deceptive, without regard to whether the deception is directed at an existing or identified creditor. See,

         Section 4(a)(2) is derived from §§ 5 and 6 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act but substitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for “fair consideration.” The transferee’s good faith was an element of “fair consideration” as defined in § 3 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, and lack of fair consideration was one of the elements of a fraudulent transfer as defined in four sections of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The transferee’s good faith is irrelevant to a determination of the adequacy of the consideration under this Act, but lack of good faith may be a basis for withholding protection of a transferee or obligee under § 8.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-913-citedol14">
         Unlike the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, this Act does not prescribe different tests for voidability of a transfer that is made for the purpose of security and a transfer that is intended to be absolute. The premise of this Act is that when a transfer is for security only, the equity or value of the asset that exceeds the amount of the debt secured remains available to unsecured creditors and thus cannot be regarded as the subject of a voidable transfer merely because of the encumbrance resulting from an otherwise valid security transfer. Disproportion between the value of the asset securing the debt and the size of the debt secured does not, in the absence of circumstances indicating a purpose to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, constitute an impermissible hindrance to the enforcement of other creditors’ rights against the debtor-transferor.

         Subparagraph (i) of § 4(a)(2) is an adaptation of § 5 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act but substitutes “unreasonably small [assets] in relation to the business or transaction” for “unreasonably small capital.” The reference to “capital” in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act might be interpreted, incorrectly, to refer to the par value of stock or to the consideration received for stock issued. The special meanings of “capital” in corporation law have no relevance in the law of voidable transfers. The subparagraph focuses attention on whether the amount of all the assets retained by the debtor was inadequate,
    i.e.
    , unreasonably small, in light of the needs of the business or transaction in which the debtor was engaged or about to engage.
    Subparagraph (ii) of § 4(a)(2) is an adaptation of § 6 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which relates to a debtor that has or will have debts beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they become due (a condition that is sometimes referred to as “insolvency in the equity sense”). Subparagraph (ii) carries forward the previous Act’s language capturing a debtor that “intends” or “believes” that the debtor is or will be unable to pay the debtor’s debts as they become due, and adds to that language capturing a debtor that “reasonably should have believed” the same. The added language makes clear that subparagraph (ii) also captures a debtor that, on the basis of objective assessment, has or will have debts beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they become due, regardless of the debtor’s subjective belief.

         Subsection (b) is a nonexclusive catalogue of factors appropriate for consideration by the court in determining whether the debtor had an actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud one or more creditors. Proof of the existence of any one or more of the factors enumerated in subsection (b) may be relevant evidence as to the debtor’s actual intent but does not create a presumption that the debtor has made a voidable transfer or incurred a voidable obligation. The list of factors includes most of the so-called “badges of fraud” that have been recognized by the courts in construing and applying the Statute of 13 Elizabeth and § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Proof of the presence of certain badges in combination establishes voidability conclusively —
    i.e.
    , without regard to the actual intent of the debtor — when they concur as provided in § 4(a)(2) or in § 5. The fact that a transfer has been made to a relative or to an affiliated corporation has not been regarded as a badge of fraud sufficient to warrant avoidance when unaccompanied by any other evidence of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. The courts have uniformly recognized, however, that a transfer to a closely related person warrants close scrutiny of the other circumstances, including the nature and extent of the consideration exchanged. See 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences § 307 (Rev. ed. 1940). The second, third, fourth, and fifth factors listed are all adapted from the classic catalogue of badges of fraud provided by Lord Coke in
    
     Twyne’s Case
    
    , 3 Coke 80b, 76 Eng.Rep. 809 (Star Chamber 1601). Lord Coke also included the use of a trust and the recitation in the instrument of transfer that it “was made honestly, truly, and bona fide,” but the use of the trust is voidable only when accompanied by indicia of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and recitals of “good faith” can no longer be regarded as significant evidence of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.

         In considering the factors listed in § 4(b) a court should evaluate all the relevant circumstances involving a challenged transfer or obligation. Thus the court may appropriately take into account all indicia negativing as well as those suggesting intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, as illustrated in the following reported cases:

        Section 4(a)(1) has the meaning elaborated in the preceding paragraph, but it is of course possible that a jurisdiction in which this Act is in force might enact other legislation that modifies the results of the particular examples given to illustrate that meaning. For example, some states have enacted legislation authorizing the establishment and funding of self-settled spendthrift trusts, subject to specified conditions. In such a state, such legislation will supersede the historical interpretation referred to in the preceding paragraph, either expressly or by necessary implication, with respect to allowed transfers to such a statutorily-validated trust. See,
    e.g.
    , Del. Code. Ann. tit. 12, § 3572(a), (b) (2014). See also Comment 8. Likewise, the historical skepticism of nonpossessory property interests has been superseded as to security interests in personal property by the Uniform Commercial Code. See Comment 9.

         Whether the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor that transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor: The wrong addressed by § 4(b)(11) is collusive and abusive use of a lienor’s superior position to eliminate junior creditors while leaving equity holders in place, perhaps unaffected.

    8. The phrase “hinder, delay, or defraud” in § 4(a)(1), carried forward from the primordial Statute of 13 Elizabeth, is potentially applicable to any transaction that unacceptably contravenes norms of creditors’ rights. Section 4(a)(1) is sometimes said to require “actual fraud,” by contrast to § 4(a)(2) and § 5(a), which are said to require “constructive fraud.” That shorthand is highly misleading. Fraud is not a necessary element of a claim for relief under any of those provisions. By its terms, § 4(a)(1) applies to a transaction that “hinders” or “delays” a creditor, even if it does not “defraud” the creditor. See,
    
     e.g., Shapiro v. Wilgus
    
    , 287 U.S. 348, 354 (1932);
    
     Means v. Dowd
    
    , 128 U.S. 273, 288-89 (1888);
    
     Consove v. Cohen (In re Roco Corp.)
    
    , 701 F.2d 978, 984 (1st Cir. 1983);
    
     Empire Lighting Fixture Co. v. Practical Lighting Fixture Co.
    
    , 20 F.2d 295, 297 (2d Cir. 1927);
    
     Lippe v. Bairnco Corp.
    
    , 249 F. Supp. 2d 357, 374 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). “Hinder, delay, or defraud” is best considered to be a single term of art describing a transaction that unacceptably contravenes norms of creditors’ rights. Such a transaction need not bear any resemblance to common-law fraud. Thus, the Supreme Court held a given transfer voidable because made with intent to “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors, but emphasized: “We have no thought in so holding to impute to [the debtor] a willingness to participate in conduct known to be fraudulent. . . . [He] acted in the genuine belief that what [he] planned was fair and lawful. Genuine the belief was, but mistaken it was also. Conduct and purpose have a quality imprinted on them by the law.”

       <p>
        Diminution of the assets available to the debtor’s creditors is not necessarily required to “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors. For example, the age-old legal skepticism of nonpossessory property interests, which stems from their potential for deception, has often resulted in their avoidance under § 4(a)(1) or its predecessors. See Comments 2 and 7(b);
    cf.
    Comment 9. A transaction may “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors although it neither reduces the assets available to the debtor’s creditors nor involves any potential deception. See,
        e.g., Shapiro v. Wilgus
        , 287 U.S. 348 (1932) (holding voidable a solvent individual debtor’s conveyance of his assets to a wholly-owned corporation for the purpose of instituting a receivership proceeding not available to an individual).
       </p>
       <p>
        A transaction that does not place an asset entirely beyond the reach of creditors may nevertheless “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors if it makes the asset more difficult for creditors to reach. Simple exchange by a debtor of an asset for a less liquid asset, or disposition of liquid assets while retaining illiquid assets, may be voidable for that reason. See,
    e.g., Empire Lighting Fixture Co. v. Practical Lighting Fixture Co.
    , 20 F.2d 295, 297 (2d Cir. 1927) (L. Hand, J.) (credit sale by a corporation to an affiliate of its plant, leaving the seller solvent with ample accounts receivable, held voidable because made with intent to hinder creditors of the seller, due to the comparative difficulty of creditors realizing on accounts receivable under then-current collection practice). Overcollateralization of a debt that is made with intent to hinder the debtor’s creditors, by rendering the debtor’s equity in the collateral more difficult for creditors to reach, is similarly voidable. See Comment 4. Likewise, it is voidable for a debtor intentionally to hinder creditors by transferring assets to a wholly-owned corporation or other organization, as may be the case if the equity interest in the organization is more difficult to realize upon than the assets (either because the equity interest is less liquid, or because the applicable procedural rules are more demanding). See,
        e.g., Addison v. Tessier
        , 335 P.2d 554, 557 (N.M. 1959);
        <i>
         First Nat’l Bank. v. F. C. Trebein Co.
        </i>
        , 52 N.E. 834, 837-38 (Ohio 1898); Anno., 85 A.L.R. 133 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the same principle, § 4(a)(1) would render voidable an attempt by the owners of a corporation to convert it to a different legal form (
    e.g.
    , limited liability company or partnership) with intent to hinder the owners’ creditors, as may be the case if an owner’s interest in the alternative organization would be subject only to a charging order, and not to execution (which would typically be available against stock in a corporation). See,
        e.g., Firmani v. Firmani
        , 752 A.2d 854, 857 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2000);
        <i>
         cf. Interpool Ltd. v. Patterson
        </i>
        , 890 F. Supp. 259, 266-68 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (similar, but relying on a “good faith” requirement of the former Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act rather than that act’s equivalent of § 4(a)(1)). If such a conversion is done with intent to hinder creditors, it contravenes § 4(a)(1) regardless of whether it is effected by conveyance of the corporation’s assets to a new entity or by conversion of the corporation to the alternative form. In both cases the owner begins with the stock of the corporation and ends with an ownership interest in the alternative organization, a property right with different attributes. Either is a “transfer” under the designedly sweeping language of § 1(16), which encompasses “every mode . . . of . . . parting with an asset or an interest in an asset.”
        <i>
         Cf., e.g., United States v. Sims (In re Feiler)
        </i>
        , 218 F.3d 948 (9th Cir. 2000) (debtor’s irrevocable election under the Internal Revenue Code to waive carryback of net operating losses is a “transfer” under the substantially similar definition in the Bankruptcy Code);

       </p>
       <p>
        In § 4(a)(1), the phrase “hinder, delay, or defraud,” like the word “intent,” is a term of art whose words do not have their dictionary meanings. For example, every grant of a security interest “hinders” the debtor’s unsecured creditors in the dictionary sense of that word. Yet it would be absurd to suggest that every grant of a security interest contravenes § 4(a)(1). The line between permissible and impermissible grants cannot coherently be drawn by reference to the debtor’s subjective mental state, for a rational person knows the natural consequences of his actions, and that includes the adverse consequences to unsecured creditors of any grant of a security interest. See,
    e.g., Dean v. Davis
    , 242 U.S. 438, 444 (1917) (equating an act whose “obviously necessary effect” is to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors with an act intended to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors);
        United States v. Tabor Court Realty Corp.
        , 803 F.3d 1288, 1305 (3rd Cir. 1986) (holding that the trial court’s finding of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors properly followed from its finding that the debtor could have foreseen the effect of its act on its creditors, because “a party is deemed to have intended the natural consequences of his acts”);
        <i>
         In re Sentinel Management Group Inc.
        </i>
        , 728 F.3d 660, 667 (7th Cir. 2013). Whether a transaction is captured by § 4(a)(1) ultimately depends upon whether the transaction unacceptably contravenes norms of creditors’ rights, given the devices legislators and courts have allowed debtors that may interfere with those rights. Section 4(a)(1) is the regulatory tool of last resort that restrains debtor ingenuity to decent limits.

        Thus, for example, suppose that entrepreneurs organize a business as a limited liability company, contributing assets to capitalize it, in the ordinary situation in which none of the owners has particular reason to anticipate personal liability or financial distress and no other unusual facts are present. Assume that the LLC statute has the creditor-thwarting feature of precluding execution upon equity interests in the LLC and providing only for charging orders against such interests. Notwithstanding that feature, the owners’ transfers of assets to capitalize the LLC is not voidable under § 4(a)(1) as in force in the same state. The legislature in that state, having created the LLC vehicle having that feature, must have expected it to be used in such ordinary circumstances. By contrast, if owners of an existing business were to reorganize it as an LLC under such a statute when the clouds of personal liability or financial distress have gathered over some of them, and with the intention of gaining the benefit of that creditor-thwarting feature, the transfer effecting the reorganization should be voidable under § 4(a)(1), at least absent a clear indication that the legislature truly intended the LLC form, with its creditor-thwarting feature, to be available even in such circumstances.
    Because the laws of different jurisdictions differ in their tolerance of particular creditor-thwarting devices, choice of law considerations may be important in interpreting § 4(a)(1) as in force in a given jurisdiction. For example, as noted in Comment 2, the language of § 4(a)(1) historically has been interpreted to render voidable a transfer to a self-settled spendthrift trust. Suppose that jurisdiction X, in which this Act is in force, also has in force a statute permitting an individual to establish a self-settled spendthrift trust and transfer assets thereto, subject to stated conditions. If an individual Debtor whose principal residence is in X establishes such a trust and transfers assets thereto, then under § 10 of this Act the voidable transfer law of X applies to that transfer. That transfer cannot be considered voidable in itself under § 4(a)(1) as in force in X, for the legislature of X, having authorized the establishment of such trusts, must have expected them to be used. (Other facts might still render the transfer voidable under X’s enactment of § 4(a)(1).) By contrast, if Debtor’s principal residence is in jurisdiction Y, which also has enacted this Act but has no legislation validating such trusts, and if Debtor establishes such a trust under the law of X and transfers assets to it, then the result would be different. Under § 10 of this Act, the voidable transfer law of Y would apply to the transfer. If Y follows the historical interpretation referred to in Comment 2, the transfer would be voidable under § 4(a)(1) as in force in Y.

        9. This Act is not an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations. See § 1, Comment 2. For example, the Uniform Commercial Code supplements or modifies the operation of this Act in numerous ways. Instances include the following:
       </p>
       <p>
        (a) U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.02.html#t02c04s2-402" target="_blank">§ 2-402</a></cite>(2) (2014) recognizes the generally prevailing rule that retention of possession of goods by a seller may be voidable, but limits the application of the rule by negating any imputation of voidability from “retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification.” (Indeed, independently of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.02.html#t02c04s2-402" target="_blank">§ 2-402</a></cite>(2), retention of possession of goods in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification should not in itself be considered to “hinder, delay, or defraud” any creditor of the merchant-seller under § 4(a)(1).)
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) Section 2A-308(1) provides a rule analogous to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.02.html#t02c04s2-402" target="_blank">§ 2-402</a></cite>(2) for situations in which a lessor retains possession of goods that are subject to a lease contract. Section 2A-308(3) provides that retention of possession of goods by the seller-lessee in a sale-leaseback transaction does not render the transaction voidable by a creditor of the seller-lessee if the buyer bought for value and in good faith.
       </p>
       <p>
        (c) This Act does not preempt statutes governing bulk transfers, including Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code in jurisdictions in which it remains in force.
       </p>
       <p>
        (d) Section 9-205 precludes treating a security interest in personal property as voidable on account of various enumerated features it may have. Among other things,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c02s9-205" target="_blank">§ 9-205 </a></cite>immunizes a security interest in tangible property from being avoided on account of the secured party not being in possession of the property, notwithstanding the historical skepticism of nonpossessory property interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Act operates independently of rules in an organic statute applicable to a business organization that limit distributions by the organization to its equity owners. Compliance with those rules does not insulate such a distribution from being voidable under this Act. It is conceivable that such an organic statute might contain a provision preempting the application of this Act to such distributions.
    Cf.
    Model Business Corporation Act § 152 (optional provision added in 1979 preempting the application of “any other statutes of this state with respect to the legality of distributions”; deleted 1984). Such a preemptive statute of course must be respected if applicable, but choice of law considerations may well render it inapplicable. See,
        e.g., Faulkner v. Kornman (In re The Heritage Organization, L.L.C.)
        , 413 B.R. 438, 462-63 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 2009) (action under the Texas enactment of this Act challenging a distribution by a Delaware limited liability company to its members; held, a provision of the Delaware LLC statute imposing a three-year statute of repose on an action under “any applicable law” to recover a distribution by a Delaware LLC did not apply, because choice of law rules directed application of the voidable transfer law of Texas).
       </p>
       <p>
        10. Subsection (c) was added in 2014. Sections 2(b), 4(c), 5(c), 8(g), and 8(h) together provide uniform rules on burdens and standards of proof relating to the operation of this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to subsection (c), proof of intent to “hinder, delay, or defraud” a creditor under § 4(a)(1) is sufficient if made by a preponderance of the evidence. That is the standard of proof ordinarily applied in civil actions. Subsection (c) thus rejects cases that have imposed an extraordinary standard, typically “clear and convincing evidence,” by analogy to the standard commonly applied to proof of common-law fraud. That analogy is misguided. By its terms, § 4(a)(1) applies to a transaction that “hinders” or “delays” a creditor even if it does not “defraud,” and a transaction to which § 4(a)(1) applies need not bear any resemblance to common-law fraud. See Comment 8. Furthermore, the extraordinary standard of proof commonly applied to common-law fraud originated in cases that were thought to involve a special danger that claims might be fabricated. In the earliest such cases, a court of equity was asked to grant relief on claims that were unenforceable at law for failure to comply with the Statute of Frauds, the Statute of Wills, or the parol evidence rule. In time, extraordinary proof also came to be required in actions seeking to set aside or alter the terms of written instruments. See
    Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston
    , 459 U.S. 375, 388-89 (1983) and sources cited therein. Those reasons for extraordinary proof do not apply to claims for relief under § 4(a)(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        For similar reasons, a procedural rule that imposes extraordinary pleading requirements on a claim of “fraud,” without further gloss, should not be applied to a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1). The elements of a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1) are very different from the elements of a claim of common-law fraud. Furthermore, the reasons for such extraordinary pleading requirements do not apply to a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1). Unlike common-law fraud, a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1) is not unusually susceptible to abusive use in a “strike suit,” nor is it apt to be of use to a plaintiff seeking to discover unknown wrongs. Likewise, a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1) is unlikely to cause significant harm to the defendant’s reputation, for the defendant is the transferee or obligee, and the elements of the claim do not require the defendant to have committed even an arguable wrong. See
    Janvey v. Alguire
    , 846 F. Supp. 2d 662, 675-77 (N.D. Tex. 2011);
        Carter-Jones Lumber Co. v. Benune
        , 725 N.E.2d 330, 331-33 (Ohio App. 1999).

        </i>
        Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Appendix, Form 21 (2010) (illustrative form of complaint for a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1) or similar law, which Rule 84 declares sufficient to comply with federal pleading rules).
       </p>
       <p>
        11. Subsection (c) allocates to the party making a claim for relief under § 4 the burden of persuasion as to the elements of the claim. Courts should not apply nonstatutory presumptions that reverse that allocation, and should be wary of nonstatutory presumptions that would dilute it. The command of § 13 — that this Act is to be applied so as to effectuate its purpose of making uniform the law among states enacting it — applies with particular cogency to nonstatutory presumptions. Given the elasticity of key terms of this Act (
    e.g.
    , “hinder, delay, or defraud”) and the potential difficulty of proving others (
        e.g.
        , the financial condition tests in § 4(a)(2) and § 5), employment of divergent nonstatutory presumptions by enacting jurisdictions may render the law nonuniform as a practical matter. It is not the purpose of subsection (c) to forbid employment of any and all nonstatutory presumptions. Indeed, in some instances a judicially-crafted presumption applied under this Act or its predecessors has won such favor as to be codified as a separate statutory creation. Examples include the bulk sales laws, the absolute priority rule applicable to reorganizations under Bankruptcy Code § 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) (2014), and the so-called “constructive fraud” provisions of § 4(a)(2) and § 5(a) of this Act itself. However, subsection (c) and § 13 mean, at the least, that a nonstatutory presumption is suspect if it would alter the statutorily-allocated burden of persuasion, would upset the policy of uniformity, or is an unwarranted carrying-forward of obsolescent principles. An example of a nonstatutory presumption that should be rejected for those reasons is a presumption that the transferee bears the burden of persuasion as to the debtor’s compliance with the financial condition tests in § 4(a)(2) and § 5, in an action under those provisions, if the transfer was for less than reasonably equivalent value (or, as another example, if the debtor was merely in debt at the time of the transfer). See

         Fidelity Bond & Mtg. Co. v. Brand
        </i>
        , 371 B.R. 708, 716-22 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (rejecting such a presumption previously applied in Pennsylvania).

         Subsection (a) is derived from § 4 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. It adheres to the limitation of the protection of that section to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer or obligation described. As pointed out in Comment 3 accompanying § 4, this Act substitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for “fair consideration.”

    i.e.
    , a transfer by an insolvent debtor for or on account of an antecedent debt — to an insider voidable when the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent. This subsection adopts for general application the rule of such cases as

    , 473 F.2d 503 (5th Cir. 1973) (security transfer of corporation’s equipment to corporate principal’s mother perfected on eve of bankruptcy of corporation held to be voidable);

         Subsection (b) does not extend as far as § 8(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and Bankruptcy Code § 548(b) (1984) in rendering voidable a transfer made by an insolvent partnership to a partner. A general partner is an insider of the partnership, but a transfer by the partnership to the partner nevertheless is not vulnerable to avoidance under § 5(b) unless the transfer is for an antecedent debt and the partner has reasonable cause to believe that the partnership is insolvent. By contrast, the cited provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and the Bankruptcy Code make any transfer by an insolvent partnership to a general partner voidable. Avoidance of the partnership transfer without reference to the partner’s state of mind and the nature of the consideration exchanged would be unduly harsh treatment of the creditors of the partner and unduly favorable to the creditors of the partnership.

         One of the uncertainties in the law governing the avoidance of transfers and obligations of the nature governed by this Act is the time at which the cause of action arises. Section 6 clarifies that point in time. For transfers of real property other than a fixture, paragraph (1)(i) fixes the time as the date of perfection against a good-faith purchaser from the transferor. For transfers of fixtures and assets constituting personalty, paragraph (1)(ii) fixes the time as the date of perfection against a judicial lien creditor not asserting rights under this Act. Perfection under paragraph (1) typically is effected by notice-filing, recordation, or delivery of unequivocal possession. See U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c03s9-310" target="_blank">§§ 9-310</a></cite>, 9-313 (2014) (security interest in personal property generally is perfected by notice-filing or delivery of possession to transferee); 4 American Law of Property §§ 17.10-17.12 (1952) (recordation of transfer or delivery of possession to grantee required for perfection against bona fide purchaser from grantor). The provision for postponing the time a transfer is made until its perfection is an adaptation of Bankruptcy Code § 548(d)(1) (1984). When no steps are taken to perfect a transfer that applicable law permits to be perfected, the transfer is deemed by paragraph (2) to be perfected immediately before the filing of an action to avoid it; without such a provision to cover that eventuality, an unperfected transfer arguably would be immune to attack. Some transfers may not be amenable to perfection as against a bona fide purchaser or judicial lien creditor. In the event that a transfer may not be perfected as provided in paragraph (1), paragraph (3) provides that the transfer occurs for the purpose of this Act when the transferor effectively parts with an interest in the asset.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-915-CASENOTESol12">
         Paragraph (4) requires the transferor to have rights in the asset transferred before the transfer is made for the purpose of this section. This provision makes clear that the purpose of this section may not be circumvented by notice-filing or recordation of a document evidencing an interest in an asset to be acquired in the future.

         Paragraph (5) had no analogue in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. It is intended to resolve uncertainty arising from
    Rubin v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
    , 661 F.2d 979, 989-91, 997 (2d Cir. 1981), insofar as that case holds that an obligation of guaranty may be deemed to be incurred when advances covered by the guaranty are made rather than when the guaranty first became effective between the parties. Compare Rosenberg,

        An obligation may be avoided under this Act if it is incurred under the circumstances specified in § 4(a) or § 5(a). The debtor may receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for an obligation incurred even though the benefit to the debtor is indirect. See

        In the face of a fraudulent conveyance, a creditor can either recover the actual property transferred, or a money judgment against the transferee for the property’s equivalent value. This is clearly an alternative right to payment beyond the equitable remedy of avoidance of the transfer and recovery of the asset. As such, prospective purchaser is considered to have a claim for purposes of Section 101(5)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 USCS § 101(5)(B)) and cannot void the transfer as against the bankruptcy estate and the trustee. TKO Properties v. Young, 214 Bankr. 905 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1997). Equitable Remedies.
       </p>
       <p>
        One who purchased property at an execution or tax sale received legal title and could bring an action to remove a cloud on the title created by a fraudulent transfer. Therefore, the district court had the equitable power to clear tax sale purchaser’s title by setting aside the tax debtors’ deeds to the family trust, which deeds were void and unenforceable against the tax sale purchaser. Haney v. Molko, 123 Idaho 132, 844 P.2d 1382 (Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once it has been established that a fraudulent transfer has occurred, subsection (2) of this section allows a creditor who already has a judgment against the debtor to levy execution on the asset transferred, if the court so orders. In addition, where the transfer in question is found to be fraudulent and thus voidable, the creditor may recover judgment against the transferee for the value of the asset transferred, subject to equitable adjustment under subsection (3) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t55c09s55-917" target="_self">§ 55-917</a></cite>, or for the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor’s claim, whichever is less.

        The relief that a defrauded creditor is entitled to, in an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance, is limited to setting aside the conveyance of the property.

         This section is derived from §§ 9 and 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Section 9 of that Act specified the remedies of creditors whose claims have matured, and § 10 enumerated the remedies available to creditors whose claims have not matured. A creditor holding an unmatured claim may be denied the right to receive payment from the proceeds of a sale on execution until the claim has matured, but the proceeds may be deposited in court or in an interest-bearing account pending the maturity of the creditor’s claim. The remedies specified in this section are not exclusive.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-916-citedol12">
         The availability of an attachment or other provisional remedy has been restricted by amendments of statutes and rules of procedure in response to
    Connecticut v. Doehr
    , 501 U.S. 1 (1991),
    
     Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp.
    
    , 395 U.S. 337 (1969), and their progeny. This judicial development and the procedural changes that followed in its wake do not preclude resort to attachment by a creditor in seeking avoidance of a transfer or obligation. See,
    
     e.g., Britton v. Howard Sav. Bank
    
    , 727 F.2d 315, 317-20 (3d Cir. 1984);
    
     Computer Sciences Corp. v. Sci-Tek Inc.
    
    , 367 A.2d 658, 661 (Del. Super. 1976);
    
     Great Lakes Carbon Corp. v. Fontana
    
    , 54 A.D.2d 548, 387 N.Y.S. 2d 115 (1st Dep’t 1976). Section 7(a)(2) continues the authorization for the use of attachment contained in § 9(b) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, or of a similar provisional remedy, when applicable law provides therefor, subject to the constraints imposed by the due process clauses of the United States and state constitutions.
    3. Subsections (a) and (b) of § 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act authorized the court, in an action on a voidable transfer or obligation, to restrain the defendant from disposing of his property, to appoint a receiver to take charge of his property, or to make any order the circumstances may require. Section 10, however, applied only to a creditor whose claim was unmatured. There is no reason to restrict the availability of these remedies to such a creditor, and the courts have not so restricted them. See,
    
     e.g., Lipskey v. Voloshen
    
    , 155 Md. 139, 143-45, 141 A. 402, 404-05 (1928) (judgment creditor granted injunction against disposition of property by transferee, but appointment of receiver denied for lack of sufficient showing of need for such relief);

    , 36 Misc. 2d 918, 922-23, 235 N.Y.S. 2d 973, 976-77, 991-92 (Sup. Ct. 1962) (injunction and appointment of receiver granted to holder of claims for fraud, breach of contract, and alimony arrearages; whether creditor’s claim was mature said to be immaterial);
    
     Oliphant v. Moore
    
    , 155 Tenn. 359, 362-63, 293 S.W. 541, 542 (1927) (tort creditor granted injunction restraining alleged tortfeasor’s disposition of property).
        </li>

       <p>
        4. As under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, a creditor is not required to obtain a judgment against the debtor-transferor or to have a matured claim in order to proceed under subsection (a). See §§ 1(3) and 1(4) ;

    , 251 N.Y. 1, 166 N.E. 783, 65 A.L.R. 244 (1929); 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences 129 (Rev. ed. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        5. The provision in subsection (b) for a creditor to levy execution on a transferred asset continues the availability of a remedy provided in § 9(b) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. See,
    e.g., Doland v. Burns Lbr. Co.
    , 156 Minn. 238, 194 N.W. 636 (1923);

        7. If a transfer or obligation is voidable under § 4 or § 5, the basic remedy provided by this Act is its avoidance under subsection (a)(1). “Avoidance” is a term of art in this Act, for it does not mean that the transfer or obligation is simply rendered void. It has long been established that a transfer avoided by a creditor under this Act or its predecessors is nevertheless valid as between the debtor and the transferee. For example, in the case of a transfer of property worth $100 by Debtor to Transferee, held voidable in a suit by Creditor-1 who is owed $80 by Debtor, “avoidance” of the transfer leaves the $20 surplus with Transferee. Debtor is not entitled to recover the surplus. Nor is Debtor’s Creditor-2 entitled to pursue the surplus by reason of Creditor-1’s action (though Creditor-2 may be entitled to bring its own avoidance action to pursue the surplus). The foregoing principle is embedded in the language of subsection (a)(1), which prescribes “avoidance” only “to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor’s claim.” Section 9(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was similarly limited. See,
    e.g., Becker v. Becker
    , 416 A.2d 156, 162 (Vt. 1980);
        De Martini v. De Martini
        , 52 N.E.2d 138, 141 (Ill. 1943);
        <i>
         Markward v. Murrah
        </i>
        , 156 S.W.2d 971, 974 (Tex. 1941);
        <i>
         Society Milion Athena, Inc. v. National Bank of Greece
        </i>
        , 22 N.E.2d 374, 377 (N.Y. 1939);
        <i>
         National Radiator Corp. v. Parad
        </i>
        , 8 N.E.2d 794, 796-97 (Mass. 1937); 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences § 114, at 225 (Rev. ed. 1940). The transferee’s mental state is irrelevant to the foregoing, but a good-faith transferee may also be afforded protection by § 8.
       </p>
       <p>
        It follows that “avoidance” of an obligation under subsection (a)(1) likewise should not mean its cancellation, but rather a remedy that recognizes the existence of the obligation and the superiority of the plaintiff creditor’s interest over the obligee’s interest. Ordinarily that should mean subordination of the obligation to the plaintiff creditor’s claim against the debtor. That would entail disgorgement by the obligee of any payments received or receivable on the obligation, to the extent necessary to satisfy the plaintiff creditor’s claim, with the obligee being subrogated to the plaintiff creditor when the latter’s claim is paid. Of course, if the obligation is unenforceable for reasons other than contravention of this Act, contravention of this Act does not render the obligation enforceable.

        In the face of a fraudulent conveyance, a creditor can either recover the actual property transferred, or a money judgment against the transferee for the property’s equivalent value. This is clearly an alternative right to payment beyond the equitable remedy of avoidance of the transfer and recovery of the asset. As such, prospective purchaser is considered to have a claim for purposes of Section 101(5)(B), 11 U.S.C.S. § 101(5)(B), of the Bankruptcy Code (11 USCS § 101(5)(B)) and cannot void the transfer as against the bankruptcy estate and the trustee.

        One who purchased property at an execution or tax sale received legal title and could bring an action to remove a cloud on the title created by a fraudulent transfer. Therefore, the district court had the equitable power to clear tax sale purchaser’s title by setting aside the tax debtors’ deeds to the family trust, which deeds were void and unenforceable against the tax sale purchaser.

        Once it has been established that a fraudulent transfer has occurred, subsection (2) of this section allows a creditor who already has a judgment against the debtor to levy execution on the asset transferred, if the court so orders. In addition, where the transfer in question is found to be fraudulent and, thus, voidable, the creditor may recover judgment against the transferee for the value of the asset transferred, subject to equitable adjustment under subsection (3) of this section, or for the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor’s claim, whichever is less.

         Subsection (a) sets forth a complete defense to an action for avoidance under § 4(a)(1). The subsection is an adaptation of the exception stated in § 9 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Pursuant to subsection (g), the person invoking this defense carries the burden of establishing good faith and the reasonable equivalence of the consideration exchanged.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-917-citedol12">
         Subsection (b) is derived from Bankruptcy Code §§ 550(a), (b) (1984). The value of the asset transferred is limited to the value of the levyable interest of the transferor, exclusive of any interest encumbered by a valid lien. See § 1(2).
    The requirement of Bankruptcy Code § 550(b)(1) (1984) that a transferee be “without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer” in order to be protected has been omitted as inappropriate. Knowledge of the facts rendering the transfer voidable would be inconsistent with the good faith that is required of a protected transferee. Knowledge of the voidability of a transfer would seem to involve a legal conclusion. Determination of the voidability of the transfer ought not to require the court to inquire into the legal sophistication of the transferee.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-917-citedol13">
         Subsection (c) has no analogue in Bankruptcy Code § 550(a), (b) (1984). The measure of the recovery of a creditor against a transferee is usually limited to the value of the asset transferred at the time of the transfer. See,
    e.g., United States v. Fernon
    , 640 F.2d 609, 611 (5th Cir. 1981);
    
     Hamilton Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Halstead
    
    , 134 N.Y. 520, 31 N.E. 900 (1892);
    
     cf. Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co.
    
    , 289 U.S. 227 (1932) (transferee’s objection to trial court’s award of highest value of asset between the date of the transfer and the date of the decree of avoidance rejected because an award measured by value as of time of the transfer plus interest from that date would have been larger). The premise of § 8(c) is that changes in value of the asset transferred that occur after the transfer should ordinarily not affect the amount of the creditor’s recovery. Circumstances may require a departure from that measure of the recovery, however, as the cases decided under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and other laws derived from the Statute of 13 Elizabeth illustrate. Thus, if the value of the asset at the time of levy and sale to enforce the judgment of the creditor has been enhanced by improvements of the asset transferred or discharge of liens on the property, a good-faith transferee should be reimbursed for the outlay for such a purpose to the extent the sale proceeds were increased thereby. See Bankruptcy Code § 550(d) (1984);
    
     Janson v. Schier
    
    , 375 A.2d 1159, 1160 (N.H. 1977); Anno., 8 A.L.R. 527 (1920). If the value of the asset at the time of the transfer has been diminished by severance and disposition of timber or minerals or fixtures, the transferee should be liable for the amount of the resulting reduction. See
    
     Damazo v. Wahby
    
    , 269 Md. 252, 257, 305 A.2d 138, 142 (1973). If the transferee has collected rents, harvested crops, or derived other income from the use or occupancy of the asset after the transfer, the liability of the transferee should be limited in any event to the net income after deduction of the expense incurred in earning the income. Anno., 60 A.L.R.2d 593 (1958). On the other hand, adjustment for the equities does not warrant an award to the creditor of consequential damages alleged to accrue from mismanagement of the asset after the transfer.
    4. Subsection (d) is an adaptation of Bankruptcy Code § 548(c) (1984). An insider that receives property or an obligation from an insolvent debtor as security for or in satisfaction of an antecedent debt of the transferor or obligor is not a good-faith transferee or obligee if the insider has reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred. If a foreclosure sale is voidable and does not qualify for the benefit of § 3(b) or § 8(e)(2) because it was not conducted in accordance with the requirements of applicable law, the buyer, if in good faith, will still be entitled to the benefit of subsection (d) to the extent of the price paid by the buyer.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        A transfer of property by the transferee of a voidable transfer might, on appropriate facts, be avoidable for reasons independent of the original voidable transfer. In such a case the subsequent transferee may be entitled to a defense under § 8(b) to an action based on the original voidable transfer, but that defense would not apply to an action based on the subsequent transfer that is independently voidable. For example, suppose that X transfers property to Y in a transfer voidable under this Act, and that Y later transfers the property to Z, who is a good-faith transferee for value. In general, C-1, a creditor of X, would have the right to a money judgment against Y pursuant to § 8(b), but C-1 could not recover under this Act from Z, who would be protected by § 8(b)(1)(ii)(A). However, it might be the case that Y’s transfer to Z is independently voidable as to Y’s creditors (including C-1, as creditor of Y by dint of its rights under this Act). Such might be the case if, for example, the value received by Y in exchange for the transfer is not reasonably equivalent and Y is in financial distress, or if Y made the transfer with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any of its creditors. In such a case creditors of Y may pursue remedies against Z with respect to that independently voidable transfer, and the defense afforded to Z by § 8(b)(1)(ii)(A) would not apply to that action. Of course choice of law must be considered in such a situation: the jurisdiction whose law governs the voidability of the original transfer from X to Y and the consequent liability of Y and subsequent transferees need not be the same as the jurisdiction whose law governs the voidability of the independently voidable transfer from Y to Z and the consequent liability of Z and subsequent transferees.

       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (e)(2) protects a transferee that acquires a debtor’s interest in an asset as a result of the enforcement by a secured party (which may but need not be the transferee) of rights pursuant to and in compliance with the provisions of Part 6 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
    Cf. Calaiaro v. Pittsburgh Nat’l Bank (In re Ewing)
    , 33 B.R. 288, 9 C.B.C.2d 526, CCH B.L.R. /P 69,460 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1983) (sale of pledged stock held subject to avoidance under § 548 of the Bankruptcy Code),
    <i>
     rev’d
    </i>
    , 36 B.R. 476 (W.D. Pa. 1984) (transfer held not voidable because deemed to have occurred more than one year before bankruptcy petition filed). The global requirement of Article 9 that the secured party enforce its rights in good faith, and the further requirement of Article 9 that certain remedies be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, provide substantial protection to the other creditors of the debtor. See U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c03s1-304" target="_blank">§§ 1-304</a></cite>, 9-607(b), 9-610(b) (2014). The exemption afforded by subsection (e)(2) does not extend to acceptance of collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligations it secures. That remedy, contemplated by U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c06s9-620" target="_blank">§§ 9-620 </a></cite>— 9-622 (2014), is sometimes referred to as “strict foreclosure.” An exemption for strict foreclosure is inappropriate because compliance with the rules of Article 9 relating to strict foreclosure may not sufficiently protect the interests of the debtor’s other creditors if the debtor does not act to protect equity the debtor may have in the asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        6. Subsection (f) provides additional defenses against the avoidance of a preferential transfer to an insider under § 5(b).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (1) is adapted from Bankruptcy Code § 547(c)(4) (1984), which permits a preferred creditor to set off the amount of new value subsequently advanced against the recovery of a voidable preference by a trustee in bankruptcy to the debtor without security. The new value may consist not only of money, goods, or services delivered on unsecured credit but also of the release of a valid lien. See,
    e.g., In re Ira Haupt & Co.
    , 424 F.2d 722, 724 (2d Cir. 1970);
        Baranow v. Gibraltor Factors Corp. (In re Hygrade Envelope Co.)
        , 393 F.2d 60, 65-67 (2d Cir.),
        <i>
         cert. denied
        </i>
        , 393 U.S. 837 (1968);
        <i>
         In re John Morrow & Co.
        </i>
        , 134 F. 686, 688 (S.D. Ohio 1901). It does not include an obligation substituted for a prior obligation. If the insider receiving the preference thereafter extends new credit to the debtor but also takes security from the debtor, the injury to the other creditors resulting from the preference remains undiminished by the new credit. On the other hand, if a lien taken to secure the new credit is itself voidable by a judicial lien creditor of the debtor, the new value received by the debtor may appropriately be treated as unsecured and applied to reduce the liability of the insider for the preferential transfer.
    Paragraph (2) is derived from Bankruptcy Code § 547(c)(2) (1984), which excepts certain payments made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs from avoidance by the trustee in bankruptcy as preferential transfers. Whether a transfer was in the “ordinary course” requires a consideration of the pattern of payments or secured transactions engaged in by the debtor and the insider prior to the transfer challenged under § 5(b). See Tait & Williams,
        <i>
         Bankruptcy Preference Laws: The Scope of Section 547(c)(2)
        </i>
        , 99 Banking L.J. 55, 63-66 (1982). The defense provided by paragraph (2) is available, irrespective of whether the debtor or the insider or both are engaged in business, but the prior conduct or practice of both the debtor and the insider-transferee are relevant.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (3) has no analogue in Bankruptcy Code § 547 (1984). It reflects a policy judgment that an insider who has previously extended credit to a debtor should not be deterred from extending further credit to the debtor in a good-faith effort to save the debtor from a forced liquidation in bankruptcy or otherwise. A similar rationale has sustained the taking of security from an insolvent debtor for an advance to enable the debtor to stave off bankruptcy and extricate itself from financial stringency.

    , 80 F.2d 505, 508-09 (8th Cir. 1935);

        , 257 F. 497, 5 A.L.R. 561 (9th Cir. 1919);

         Dean v. Davis
        </i>
        , 242 U.S. 438, 444 (1917). The amount of the present value given, the size of the antecedent debt secured, and the likelihood of success for the rehabilitative effort are relevant considerations in determining whether the transfer was in good faith.

        7. Subsections (g) and (h) were added in 2014. Sections 2(b), 4(c), 5(c), 8(g), and 8(h) together provide uniform rules on burdens and standards of proof relating to the operation of this Act. The principles stated in Comment 11 to § 4 apply to subsections (g) and (h).
       </p>
       <p>
        8. The provisions of § 8 are integral elements of the rights created by this Act. Accordingly, they should apply if this Act is invoked in a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 544(b) (2014). That follows from the fundamental principle that property rights in bankruptcy should be the same as outside bankruptcy, unless a federal interest compels a different result. See
    Butner v. United States
    , 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979). Section 8(b) limits damages under this Act to the amount of the plaintiff creditor’s claim, and that limitation is overridden in bankruptcy by the rule of
        Moore v. Bay
        , 284 U.S. 4 (1931), which Congress unmistakably maintained when it enacted the Bankruptcy Code. In the absence of a clear override by the Bankruptcy Code or other federal law, however, other aspects of § 8 should apply if this Act is invoked in bankruptcy. See,
        <i>
         e.g., Decker v. Tramiel (In re JTS Corp.)
        </i>
        , 617 F.3d 1102, 1110-16 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that § 8(d) applies to a claim for relief brought under this Act in a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 544(b)).

         This section had no analogue in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Its purpose is to make clear that lapse of the statutory periods prescribed by the section bars the right and not merely the remedy. The section rejects the rule applied in
    United States v. Gleneagles Inv. Co.
    , 565 F. Supp. 556, 583 (M.D. Pa. 1983) (state statute of limitations held not to apply to action by United States based on Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act). Another consequence of barring the right and not merely the remedy is that, under
    
     Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws
    
    § 143 (1971), if an action is brought in jurisdiction A and the action is determined to be governed by this Act as enacted in jurisdiction B, the action cannot be maintained if it is time-barred in jurisdiction B. The 1988 revision of §§ 142 and 143 of the
    
     Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws
    
    , which eliminated the right/remedy distinction, should not be applied to this Act. Because a voidable transfer or obligation may injure all of a debtor’s many creditors, there is need for a uniform and predictable cutoff time.

        <li id="t55c09s55-918-citedol12">
         Statutes of limitations applicable to the avoidance of transfers and obligations vary widely from state to state and are frequently subject to uncertainties in their application. See Hesson,
    The Statute of Limitations in Actions to Set Aside Fraudulent Conveyances and in Actions Against Directors by Creditors of Corporations
    , 32 Cornell L.Q. 222 (1946); Annos., 76 A.L.R. 864 (1932), 128 A.L.R. 1289 (1940), 133 A.L.R. 1311 (1941), 14 A.L.R.2d 598 (1950), and 100 A.L.R.2d 1094 (1965). Together with § 6, this section should mitigate the uncertainty and diversity that have characterized the decisions applying statutes of limitations to actions to avoid transfers and obligations. The periods prescribed apply, whether the action under this Act is brought by a creditor or by a purchaser at a sale on execution levied pursuant to § 7(b) and whether the action is brought against the original transferee or subsequent transferee. The prescription of statutory periods of limitation does not preclude the barring of an avoidance action for laches. See § 12 and the accompanying Comment.
        </li>
        <li id="t55c09s55-918-citedol13">
         Subsection (a) provides that the four-year period ordinarily applicable to a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1) is extended to “one year after the transfer or obligation was or could reasonably have been discovered by the claimant.” Antecedents to that “discovery rule” have long existed in common law and in other statutes, and courts may take different approaches to filling out the meaning of subsection (a) by reference to such precedents. Thus, subsection (a) literally starts the one-year period when the transfer was or could reasonably have been discovered by the claimant, but cases applying subsection (a) have held that the period starts only when the transfer and its wrongful nature were or could reasonably have been discovered. See,
    e.g., Freitag v. McGhie
    , 947 P.2d 1186 (Wash. 1997);
    
     State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Cordua
    
    , 834 F. Supp. 2d 301, 306-08 (E.D. Pa. 2011). A recurring situation to which that distinction may be relevant is Spouse X’s transfer of assets beyond the reach of creditors, made in anticipation of divorcing Spouse Y after the four-year period has elapsed and made for the purpose of thwarting Spouse Y’s economic interests in the divorce. Spouse Y may well know of the transfer long before Spouse Y learns its wrongful purpose. Of course, even if the period specified in subsection (a) is held to have lapsed in a given case, law other than this Act might allow the transferred assets to be considered in making a division of assets in the ensuing divorce case.

         Section 10, added in 2014, is a simple and predictable choice of law rule applicable to claims for relief of the nature governed by the Act. It provides that a claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under the Act is governed by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is “located” at the time the challenged transfer is made or the challenged obligation is incurred. “Local” law means the substantive law of the referenced jurisdiction, and not its choice of law rules. Section 6 determines the time at which a transfer is made or obligation is incurred for purposes of the Act, including this section. Section 10 applies equally to a candidate jurisdiction that is a sister state and to a candidate jurisdiction that is a foreign nation.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Basing choice of law on the location of the debtor is analogous to the rule set forth in U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c03s9-301" target="_blank">§ 9-301 </a></cite>(2014), which provides that the priority of a security interest in intangible property is generally governed by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located. The analogy is apt, because the substantive rules of this Act are a species of priority rule, in that they determine the circumstances in which a debtor’s creditors, rather than the debtor’s transferee, have superior rights in property transferred by the debtor. In keeping with that analogy, the definition of the debtor’s “location” in subsection (a) is identical to the baseline definition of that term in U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c03s9-307" target="_blank">§ 9-307</a></cite>(b) (2014). Subsection (a) does not include any of the exceptions to the baseline definition that are set forth in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, such as U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c03s9-307" target="_blank">§ 9-307</a></cite>(e) (2014) (providing that the location of a domestic corporation or other “registered organization” is its jurisdiction of organization), and U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c03s9-307" target="_blank">§ 9-307</a></cite>(c) (2014) (providing in effect that if the baseline definition would locate a debtor in a jurisdiction that lacks an Article 9-style filing system, then the debtor is instead located in the District of Columbia). Those exceptions are not included in subsection (a) because their primary purpose relates to the operation of Article 9’s perfection rules, which have no analogue in this Act.
    2. The choice of law rule set forth in § 10(b) applies to any claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under this Act — in other words, any claim for relief sufficiently similar to a claim for relief under this Act as to warrant the application of this Act’s choice of law rule. “This Act” of course refers to the enactment of this Act that is in force in the jurisdiction whose enactment of § 10(b) is being applied. Section 10(b) could not properly have been written to apply merely to “a claim for relief under this Act,” for such a formulation would presuppose the applicability of the substantive provisions of this Act as in force in that jurisdiction. If a question should arise as to whether a given claim for relief is sufficiently similar to a claim for relief under this Act that § 10(b) should apply to it, the answer is left to judicial determination.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. As used in subsection (a), the terms “principal residence,” “place of business,” and “chief executive office” are to be evaluated on the basis of authentic and sustained activity, not on the basis of manipulations employed to establish a location artificially (
    e.g.
    , by such means as establishing a notional “chief executive office” by use of straw-man officers or directors in a jurisdiction in which creditors’ rights are substantially debased, or establishing a notional “principal residence” for a short term in such a jurisdiction for the purpose of making an asset transfer while there). Notwithstanding the adaptation of subsection (a) from U.C.C.<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.09.html#t09c03s9-307" target="_blank">§ 9-307</a></cite>(b) (2014), the foregoing terms need not necessarily have the same meanings in both statutes. Debtors are likely to have greater incentive and ability to employ “asset tourism” for the purpose of seeking to evade the substantive rules of this Act than for the purpose of seeking to manipulate the perfection and priority rules of secured transactions law. Interpretation and application of this Act should so recognize.
       </p>
       <p>
        4. “Location” under this Act is completely independent from the concept of “center of main interests” (“COMI”), as that term is used in Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 15, which applies to transnational insolvency proceedings, requires United States courts to defer in various ways to a foreign proceeding in the jurisdiction of the debtor’s COMI. Those consequences are quite different from the consequences of “location” under this Act. Furthermore, if the debtor is an organization, the debtor’s jurisdiction of organization has no bearing on the debtor’s “location” under subsection (a), by contrast to the presumption in Bankruptcy Code § 1516(c) (2014) that the jurisdiction in which the debtor has its registered office (i.e., its jurisdiction of organization) is its COMI.
       </p>
       <p>
        5. Section 10(b) determines the governing law only for a claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under this Act. Furthermore, this Act, like the earlier Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, has never purported to be an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations. See Comment 2 to § 15. Accordingly, the choice of law rule set forth in this § 10 is by no means applicable to all assertions that a transfer was made or an obligation incurred in contravention of law.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, suppose that the principal residence of Spouse X is State A and the principal residence of Spouse Y is State B. Spouse Y, anticipating a future divorce, transfers assets to Transferee for the purpose of thwarting X’s economic interests in the divorce. Later a divorce action between X and Y is properly brought in the courts of State A, which has enacted this Act. Law other than this Act (presumably the family law of State A) will govern such matters as the classification of the transferred property as marital or separate and the remedies available against Y for wrongful dissipation of assets, such as awarding a larger share of marital property to X or imposing a lien on the separate property of Y. The choice of law rule set forth in § 10 does not apply to those matters, for they do not involve a claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under this Act. However, if Transferee is subject to personal jurisdiction in State A and X brings an action in State A against Transferee seeking avoidance of the transfer, or a money judgment against Transferee in lieu of avoidance, on the ground that the transfer had been made by Y with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud X, the choice of law rule set forth in § 10 would apply to that action, and as a result that action would be governed by the voidable transfer law of State B.

        This section is derived from § 11 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and Uniform Commercial Code<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c01s1-103" target="_blank">§ 1-103 </a></cite>(1984) (later<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c01s1-103" target="_blank">§ 1-103</a></cite>(b) (2014)). The section adds a reference to “laches” in recognition of the particular appropriateness of the application of this equitable doctrine to an untimely action to avoid a transfer under this Act. See
    Louis Dreyfus Corp. v. Butler
    , 496 F.2d 806, 808 (6th Cir. 1974) (action to avoid transfers to debtor’s wife when debtor was engaged in speculative business held to be barred by laches or applicable statutes of limitations);

       <ol>
        <li id="t55c09s55-922-STATUTORYNOTESol11">
         The 2014 amendments change the short title of the Act from “Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act” to “Uniform Voidable Transactions Act.” The change of title is not intended to effect any change in the meaning of the Act. The retitling is not motivated by the substantive revisions made by the 2014 amendments, which are relatively minor. Rather, the word “Fraudulent” in the original title, though sanctioned by historical usage, was a misleading description of the Act as it was originally written. Fraud is not, and never has been, a necessary element of a claim for relief under the Act. The misleading intimation to the contrary in the original title of the Act led to confusion in the courts. See,
    e.g.
    , § 4, Comment 10. The misleading insistence on “fraud” in the original title also contributed to the evolution of widely-used shorthand terminology that further tends to distort understanding of the provisions of the Act. Thus, several theories of recovery under the Act that have nothing whatever to do with fraud (or with intent of any sort) came to be widely known by the oxymoronic and confusing shorthand tag “constructive fraud.” See §§ 4(a)(2), 5(a). Likewise, the primordial theory of recovery under the Act, set forth in § 4(a)(1), came to be widely known by the shorthand tag “actual fraud.” That shorthand is misleading, because that provision does not in fact require proof of fraudulent intent. See § 4, Comment 8.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        In addition, the word “Transfer” in the original title of the Act was underinclusive, because the Act applies to incurrence of obligations as well as to transfers of property.
    2. The Act, like the earlier Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, has never purported to be an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations. See Prefatory Note (1984), /P5; § 1, Comment 2, /P6; § 4, Comment 9, /P1; § 10, Comment 5. It remains the case that the Act is not the exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. The retitling of the Act should not be construed to affect references to the Act in other statutes or international instruments that use the former terminology. See,
    e.g.
    , Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, art. 30(a)(3), opened for signature Nov. 16, 2001, S. Treaty Doc. No. 108-10 (referring to “any rules of law applicable in insolvency proceedings relating to the avoidance of a transaction as a . . . transfer in fraud of creditors”).
       </p>
       <p>
        4. The 2014 amendments also make a correction to the text of the Act that is consonant with the change of the Act’s title. As originally written, the Act inconsistently used different words to denote a transfer or obligation for which the Act provides a remedy: sometimes “voidable” (see original § 2(d), §§ 8(a), (d), (e), (f)), and sometimes “fraudulent” (see original § 4(a), §§ 5(a), (b), § 9). The amendments resolve that inconsistency by using “voidable” consistently or deleting the word as unnecessary. No change in meaning is intended.
       </p>
       <p>
        5. The Act does not address the extent to which a person who facilitates the making of a transfer or the incurrence of an obligation that is voidable under the Act may be subject to liability for that reason, whether under a theory of aiding and abetting, civil conspiracy, or otherwise. The Act leaves that subject to supplementary principles of law. See § 12.
    Cf
    . § 8(b)(1)(i) (imposing liability upon,
        inter alia
        , “the person for whose benefit the transfer was made”). Other law also governs such matters as (i) the circumstances in which a lawyer who assists a debtor in making a transfer or incurring an obligation that is voidable under the Act violates rules of professional conduct applicable to lawyers, (ii) the circumstances in which communications between the debtor and the lawyer in respect of such a transfer or obligation are excepted from attorney-client privilege, and (iii) the extent to which criminal sanctions apply to a debtor, transferee, obligee, or person who facilitates the making of a transfer or the incurrence of an obligation that is voidable under the Act. Neither the retitling of the Act, nor the consistent use of “voidable” in its text per Comment 4, effects any change in the meaning of the Act, and those amendments should not be construed to affect any of the foregoing matters.

        The statutes contain no restriction on the area of the property subject to the homestead, rather, the law utilizes a value limitation in restricting the extent of the exemption and since the unimproved lot physically “surrounds” the improved lot, and the two lots have been utilized by its owner as a single parcel, it is of no consequence that the parcel is legally or physically capable of being divided and sold as two tracts.

        Debtor attempted to claim an exemption in her joint interest in a mobile home under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3)(B); Idaho law permitted the debtor’s creditors to reach her interest in the mobile home because the debtor could not use her mother’s homestead exemption to protect her own interest in the mobile home when she already claimed a homestead exemption in another home where she resided, and the debtor could not circumvent the prohibition against claiming multiple homestead exemptions under subsection (2) of this section. In re Antonie, 447 B.R. 610 (D. Idaho 2011).
    Bankruptcy debtor improperly claimed a homestead exemption in unimproved real property where, aside from filing declarations of abandonment and homestead, respectively, on her occupied home and the unimproved property, the debtor failed to show that the unimproved property was actually intended as her principal home.

        Idaho laws protect debtors’ homestead property, no matter the size or the number of legal parcels, as long as that property is contiguous and used as a whole.

        Where Chapter 7 debtors sought a homestead exemption on their home under construction, the debtors did not qualify for a homestead exemption under subsection (2), because they neither executed nor recorded a declaration of homestead as to the property and because they did not occupy the property as their residence. In re Cerchione, 398 B.R. 699 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a debtor and her husband purchased a property as a married couple and resided there as their principal residence, the property was automatically protected by a homestead exemption under this section, and a creditor’s judgment, which was recorded thereafter, did not attach as a judgment lien pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.10.html#t10c11s10-1110" target="_blank">§ 10-1110</a></cite>. However, when the debtor quitclaimed her interest to her husband and then he later quitclaimed her interest back, the judgment lien attached to her new interest at the same that she reacquired that interest. Because those acts occurred simultaneously, the debtor did not have an ownership interest, or a homestead exemption, prior to the lien affixing, and the property was subject to the judgment lien under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t55c10s55-1005" target="_self">§ 55-1005</a></cite>.

        Debtors failed to establish that they acquired a homestead exemption on real property where they did not actually reside, where they failed to formally declare an abandonment of their automatic homestead on the property where they did reside or to estimate the cash value of the nonresidence, as required by this section.

        Even if a Chapter 7 debtor who resided in an apartment in Idaho, where she worked, might otherwise have been entitled to claim a homestead exemption as to a home that she owned in Colorado, her failure to execute and file a declaration of homestead pursuant to this section foreclosed the successful assertion of any such claim in a bankruptcy court. In re Capps, 438 B.R. 668 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2010).
    Debtors’ vested remainder interest, coupled with their proper filing and recording of a declaration of abandonment of their present residence and a declaration of homestead as to the home in which they had a remainder interest, was adequate to establish a valid homestead exemption under this section. There is no requirement that the debtors reside in the property in order to claim the exemption. In re Thomason, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 886 (Bankr. D. Idaho Feb. 19, 2013).

        Although debtor never established an automatic homestead on his property, he had an ownership interest in the property when he filed his declaration that he intended to occupy the property as a homestead, raising a presumption of a homestead exemption.

        A Chapter 7 debtor who filed a declaration of homestead, pursuant to this section, in unimproved land that he owned in Idaho Falls was not precluded from claiming the land as his homestead just because he owned improved property in Roberts at the time he that filed his declaration. However, the court sustained the trustee’s objection to the debtor’s homestead exemption claim, where the declaration of homestead that the debtor filed did not state that he intended to reside on the Idaho Falls property.

        Debtors were not entitled to the validation of their homestead exemption by default; their failure to comply with the requirement of abandoning their original homestead was fatal to their exemption claim In re Gardner, 417 B.R. 616 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        If an owner with a valid exemption by declaration later wishes to take advantage of the “automatic” homestead in a newly established principal residence, he must first record a declaration of abandonment as to his homestead by declaration. Otherwise, lest the public be misled, the homestead by declaration continues in effect, and the second exemption is not established. In re Davis, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 197 (Bankr. D. Idaho Jan. 17, 2012).

       <p>
        When debtors recorded their homestead declaration in 2000 for property that they owned in Shoup, they owned and occupied property in Monteview. While they recorded the homestead declaration, they did not record a declaration of abandonment for the Monteview property. Thus, they did not meet the specific technical requirements of this section and did not establish an exemption by declaration in the Shoup Property. In re Davis, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 197 (Bankr. D.

        Since a life estate constitutes an adequate ownership interest to establish a homestead under this section, then a fee simple remainder interest, already granted and awaiting only the eventual passing of the life tenant, is also sufficient. There is no requirement that the debtors currently reside in the property for which they are requesting the homestead exemption. In re Thomason, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 886 (Bankr. D. Idaho Feb. 19, 2013).
    Bankruptcy debtors were entitled to an exemption in their homestead, even though one of two dwellings on the homestead property was rented by tenants, since there was no restriction on what sort of additional buildings or improvements were permitted on the homestead.

       <p>
        There are several ways in which an established homestead exemption may terminate. First, a property owner may file a declaration of abandonment of homestead with the county recorder where a homestead is located. Second, a presumption of abandonment arises if a property owner vacates a homestead for a continuous period of at least six months, and does not record a declaration of nonabandonment. Third, where a debtor claims a homestead exemption in property in which he is residing, Idaho’s statutes limit the exemption to his principal residence. In re Davis, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 197 (Bankr. D.

        Where creditor recorded a judgment in the county recorder’s office in July 2010, a judgment lien in favor of the creditor would attach to all of debtor’s after-acquired property in that county until the judgment is satisfied or lapses. When debtor purchased a home in the county in September 2010, creditor’s lien affixed to the property immediately. Thus, although debtor filed a homestead declaration two days later, the property was not exempt from execution because of the priority of the judgment lien. In re Bailey, 2011 Bankr.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A homestead is presumed abandoned if the owner vacates the property for a continuous period of at least six (6) months. However, if an owner is going to be absent from the homestead for more than six (6) months but does not intend to abandon the homestead, and has no other principal residence, the owner may execute and acknowledge, in the same manner as a grant of real property is acknowledged, a declaration of nonabandonment of homestead and file the declaration for record in the office of the recorder of the county in which the property is situated. The declaration of nonabandonment of homestead must contain:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t55c10s55-1006ol11">
       A statement that the owner claims the property as a homestead, that the owner intends to occupy the property in the future, and that the owner claims no other property as a homestead;

        Because the debtor moved from Idaho to Utah around October 1, 2009, and filed a bankruptcy petition on December 22, 2009, the statutory presumption of abandonment under this section did not apply. However, an absence of any length, presuming the debtor intended to make another residence his principal residence and to abandon a previous one, could have constituted an abandonment. In re Forshee, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 3044 (Bankr. D. Idaho Sept. 16, 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Chapter 7 debtor who resided in an apartment in Idaho, where she worked, visiting her “permanent residence” in Colorado every six months, was not entitled to exempt her interest in the Colorado property as her homestead given the presumption, albeit rebuttable, created by this section, that absence from a residence for six months or more constituted “abandonment” of such a purported homestead. In re Capps, 438 B.R. 668 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2010).
    The factors a court will consider when determining whether a homestead has been abandoned include: 1) whether there is evidence of the debtor’s actual intent to abandon the homestead; 2) whether the debtor asserted the homestead exemption in the bankruptcy schedules, suggesting an intent not to abandon; and 3) whether the debtor’s current residence is in the nature of a short-term rental. In re Marcovitz, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 4132 (Bankr. D. Idaho Oct. 25, 2011).

       <p>
        Where prior to filing their bankruptcy petition, debtors did not live in the residence for a continuous period of over six months and their declaration of nonabandonment was filed over six months after they ceased to reside in the residence, where they did not file their declaration until after they filed their bankruptcy petition, and at the time they filed their declaration, the residence was the property of the estate and not property of the debtors, and where it was thus questionable whether they had standing to file the declaration and they did not file their declaration until after the creditor filed its objection to their claim of homestead, this section applied and the debtors were presumed to have abandoned the homestead.

        Nonabandonment declaration filed by debtor was not only unnecessary, it had no effect on the existence or nonexistence of a homestead exemption in the property, because the evidence did not establish that debtor, at any time, created a homestead in the property by virtue of his occupation of it as a principal residence.

       <p>
        The statutes contain no restriction on the area of the property subject to the homestead, rather, the law utilizes a value limitation in restricting the extent of the exemption and since the unimproved lot physically “surrounds” the improved lot, and the two lots have been utilized by its owner as a single parcel, it is of no consequence that the parcel is legally or physically capable of being divided and sold as two tracts.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no indication that creditors relied upon the presumption of nonabandonment of a homestead in allowing debtors to become indebted to them, where debtors’ declaration of nonabandonment failed and debtors were deemed to have abandoned the homestead, where evidence showed that the debtors executed a contract to sell the residence and, pursuant to the contract, debtors vacated the property and the buyers moved in prior to closing but the sale fell through, where debtors never established another homestead, and where after the sale fell through, the buyers refused to vacate the premises, whereupon debtors immediately took steps to have the buyers evicted and debtors subsequently reoccupied the residence, such evidence was sufficient to show debtors did not intend to abandon the residence as a homestead to rebut the presumption of abandonment of a homestead. In re Cavanaugh, 175 Bankr. 369 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where testimony reflected that the debtors did not give any thought one way or the other as to abandonment of the homestead property when hope of employment elsewhere led them to move to a temporary, rented, residence, it was sufficient to rebut the presumption of abandonment.

However, she rebutted the presumption of abandonment, as there was no indication that she actually intended to abandon her homestead exemption, she amended her bankruptcy schedules to assert the homestead exemption, and she indicated that she intended to move back into the house until it was sold.

        The statute clearly states that the terms “attachment,” “execution” and “forced sale” involve judicial proceedings, and by no stretch of its plain language can it be deemed to include a voluntary, contractual right of setoff. Lares v. West One Bank, 188 F.3d 1166 (9th Cir. 1999).

        Proceeds of Voluntary Sale.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although this section exempts the proceeds of the voluntary sale of a homestead for one year from receipt, where at time bankruptcy case was reopened and the adversary proceeding to avoid judicial liens commenced, the proceeds from the sale of mobile home had already been disbursed to the lien creditors, and the liens extinguished, debtors had no interest in the proceeds at that time and, therefore, had no right to avoid any liens. In re Kudrna, 173 Bankr. 934 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy court found that a debtor who lived two to three days a week in a house he owned, and the rest of the time at his fianc/Aee’s house, did not intend to abandon the house he owned until he sold it, and it allowed the debtor to claim $79,916 he received from the sale of the house as exempt property derived from the sale of a homestead. In re Younger, 373 B.R. 111 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2007).
    Chapter 7 debtors were entitled to a $100,000 homestead exemption on their home under construction under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t55c10s55-1003" target="_self">§ 55-1003 </a></cite>and this section, because, within one year of receipt, they used identifiable funds from the sale of their old homestead to help finance construction of the new homestead. In re Cerchione, 398 B.R. 699 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appliances purchased by Chapter 7 debtors with exempt proceeds from the sale of their old homestead for installation in their new homestead were not exempt under this section, because the definition of homestead in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t55c10s55-1001" target="_self">§ 55-1001</a></cite>(2) does not include fixtures or appliances. In re Cerchione, 398 B.R. 699 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section did not provide for equitable tolling of the one-year period for reinvesting proceeds from a sale of a homestead, it was applied where a debtor did not have unrestricted access to the proceeds, first because of a divorce action, then because of the automatic stay, and then because a trustee’s objection to the debtor’s claim of exemption in the sale proceeds was filed. In re Marriott, 427 B.R. 887 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        While debtor had an initially valid claim to an exemption under this statute for payments she received in divorce proceedings, for her interest in a homestead, because she commingled and spent some of the funds, the debtor did not handle and treat the funds in such a manner as to preserve a valid claim of the exemption. In re Kierig, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 2251 (Bankr. D. Idaho Feb. 10, 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceeds from the voluntary sale of a home may only be claimed exempt if they are held for the purpose of acquiring a new homestead. If the proceeds are to be used for any other purpose, they may not be validly claimed as exempt. In re Kierig, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 2251 (Bankr. D. Idaho Feb. 10, 2000).

       <p>
        The requirements of this act shall apply to condominiums only (a) if there shall be recorded in the county in which such condominiums are located or to be located a declaration, as provided in this act, together with a plat or plats, and (b) if said documents, or either of them, contain an expression of intent to create a project which is subject to the provisions of this act, and (c) if at least one (1) of such documents contains:
       </p>
       <p>
        The declaration and the plat or plats may, prior to the first sale of a condominium, be amended or revoked by a subsequently recorded instrument executed and acknowledged by the then record owner and the then holder of any recorded security interest in such property. Until such recordation of such a revocation, the provisions of this act shall continue to apply to such property. The term “record owner” as used in this section means the owner or owners of the property; or, in the case of property held under a recorded lease, the lessee; or, in the case of property held under a recorded sublease of such a lease, the sublessee; or, in the case of property held under a recorded assignment of such a lease or such a sublease, the assignee, but does not include holders or owners of unrecorded interests, or mineral interests, of easements or of rights of way.

       <p>
        Reliance by owners and building associations on the condominium property act for the proposition that they were entitled to fee simple ownership of certain disputed properties was misplaced because the covenants, conditions, and restrictions for the development recorded by the original owner and developer did not reference the act; additionally, no plat was recorded, so any development could not have qualified under this section, which requires recording of a declaration and a plat.

       <p>
        The Idaho law governing development and sales of condominiums does not prohibit or restrict the developer from retaining control over the managing body of condominium owners by reason of the developer’s ownership of built but unsold units; the Idaho act is simply silent on the subject.

        The trial court’s decision refusing to set aside a default judgment was not clearly erroneous where defendant in a real property dispute was not a lienholder of record and, thus, defendant’s signature was not required upon the amended master condominium declarations.

Such percentage shall be fixed either by taking as a basis the value of each unit in relation to the value of the property as a whole or by taking as a basis the square footage of the interior floor area of each unit in relation to the square footage of the interior floor area of all the units as a whole.

        Except when a domestic corporation has been formed and designated in the declaration to serve as the management body to administer the project, at the time the declaration is recorded one (1) or more persons shall be designated to receive service of process in any action relating to the common areas and facilities. Such designation shall be filed with the county auditor in the county in which the project is located together with an acknowledgment in writing of acceptance of such designation by the person so designated. The person so designated shall be a resident of the state of Idaho, and service upon such person shall be the exclusive method of service in any action relating to the common areas and facilities. Upon termination of such person’s capacity or authority to receive service, a new designation shall be made by the management body of the project, and such designation shall be filed with the county auditor in the county in which the project is located together with an acknowledgment in writing of acceptance of such designation by the person so designated. Upon failure to so designate a person to receive service of process and to file such designation and acceptance of such designation, service may be made upon the county auditor with like effect as though said service were made upon a person designated, and it shall be the duty of the county auditor to forward a copy of such summons served on him by registered mail to the management body of the project at the address or location last known, but no failure on the part of the county auditor to mail such copy of summons shall affect the validity of the service thereof. When a corporate organization is formed and designated as the management body, service of process on the corporation shall be as permitted by law, and the Idaho rules of civil procedure.

      Each condominium owner’s liability for claims, judgments or awards arising out of or in connection with the ownership, use, operation or management of the common areas, is limited to a proportionate sum which equals the amount of any such claim, judgment or award multiplied by the percentage interest in the common areas allocated to such ownership by the declaration as provided in section 55-1505(1)(c). In any suit to establish liability for claims, judgments or awards arising out of or in connection with the ownership, use, operation or management of the common areas there shall be introduced no evidence as to the percentage interest in the common area of any condominium owner until and unless such fact becomes material and liability is fixed by judgment or agreed upon in writing signed by all affected parties to the litigation and filed with the court. Any condominium owner may compromise or settle his portion of any such claim without prejudice to the remaining balance thereof and without the same constituting evidence or an admission for or against any such claimant.

      The provisions of this section shall not alter or affect the respective rights and obligations of condominium owners to or between one another to the extent that one or more may have any legal right arising from contract, statute, or the common law to be wholly or partially indemnified by one or more other persons who are likewise owners of condominiums within the same said project.

        An assessment upon any condominium made in accordance with the declaration, any recorded by-laws, or any duly promulgated project regulation, shall be a debt of the owner thereof at the time the assessment is made. The amount of any such assessment, together with those other charges thereon, such as interest, costs (including attorney’s fees), and penalties, which may be provided for in the declaration, shall be and become a lien upon the condominium assessed when the management body causes to be recorded with the county recorder of the county in which such condominium is located a notice of assessment, which shall state the amount of such assessment and such other charges thereon as may be authorized by the declaration, a description of the condominium against which the same has been assessed, and the name of the record owner thereof. Such notice shall be signed by an authorized representative of the management body or as otherwise provided in the declaration. Upon payment of said assessment and charges in connection with which such notice has been so recorded, or other satisfaction thereof, the management body shall cause to be recorded a further notice stating the satisfaction and the release of the lien thereof.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such lien shall be prior to all other liens filed or recorded subsequent to the recordation of said notice of assessment except that the declaration may provide for the subordination thereof to other liens either generally or specifically described and except further that labor or materialmen’s liens arising under the law of Idaho and timely and duly filed shall have priority if the date fixed by statute for such lien to arise is prior to recording as provided in this section. Unless sooner satisfied and released or the enforcement thereof initiated as hereafter provided such lien shall expire and be of no further force or effect one (1) year from the date of recordation of said notice of assessment; provided, however, that said one-year period may be extended by the management body for not to exceed one (1) additional year by recording a written extension thereof.

       <p>
        Such lien may be enforced by sale by the management body, its attorney or other person authorized to make the sale, after failure of the owner to pay such an assessment in accordance with its terms, such sale to be conducted in the manner permitted by law for the exercise of powers of sale in deeds of trust or any other manner permitted by law. Unless otherwise provided in the declaration the management body shall have the power to purchase the condominium at foreclosure sale and to hold, lease, encumber and convey the same.

        Bureau of land management publications are not statutes and they may not be utilized to establish burdens of proof in real property disputes involving lost or obliterated corners. State ex rel. Evans v. Barnett, 116 Idaho 429, 776 P.2d 438 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute concerning the location of the section line forming the legal boundary between the land owned by the state and the adjoining property owners, the state had the initial burden of coming forward with evidence showing the original survey point of the corner could not be determined and its location could be restored only by reference to adjacent corners. If this burden is met, the adjoining property owners, in order to sustain their contention that the corner is obliterated, must come forward with evidence showing although there are no remaining traces of the original monument, either the location has been perpetuated or the point may be recovered beyond reasonable doubt by other acceptable evidence. State ex rel. Evans v. Barnett, 114 Idaho 355, 757 P.2d 218 (Ct. App. 1988).

       <p>
        Where neither expert witness believed beyond a reasonable doubt that the place marked by a timber cruiser in or near the fence was an obliterated corner, the state met its burden of proving the corner was lost and was properly restored through proportional measurements derived from the original surveyor’s field notes.

      It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and perpetuate public land survey corners and information concerning the location of such corners by requiring the systematic establishment of monuments and filing of information concerning the marking of the location of such public land survey corners and to allow the systematic location of other property corners, thereby providing for property security and a coherent system of property location and identification; and thereby eliminating the repeated necessity for reestablishment and relocations of such corners once they are established and located.

     <p>
      A professional land surveyor shall complete, sign, and file with the county clerk and recorder of the county where the corner is situated a written record of the establishment, reestablishment, or rehabilitation of a corner monument and its accessories. This record shall be known as a “corner record” and such a filing shall be made for every public land survey corner, center one-quarter (1/4) corner, and accessory to such corner which is established, reestablished, monumented, remonumented, rehabilitated, perpetuated or used as control in any survey. The survey information shall be filed within ninety (90) days after the survey is completed, unless the corner and its accessories are substantially as described in an existing corner record filed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In lieu of filing as heretofore provided, corner records may be recorded electronically in those counties that have such facilities.

        Bureau of land management publications are not statutes and they may not be utilized to establish burdens of proof in real property disputes involving lost or obliterated corners. State ex rel. Evans v. Barnett, 116 Idaho 429, 776 P.2d 438 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute concerning the location of the section line forming the legal boundary between the land owned by the state and the adjoining property owners, the state had the initial burden of coming forward with evidence showing the original survey point of the corner could not be determined and its location could be restored only by reference to adjacent corners. If this burden is met, the adjoining property owners, in order to sustain their contention that the corner is obliterated, must come forward with evidence showing although there are no remaining traces of the original monument, either the location has been perpetuated or the point may be recovered beyond reasonable doubt by other acceptable evidence. State ex rel. Evans v. Barnett, 114 Idaho 355, 757 P.2d 218 (Ct. App. 1988).
    Where neither expert witness believed beyond a reasonable doubt that the place marked by a timber cruiser in or near the fence was an obliterated corner, the state met its burden of proving the corner was lost and was properly restored through proportional measurements derived from the original surveyor’s field notes.

If the requirements are not met within the time allowed, the commission shall enter an order rejecting the registration which shall state the basis for the rejection and advise the applicant of his right to request a hearing before the commission. The order rejecting the registration shall not become effective for twenty (20) days after service of the order, during which time the applicant may make a written request for a hearing.

All expenditures from said fund by the commission under the provisions of this chapter shall be paid out on warrants drawn by the state controller upon presentation of proper vouchers approved by the commission. Such claims and supporting vouchers shall be examined by the state board of examiners in the same manner as other claims against the state of Idaho.

       <p>
        The record before the magistrate did not support his conclusion that a criminal act occurred in 1985 because the document filed by the defendant in 1985 was a land survey and not a plat. For a subdivision to have occurred under the ordinance there must have been a division of land for the purpose of transfer of ownership for development. A land survey does not divide land, nor does the filing of such a survey indicate with what intent the landowner surveyed his property, and because there was no support in the record for the conclusion that a criminal act occurred in 1985, the statute of limitations for the misdemeanor charges of illegal subdivision brought against the defendant had not run and the magistrate erred in dismissing the complaint.

        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 184, substituted “Community resident” for “Tenant” in the section heading; and rewrote the section, which formerly read: “The tenants in a mobile home park have the right to organize a tenant or homeowner’s association to further their mutual interest and to conduct any other business and programs which the association shall determine. An association shall have the right to use the facilities of the park to conduct its business and programs. When an association is organized it shall notify the landlord.”

        Tenant presented evidence and argument that the landlord was seeking his eviction because of the tenant’s complaints to the landlord about excessive electrical rate charges and late fees; thus, the tenant raised the defense of a violation of subsection (b), and the magistrate erred by not referencing this code section or making any findings on the defense in his oral ruling at trial or in his subsequent written judgment.

      § 55-2201. Legislative intent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this chapter to create a system of stakeholder-driven education and enforcement addressing the prevention of damage to underground facilities, to assign responsibilities for locating and keeping accurate records of underground facility locations, for preventing and repairing damage to existing underground facilities, for collecting, storing, analyzing and disseminating data related to underground facility damage and excavator downtime events, and for protecting the public health and safety from great personal harm including death, property damage and interruption in vital services caused by damage to existing underground facilities. It is further the intent of the legislature that the state of Idaho, by adopting this chapter, reaffirms its primacy over underground facility damage prevention programs that protect the health, safety and property of its citizens and that, by adopting this chapter, Idaho precludes the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration of the United States department of transportation from determining that Idaho’s damage prevention enforcement is inadequate pursuant to 49 CFR part 198, as adopted on July 9, 2015, and effective on January 1, 2016, and prevents any subsequent federal administrative enforcement actions that would result from such a formal determination.

       An excavator who, in the course of excavation, contacts or damages an underground facility shall notify the underground facility owner and the one-number notification service. If the damage causes an emergency condition or an actual breach of an underground facility that releases gas or hazardous liquids into the surrounding environment, the excavator causing the damage shall also alert the appropriate local public safety agencies by, at a minimum, calling 911, and take all appropriate steps to ensure the public safety. No damaged underground facility may be buried until it is repaired or relocated.

       The damage prevention board established in section 55-2203, Idaho Code, may hear, but may not initiate, contested cases of alleged violations of this chapter involving practices related to underground facilities as set forth in rules by the board. Persons who violate the provisions of this chapter are subject to civil penalties in accordance with this section. Complaints regarding an alleged violation of this chapter may be made by any individual and shall be made to the administrator. Complaints shall include the name and address of the complainant and the alleged violator, and the violation alleged. If the alleged violation involves facility damage or a downtime event, the complaint must be submitted on such forms and contain such information as required by the board in rule. Upon review of the complaint, and any investigation conducted therewith, the administrator shall notify the person making the complaint and the alleged violator, in writing, of the administrator’s recommended course of action to the board. The administrator shall recommend that a training course adopted by the board, by rule, be successfully completed for a first violation of this chapter, except that if the complaint is for a first violation of this chapter wherein a residential homeowner or residential tenant excavating on the lot of his residency failed to provide notice as required in section 55-2205, Idaho Code, and caused damage to underground facilities, the board shall direct the administrator to deliver to the violator a written warning and educational materials to prevent a future violation. The administrator may recommend the imposition of a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for a second violation of this chapter and in addition may recommend successful completion of a training course adopted by the board, by rule, and issue a notice of intent to impose such penalty on behalf of the board. If the administrator recommends the imposition of a civil penalty, the violator may pay the fine to the board upon receipt of such notice. If, upon the expiration of twenty-one (21) days, the violator has not responded in writing to the division, the board may impose the penalty provided for in the notice. A violator shall also have the right to contest the imposition of a civil penalty to the board and the opportunity to produce evidence in his behalf. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be provided by the board, and such proceeding shall be governed by the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

       In the event the board determines that a person has violated the provisions of this chapter a subsequent time within eighteen (18) months from an earlier violation, and where facility damage has occurred, the board may impose a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each separate violation in accordance with the process described in subsection (1) of this section.
    (3) All civil penalties recovered shall be deposited in the underground facility damage prevention board fund and used pursuant to section 55-2204(2), Idaho Code.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (4) The penalties provided in this section are in addition to any other remedy at law or equity available to any party subject to the jurisdiction of the damage prevention board established in section 55-2203, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) Unless expressly provided herein, nothing in this chapter eliminates, alters or otherwise impairs common law, statutory or other preexisting rights and duties of persons affected by the provisions of this chapter; nor does anything in this chapter, unless expressly so provided, eliminate, alter or otherwise impair other remedies, state or federal, including those at common law, of an underground facility owner whose facility is damaged; nor do the provisions of this chapter affect any civil remedies for personal injury or property damage except as expressly provided for herein. The court in its discretion may award attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to create any liability on the part of the operator to the lessee for any loss of or damage to the lessee’s personal property, regardless of cause.

       A reasonable late fee may be imposed and collected by an operator for each period that a lessee does not pay rent, fees, or other charges when due under the rental agreement, if the amount of the late fee and the conditions for imposing the fee are stated in the rental agreement. A late fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) or twenty percent (20%) of the monthly rent, whichever is greater, is a reasonable fee and will not be considered a penalty.

      § 55-2515. Rescission by transferee.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to section 55-2504, Idaho Code, if a transferee of residential real property receives a property disclosure form or an amendment of that form as described in section 55-2508, Idaho Code, after the transferee has entered into a transfer agreement with respect to the property, the transferee, after his receipt of the form or amendment may rescind the transfer agreement in a written, signed and dated document that is delivered to the transferor or his agents in accordance with section 55-2510, Idaho Code. Transferee’s rescission must be based on a specific objection to a disclosure in the disclosure statement. The notice of rescission shall specifically identify the disclosure objected to by the transferee. Transferee incurs no legal liability to the transferor because of the rescission including, but not limited to, a civil action for specific performance of the transfer agreement. Upon the rescission of the transfer agreement the transferee is entitled to the return of, and the transferor shall return, any deposits made by the transferee in connection with the proposed transfer of the residential real property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of section 55-2505, Idaho Code, a rescission of a transfer agreement may only occur if the transferee’s written, signed and dated document of rescission is delivered to the transferor or his agent or subagent within three (3) business days following the date on which the transferee or his agent receives the property disclosure form prescribed under section 55-2508, Idaho Code. If no signed notice of rescission is received by the transferor within the three (3) day period, transferee’s right to rescind is waived.

       PREFATORY NOTE
      </h4>
      <p>
       Environmental covenants — whether called “institutional controls”, “land use controls” or some other term — are increasingly being used as part of the environmental remediation process for contaminated real property. An environmental covenant typically is used when the real property is to be cleaned up to a level determined by the potential environmental risks posed by a particular use, rather than to unrestricted use standards. Such risk-based remediation is both environmentally and economically preferable in many circumstances, although it will often allow the parties to leave residual contamination in the real property. An environmental covenant is then used to implement this risk-based cleanup by controlling the potential risks presented by that residual contamination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two principal policies are served by confirming the validity of environmental covenants. One is to ensure that land use restrictions, mandated environmental monitoring requirements, and a wide range of common engineering controls designed to control the potential environmental risk of residual contamination will be reflected on the land records and effectively enforced over time as a valid real property servitude. This Act addresses a variety of common law doctrines — the same doctrines that led to adoption of the Uniform Conservation Easement Act — that cast doubt on such enforceability.
      </p>
      <p>
       A second important policy served by this Act is the return of previously contaminated property, often located in urban areas, to the stream of commerce. The environmental and real property legal communities have often been unable to identify a common set of principles applicable to such properties. The frequent result has been that these properties do not attract interested purchasers and therefore remain vacant, blighted and unproductive. This is an undesirable outcome for communities seeking to return once important commercial sites to productive use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Large numbers of contaminated sites are unlikely to be successfully recycled until regulators, potentially responsible parties, affected communities, prospective purchasers and their lenders become confident that environmental covenants will be properly drafted, implemented, monitored and enforced for so long as needed. This Act should encourage transfer of ownership and property re-use by offering a clear and objective process for creating, modifying or terminating environmental covenants and for recording these actions in recorded instruments which will be reflected in the title abstract of the property in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, risk-based remediation must effectively control the potential risk presented by the residual contamination that remains in the real property and thereby protect human health and the environment. When risk-based remediation imposes restrictions on how the property may be used after the cleanup, requires continued monitoring of the site, or requires construction of permanent containment or other remedial structures on the site, environmental covenants are crucial tools to make these restrictions and requirements effective. Yet environmental covenants can do so only if their legal status under state property law and their practical enforceability are assured, as this proposed Uniform Act seeks to do.
    At the time this Act was promulgated, approximately half the states had laws providing for land use restrictions in conjunction with risk-based remedies. Those existing laws vary greatly in scope — some simply note the need for land use restrictions, while others create tools similar to many of the legal structures envisioned by this Act. Most such acts apply only to cleanups under a state program.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, this Act includes a number of provisions absent from most existing state laws, including the Act’s applicability to both federal and state-led cleanups. For example, this Act expressly precludes the application of traditional common law doctrines that might hinder enforcement. It ensures that a covenant will survive despite tax lien foreclosure, adverse possession, and marketable title statutes. The Act also provides detailed provisions regarding termination and amendment of older covenants, and includes important provisions on dealing with recorded interests that have priority over the new covenant. Further, it offers guidance to courts confronted with a proceeding that seeks to terminate such a covenant through eminent domain or the doctrine of changed circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act benefitted greatly during the drafting process from broad stakeholder input. As a result, the Act contains unique provisions designed to protect a variety of interests commonly absent in existing state laws. For example, the Act confers on property owners that grant an environmental covenant the right to enforce the covenant and requires their consent to any termination or modification. This should mitigate an owner’s future liability concerns for residual contamination and encourage the sale and reuse of contaminated properties. And, following traditional real property principles, the Act validates the interests of lenders who hold a prior mortgage on the contaminated property, absent voluntary subordination.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to emphasize that environmental covenants are but one tool in a larger context of environmental remediation regulation; remediation is typically overseen by a government agency enforcing substantial statutory and regulatory requirements. The covenant should be the crucial end result of that process — it may be used to ensure that the activity and use limitations imposed in the agency’s remedial decision process remain effective, and thus protect the public from residual contamination that remains, while also permitting re-use of the site in a timely and economically valuable way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Environmental remediation projects may be done in a widely diverse array of contamination fact patterns and regulatory contexts. For example, the remediation may be done at a large industrial operating or waste disposal site. In such a situation, the cleanup could be done under federal law and regulation, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). Generally speaking, CERCLA and RCRA would also apply to remediation done at Department of Defense or Department of Energy sites that are anticipated to be transferred out of federal ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other situations, state law and regulation will be an effective regulatory framework for remediation projects. State law is given a role to play in the federal environmental policy discussed above. Beyond this, state law may be the primary source of regulatory authority for many remediation projects. These may include larger sites and will often include smaller, typically urban, sites. In addition, many states authorize and supervise voluntary cleanup efforts, and these also may find environmental covenants a useful policy tool. With both state and federal environmental remediation projects, the applicable cleanup statutes and regulations will provide the basis for the restrictions and controls to be included in the resulting environmental covenants.
    This Act does not supplant or impose substantive clean-up standards, either generally or in a particular case. The Act assumes those standards will be developed in a prior regulatory proceeding. Rather, the Act is intended to validate site-specific, environmental use restrictions resulting from an environmental response project that proposes to leave residual contamination in the ground in any of the different situations described above. Once the governing regulatory authority and the property owner have determined to use a risk-based approach to cleanup to protect the public from residual contamination, this Act supplies the legal infrastructure for creating and enforcing the environmental covenant under state law.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act does not require issuance of regulations. However, many state and federal agencies have developed implementation tools, including model covenants, statements of best practices, and advisory groups that include members of the real property and environmental practice bars as well as business and environmental groups. Developing and sharing such implementation tools and the advice of such advisory groups should support the effective implementation of the Act and is encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act does not address or change the larger context of environmental remediation regulation discussed above, and a number of aspects of that regulation should be noted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, many contaminated properties are subject to the concurrent regulatory jurisdiction of both federal and state agencies. This Act does not address the exercise of such concurrent jurisdiction, and it is not intended to limit the jurisdiction of any state agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       A specific issue arises with federal property that is not anticipated to be transferred to a non-federal owner. This Act takes no position regarding the question of whether remediation of such property is subject to State regulatory jurisdiction. In contrast, where federal property is transferred to a non-federal owner, state agencies will clearly have jurisdiction over environmental covenants on the transferred property where state environmental law so provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, potential purchasers of property subject to an environmental covenant should be aware that both state and federal environmental law other than this Act may authorize reopening the environmental remediation determination, even after the relevant statutory standards have been met on that site. While such reopeners are rare, they may be possible to respond either to newly-discovered contamination or new scientific knowledge of the risk posed by existing contamination. As a consequence, under existing environmental law, the then-current owner may have remediation liability. While the dampening effect of such potential liability on the willingness of potential purchasers to buy contaminated property is clear, the issue remains important in the eyes of some interest groups. Federal law now provides protection for bona fide purchasers of such property under specified circumstances, and the law of some states may also afford some protection. However, this Act does not provide any such bona fide purchaser protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       For these and other reasons, it is important that prospective purchasers of contaminated properties — particularly those successors who may buy some years after a clean-up has been completed — have actual knowledge of covenants at the time of purchase. Environmental covenants recorded pursuant to this Act will provide constructive notice of the covenant and in many circumstances recording will provide actual notice. However, to ensure that such persons have actual notice, a state or a local recording authority may wish to highlight the existence of environmental covenants in their communities with maps showing the location of properties subject to environmental covenants, similar to the kinds of maps commonly found in local land records offices to show the location of zoning districts or flood plains.

       LEGISLATIVE NOTES
      </h4>
      <p>
       Non Participating Owner.
    This Act contemplates a situation where a risk based clean-up is agreed to by the regulatory agency and the parties responsible for the clean-up, potentially including the fee owner and the owners of other interests in the property. As a consequence of that agreement, the Act assumes those parties will each negotiate the terms of and then sign the covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act assumes the owners of appropriate interests in contaminated property will be willing to sign the covenant. Cooperation is not always possible, however. State and federal regulatory systems make a number of parties, in addition to the current owner of a fee simple or some other interests, potentially liable for the cost of remediation of contaminated real property. As a result, a remediation project may proceed even though an owner is no longer present or interested in the property. In those circumstances, the remediation project would be conducted pursuant to regulatory orders and could be financed either by other liable parties or by public funds. However, an environmental covenant may still be a useful tool in implementing the remediation project even in these situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an owner is either unavailable or unwilling to participate in the environmental response project, it may be appropriate to condemn and take a partial interest in the real property in order to be able to record a valid servitude on it. Under the law of some states, states have the power to take that owner’s interest by condemnation proceedings, paying the value of the interest taken, and then enter an environmental covenant as an owner. Where there is substantial contamination, the property may have little or no market value. In some states the court would take the cost of remediation into account in establishing the fair market value of the interest taken. See, e.g., Northeast Ct. Economic Alliance, Inc. v. ATC Partnership, 256 Conn. 813, 776 A.2d 1068 (2001). Although effective implementation of this Act may require that the state have a power of condemnation, this Act does not provide a substantive statutory basis for that power, and the state must therefore rely on other state law. Each state considering adoption of this Act should ensure that such a condemnation power is available for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, while this Act provides substantive law governing creation, modification, and termination of environmental covenants, it does not include special administrative procedures for these and does not change the remedial decision making process. Rather, the Act presumes that the state’s general administrative law or any specific procedure governing the environmental response project would apply to these activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Actual” versus “Constructive” Notice of Contamination.
    The primary goal of the Act is to present to the states a statute that fully integrates environmental covenants into the traditional real property system. It seeks to ensure the long-term viability of those covenants by, among other means, providing constructive notice of those covenants to the world through resort to the land recording system.
      </p>

       Beyond that goal, it is very important to provide actual knowledge of the remaining contaminated conditions that the environmental covenants are designed to control. A broad range of stakeholders — children and adults that might inadvertently gain access to the contamination, tenants on the property, owners, abutting neighbors, prospective buyers, lenders, government officials, title insurance companies, public health providers and others — will have a real personal and financial stake in knowing what properties in their communities suffer from contamination and the extent of the risks they confront. The fact that this law may provide legally sufficient knowledge of those conditions is no substitute for real information regarding those conditions.
    The challenge of providing that information is beyond the scope of this Act. However, in analogous situations — the location of zoning districts, flood plain boundaries, utility easements, and dangerous street conditions, for example — governments have devised techniques to make the public aware of those conditions on a continuing basis. Techniques such as maps in recorders’ offices, on-site signage and monuments and, increasingly, computer databases accessible to the public are examples of possible solutions. All such devices have fiscal implications and are best addressed on a local basis. Over the long term, however, the public will likely be well served by innovative solutions to these issues.

        Section 4 [§ 55-3004] of the Act makes clear that an environmental covenant is valid if only one agency signs it. However, in many circumstances, both a federal and a state agency may have jurisdiction over the environmental contamination that led to the environmental response project. In this situation, the best practice may be for both federal and state agencies with jurisdiction over the contaminated property to sign the environmental covenant.

       <li id="t55c30s55-3002-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol15">
        Definition (4) states that an environmental covenant is a “servitude”; the term generally refers to either a burden or restriction on the use of real property, or to a benefit that flows from the ownership of land, that in either case “runs with the land” — that is, the benefit or the burden passes to successive owners of the real property.
    The law of servitudes is a long established body of real property law. The term is defined in §1.1 of the Restatement (3d) of Servitudes as follows: “(1) A servitude is a legal device that creates a right or an obligation that runs with land or an interest in land.” The Restatement goes on to provide that the forms of servitudes which are subject to that Restatement are “easements, profits, and covenants.”
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3002-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol16">
        The definition of “environmental covenant” also provides that the servitude is created to implement an environmental response project. An environmental response project may determine, in some circumstances, to leave some residual contamination on the real property. This may be done because complete cleanup is technologically impossible, or because it is either ecologically or economically undesirable. In this situation, the environmental response project may impose activity and use limitations to control residual risk that results from contamination remaining in real property. An environmental covenant is then recorded on the land records as required by Section 8 [§ 55-3008] to ensure that the activity and use limitations are both legally and practically enforceable.
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3002-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol17">
        An “environmental response project” covered by definition (5) may be undertaken pursuant to authorization by one of several different statutes. Definition (5)(a) specifically covers remediation projects required under state law. However, the definition is written broadly to also encompass both current federal law, future amendments to both state and federal law, as well as new environmental protection regimes should they be developed. Without limiting this breadth and generality, the Act intends to reach environmental response projects undertaken pursuant to any of the following specific federal statutes:
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3002-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol18">
        Definition (5)(c) extends the Act’s coverage to voluntary remediation projects that are undertaken under state law. Environmental covenants that are part of voluntary remediation projects may serve both the goal of environmental protection and the goal of facilitating reuse of the real property. However, approval of these projects by a governmental body or other authorized party ensures that the project serves these goals. Even though preparation of the clean-up plan and supervision of the work may be undertaken by private parties, this Act requires that covenants undertaken as part of a formal voluntary clean-up program must be approved by the agency as evidenced by the agency’s signature on the covenant, in order to be effective under this Act.
    9. Some states authorize properly certified private parties to supervise remediation to pre-existing standards and certify the cleanup. For example, in Connecticut and Massachusetts, these are “licensed site professionals”.
    See
    , e.g., M.G.L. ch. 21A §19; 310 CMR 40.1071; C.G.S. §§22a-133o, 22a-133y. Supervision and certification by statutorily-authorized parties is intended to accomplish the same public function as supervision and certification by the governmental entity. Thus, these environmental response projects are also covered by this definition.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       (2) an activity required to be conducted on the real property, including monitoring, reporting, or operating procedures and maintenance for physical controls or devices,
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) any right of access necessary to implement the activity and use limitations, and
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) any physical structure or device required to be placed on the real property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The specific activity and use limitations in any covenant will depend on the nature of the proceeding in the environmental response project that led to the covenant. For example, in a major environmental response project where the administrative process was conducted by either a state or federal agency, the activity and use limitations would generally be identified in the record of decision and then implemented in the environmental covenant pursuant to this Act. In contrast, in a voluntary clean-up supervised by privately licensed professionals, as authorized in some states, the activity and use limitations would not be developed by the agency during an administrative proceeding but by the parties themselves and their contracted professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this Act prevents the use of privately negotiated use restrictions which are recorded in the land records, without agency involvement: the validity of such covenants, however, is not governed by this Act but by other law of the enacting state.
    See
    Section 5(d) [§ 55-3005(4)].
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, as noted in Comment 1, the definition of “environmental response project” contemplates the possibility that the project may be undertaken pursuant to a voluntary clean-up program, where the actual determination of the sufficiency of the proposed clean-up is made by a private professional party, rather than an agency. In this case, the definition contemplates that an agency — typically, the state environmental agency — will nevertheless be asked to consent to the environmental covenant by signing it. Section 4 [§ 55-3004] of the Act makes clear that the covenant is not valid under this Act unless an agency signs it. Section 3 [§ 55-3003] of the Act makes clear that the mere signature of the agency, without more, means only that the agency has “approved” the covenant in order to satisfy the definitional requirements of definition (2) and the mandated contents of Section 4 [§ 55-3004]. That signature imposes no duties or obligations on the agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, in some cases, the appropriate federal agency may be the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Defense as ‘lead agency’ under federal law, or another body.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act emphasizes that an environmental covenant is a servitude in order to implicate this full body of real property law and to sustain the validity and enforceability of the covenant. By first characterizing the environmental covenant as a servitude, the Act expressly avoids the argument that an environmental covenant is simply a personal common law contract between the agency and the owner of the real property at the time the covenant is signed, and thus is not binding on later owners or tenants of that land.

       10. Under definition (5)(c), environmental response projects may include specific agreements between an owner and the agency for remediation that go beyond prevailing requirements. Alternatively, an owner may choose to contract with a potential purchaser for additional use restrictions in an instrument that does not purport to come within this Act;
    see
    Section 5(d) [§ 55-3005(4)]. Because the owner may have residual liability for the site, even after remediation and transfer to a third party for redevelopment, the owner may require further restrictions as a condition of creating the environmental covenant and eventual reuse of the real property.
      </p>
      <p>
       11. The definition of “holder” is in definition (6). As the practice of using environmental covenants continues to grow, new entities may emerge to serve as holders. This Act does not intend to limit this process. A holder may be any person under the broad definition of this Act, including an affected local government, the agency, or an owner. The identity of an individual holder must be approved by the agency and an owner as part of the process of creating an environmental covenant, as specified in Section 4 [§ 55-3004]. A holder is authorized to enforce the covenant under Section 11 [§ 55-3011]. A holder has the rights specified in Section 4 [§ 55-3004] of this Act and may be given additional rights or obligations in the environmental covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3(a) [§ 55-3003(1)] makes clear that a holder’s interest is an interest in real property. Some environmental enforcement agencies are not authorized by their enabling legislation to own an interest in real property after the environmental remediation is completed. As a consequence, those agencies may not be entitled to serve as holders under the Act. In those cases where an agency wishes to be certain that a viable holder exists, a private entity may serve this purpose, acting, for example by contract, in accordance with the agency’s direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       More generally, the nature of a holder’s interest in the real property may influence whether its rights and duties with respect to the real property are likely to lead to potential liability for future environmental remediation, should such remediation become necessary. Under CERCLA, an “owner” is liable for remediation costs;
    see
    42 U.S.C.A. 9607(a)(1). Unfortunately, the definition of “owner” in the statute is circular and unhelpful in evaluating whether a holder is potentially liable under it. 42 U.S.C.A. 9601(20).
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, a holder’s right to enforce the covenant under Section 11 [§ 55-3011] should be considered comparable to the rights covered in an easement and, thus, should not lead to a determination that the holder is liable as an “owner” under CERCLA. The two cases that have considered this question have found that the parties which held the easements were not CERCLA “owners”.
    Long Beach Unified School District v. Dorothy B. Godwin California Living Trust,
    32 F.3d 1364 (9th Cir. 1994);
    <i>
     Grand Trunk RR. V. Acme Belt Recoating,
    </i>
    859 F. Supp. 1125 (W.D. MI 1994). In each case, the court reasoned that the circular definition of owner meant that the term’s most common meaning would prevail. The common law’s distinction between an easement holder and the property owner was then applied to find the easement holder not to be an “owner” for purposes of this statute. In each of these cases, the party that held the easement had not contributed to contamination on the property. The amendments to CERCLA Section 9601(35), Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, Pub. L. No. 107-118, 115 Stat. 2360 (2002) (HR 2869, 107th Cong. 1st Session), added the term “easement” to the definition of parties which are in a “contractual relationship” under CERCLA. However, this does not affect whether the easement holder will be held to be a CERCLA “owner”.
    Where the holder or another person has more extensive rights than enforcement, a careful analysis will be required. The CERCLA liability cases typically emphasize that a party that exercises the degree of control over a site equivalent to the control typically exercised by an owner of the site will be held liable as an “owner”. Under this approach, for example, lessees have been held liable as owners when their control over the site approximated that which an owner would have.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    , e.g.,
    <i>
     Delaney v. Town of Carmel,
    </i>
    55 F. Supp. 2d 237 (S.D.N.Y. 1999);
    <i>
     U.S. v. A &amp; N Cleaners and Launderers,
    </i>
    788 F. Supp. 1317 (S.D.N.Y. 1992);
    <i>
     U.S. v. S.C. Dept. of Health and Env. Control,
    </i>
    653 F. Supp. 984 (D.S.C. 1984.) Accordingly, a holder contemplating extensive control over the site should consider potential “owner” liability carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       CERCLA liability also extends to an “operator” of the site (42 U.S.C.A. 9607(a)(1)), and the case law interpreting this definition emphasizes that a party is liable as an operator if it has a high degree of control over the operating decisions and day to day management at the site. Thus, for example, a party that held an easement could be liable as an operator if its degree of control met this standard. A holder will, in general, have only control authority over the site related to effective enforcement of the environmental covenant and does not typically need more extensive day to day control. However, this will not likely be true in all cases.

       Subsection (a) [(1)] confirms that the holder holds an interest in real property, thus distinguishing that right from a personal or contractual right that does not run with the land. The definition of ‘holder’ in Section 2 [§ 55-3002], departing from traditional real property concepts, makes clear that the holder may be the agency or the owner, thus making it possible for the owner to be both grantor and grantee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) [(1)] also makes clear that if the agency chooses to be the holder, the agency will thereby hold an interest in the real property. Otherwise, subsection (b) [(2)] provides that the agency’s interest in the covenant as a consequence of signing the covenant or having a right to enforce it under this Act is not an interest in real property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [(3)] validates and confirms any contractual obligations that an agency may assume in an environmental covenant. So, for example, if the agency were to agree to authorize certain activities on the property, to undertake periodic inspections of the site or to provide notice of particular actions to specified persons, those undertakings and obligations would be enforceable against the agency in accordance with their terms by parties adversely affected by any breach.
    At the same time, subsection (c) [(3)] also makes clear that the mere act of signing the covenant in order to signify the agency’s ‘approval’ of the covenant, which is required by the Act as a condition of its effectiveness under this Act, is not an assumption of obligations and the agency has not thereby exposed itself to any liability. The agency manifests its approval of an environmental covenant by signing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) [(4)] restates and clarifies traditional real property rules regarding the effect of an environmental covenant on prior recorded interests. The basic rule remains that pre-existing prior valid and effective interests — “First in time, first in right” — remain valid. As § 7.1 of the Restatement (3d) of Property: Mortgages states:
      </p>
      <p>
       A valid foreclosure of a mortgage terminates all interests in the foreclosed real estate that are junior [that is, later in time] to the mortgage being foreclosed . . . . Foreclosure does not terminate interests . . . that are senior . . ..
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, it is not uncommon for interested parties to re-order the priorities among them by agreement in order to accommodate the economic interests of various parties. The usual device used to re-order priorities is a so-called ‘subordination’ agreement. Again, this section tracks the outcome suggested in
    The Restatement (3d) of Property: Mortgages.
    Section 7.7 of the Restatement provides in pertinent part that:
      </p>
      <p>
       A mortgage, by a declaration of its mortgagee, [that is, the lender] may be made subordinate in priority to another interest in the mortgaged real estate, whether existing or to be created in the future . . . . A subordination that would materially prejudice the mortgagor [that is, the owner of the real estate] or the person whose interest is advanced in priority is ineffective without the consent of the person prejudiced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The impact of the newly recorded environmental covenant on the priorities of other lien holders is sufficiently important that the Act emphasizes this issue both in this section and in Sections 8(b) and 9(c) [§§ 55-3008(2) and 55-3009(3)]. In all these instances, the Act provides that the usual rules of priorities are preserved, except in the case of foreclosure of tax liens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, in preparing an environmental covenant, it might be advisable for the agency to identify all prior interests, determine which interests may interfere with the covenant protecting human health and the environment, and then take steps to avoid the possibility of such interference. The agency may do this by, for example, having the parties obtain appropriate subordination of prior interests, as a condition to the agency’s approval of the environmental covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The combined effect of Sections 3, 8 and 9 [§§ 55-3003, 55-3008, and 55-3009] creates a curious “circular” lien problem, where (1) foreclosure of a 2003 municipal tax lien would terminate a 2000 pre-existing mortgage (the usual outcome), but (2) that same foreclosure would not affect the environmental covenant created in 2002 under this Act; while (3) foreclosure of the 2000 pre-existing mortgage would terminate the 2002 environmental covenant (again, the usual rule), but (4) not the 2003 municipal tax lien (also, the usual rule). Circular liens, however, are not unique to this situation.

        Subsection (a)(2) [(1)(b)] of this section requires that the covenant contain a “legally sufficient description” of the “real property” subject to the covenant. While these terms are familiar to real property practitioners, it may be useful to describe precisely what is required by this section.
    First, a description of the real property that is “legally sufficient” will depend upon the practice of the enacting state. The purpose of such a requirement, for the real property practitioner, will be to assure that the particular parcel subject to the covenant will be properly indexed in the land records and thus readily located during the course of a title search. This, in turn, will enable a buyer, lender or other interest holder to be confident of what they own or hold as security.
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3004-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol12">
        This Act does not provide the standards for environmental remediation nor the specific activity and use limitations to be used at a particular site. Those will be provided by the state or federal agency based on other state and federal law governing mandatory and voluntary cleanups. This Act contemplates that those standards will then be incorporated into the environmental response project, which, in turn, will call for activity and use restrictions that can be implemented through creation of an environmental covenant. This section addresses creation of the environmental covenants.
    3. Ordinarily, an environmental covenant will be created only by agreement between the agency and the owner. If there is a holder other than the agency or the owner, both the agency and the owner must approve the holder, and the holder must agree to the terms of the covenant. The agency may refuse to agree to an environmental covenant if it does not effectively implement the activity and use limitations specified in the environmental response project.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The most commonly used legal descriptions of land are: (1) a metes and bounds description — that is, a description that begins with reference to a known point on the surface of the earth, followed by references to distances and angles from that point to other monuments or terminals that mark the outer boundaries of the parcel; (2) reference to a recorded map or survey, that contains a “picture” of the metes and bounds description; (3) reference to a particular parcel number on a governmental grid system; and (4) a coordinates reference system, derived from a Global Positioning System or other mapping tool. These, and other generally obsolete forms of legal description [e.g., “starting at the black oak tree in the pasture, then running along a stone wall to Bloody Creek, then generally south and west along the creek to a dirt road, then back to the tree where you started, being the same 50 acres, more or less, conveyed to my father by Lisman”] may all serve the same purpose, and would meet the requirement of being “legally sufficient.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, as described in Comment 11 below, more precise measurements may be very useful for identifying precisely the “geospatial” location of sub-surface contaminants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the “real property” that is subject to the covenant may be narrowly or broadly defined, depending on the wishes of the parties. It may be, for example, that only a 3 acre portion of a 5,000 acre ranch is contaminated; in such a case, it may be unnecessary to describe all 5000 acres of real property as being subject to the covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, in a remote location, it may be that the 3 acre contaminated parcel owned by one person may be reached only by crossing a private road located on a 5000 acre ranch owned by another person. In such a case, a careful property description will want to include reference to the easement or other access right across the land owned by another person.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to recognize, however, that real property is a three-dimensional concept (or a four-dimensional concept when one considers time as a dimension). A legal description of a particular parcel of real property which has only perimeter boundaries and no upper and lower boundaries encompasses both the surface of the earth within those boundaries, the airspace above the surface, all the dirt and minerals below the surface and all spaces within that volume of space that may be filled with water. Thus, in appropriate cases, a title searcher will need to be sensitive to cases where interests in the “real property” or “real property” have been sold or leased which leave the owner with less than all of the real property. A ten-year lease of the entire parcel, for example, represents a time-defined “boundary” to the owner’s interest in the real property in question. An agency seeking to identify all the interests in the parcel in order to secure their approval of a covenant will therefore want to ensure that a title search identifies all these interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no owner is available or willing to participate in the environmental response project, it may be necessary for the agency to condemn and take an interest sufficient to record an environmental covenant on the property where it has the power to do so. This Act does not contain independent condemnation authority for the agency. Alternatively, in some states, there may be a basis for an agency to require an owner to cooperate with the implementation of the covenant as a regulatory matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. This Act recognizes that there may be situations in which there is more than one fee simple owner. For example, Husband and Wife may own Blackacre as tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants of the entirety. In all of these configurations of ownership, both Husband and Wife are owners of Blackacre and both must sign an environmental covenant unless the agency waives this requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, it is common practice in mining states, such as Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, for the fee ownership of the mineral interests to be conveyed separate and apart from the fee ownership of the remaining parcel. Thus, under the conventional real property practices of these states, there may be two separate fee ownership interests in the same “parcel” of real property, and each owner must sign the environmental covenant unless this requirement is waived. It may be that those two owners of different interests in the same parcel have an agreement between them prohibiting separate conveyances of interests in the land without permission of the other. However, if that agreement does not appear of record, it would not run with the land, would likely not be binding on the agency [in the absence of the agency’s actual knowledge] and thus not affect the validity of a covenant signed by one of the owners with respect to that owner’s interest in the real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. In addition to the parties specified in Section 4(a)(5) [§ 55-3004(1)(e)], other persons may wish to sign the environmental covenant and, in any event, the agency may require their signature as a condition of approving the covenant. (See Section 4(c) [§ 55-3004(3)]). Under current law, persons other than the owner may be liable for cleanup of the contamination, including contingent future liability if further cleanup is needed or personal injury claims are brought. These could be parties which previously used the property or whose waste was disposed of on the property. Such a person may have liability for some or all of the cost of the environmental response project and may thus have a compelling interest in signing the covenant so as to be informed of future enforcement, modification and termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       6. Section 4(a)(5) [§ 55-3004(1)(e)] also authorizes the agency to waive the requirement that the covenant be signed by the owner of the fee simple. The Act contemplates that such waivers should be rare because in most situations the covenant can be effective only if the fee owner’s interest is subject to the covenant. However, in some circumstances the fee owner may have transferred most or all of the economic value of the property to the holder of another interest, either permanently or for the time period during which the covenant’s restrictions are needed. Consider, for example, the situation in which the contamination remaining presents environmental risks for only twenty years and the property is subject to a ninety-nine year lease. In this case, it is critical that the owner of the leasehold interest be a party to the covenant so its interest will be subject to it. However, in this situation, the fee owner’s participation is not essential for the covenant to protect human health and the environment. If the fee owner is unavailable or unwilling to participate, the agency might choose to waive its signature. Of course, such a situation, when the likely duration of the covenant is both short and clearly known, is likely to be exceptional.
    7. A holder is the grantee of the environmental covenant and the Act requires that there be a holder for a covenant to be valid and enforceable. Under Section 5(b)(9) [§ 55-3009(2)(i)], the grantee may also be the grantor, who is the owner of the property and who might remain a holder upon sale of the property, or the agency. In addition to enforcement rights, the holder may be given specific rights or obligations with respect to future implementation of the environmental covenant. These could include, for example, the obligation to monitor groundwater or maintain a cap or containment structure on the property. Such rights and obligations will be specified in the environmental covenant and, like any obligations, would be enforceable against the holder if the holder failed to satisfy its obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
       8. Section 4(a)(5) [§ 55-3004(1)(e)] requires an agency to sign the covenant. In some states it may be necessary to amend the state agency’s enabling statute to empower it to so sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       9. Section 4(a)(6) [§ 55-3004(1)(f)] requires the covenant to disclose the “name and location of any administrative record” for the underlying environmental response project. Typically, this information will require a docket or file number, identifying names of the parties, and an indication of the agency office in which the record of decision or other administrative record has been retained. In those cases where a state-wide registry is maintained, the registry also requires this information. In the case of voluntary clean-ups, of course, there may not be an administrative record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section (4)(b) [§ 55-3004(2)] is a permissive provision intended by the breadth of its provisions (“. . . may contain other information . . . agreed to by the persons who signed it.”) to encourage the agency and the other parties to include provisions in the particular covenant that are tailored to the specific needs of that project. This may well be accomplished in order to maximize the likelihood that the covenant, when properly implemented and monitored, will protect human health and the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons dealing with this Act must recognize that no statute and no commentary can fully contemplate all the possibilities that are likely to arise in implementation of this Act. This issue permeates this subsection. In (b)(1) [(2)(a)], for example, the text contemplates the possibility that the agency may, in a particular case, require an owner or other persons to notify the agency before, among other things, that party applies for “. . . building permits.” The suggested language is not intended to exclude notice of any other type of work permit that might trigger a violation of an environmental covenant, such as, for example, drilling or excavation permits.
      </p>
      <p>
       10. Section 4(b)(4) [§ 55-3004(2)(d)] suggests that, in an appropriate case, the agency may wish to provide a summary of the contamination on the site and the remedial solutions that have been identified. From a public health perspective, this may be very useful. The reference to “pathways of exposure” requires a statement that, for example, the contaminant might be of danger if it comes in contact with skin, if breathed, or only if ingested.
      </p>
      <p>
       11. Section 4(b)(4) [§ 55-3004(2)(d)] also suggests that, in an appropriate case, the agency may require the covenant to contain not only a legally sufficient description of the real property subject to the covenant (as mandated under section 4(a)(2)) [§ 55-3004(1)(b)] but also the “location of the contamination.”
    One way of identifying such location is by the concept of “geospatial” location as defined by the Federal Geographic Data Committee of the U.S. Geological Survey. Such an identification would define the location with geospatial data, which the Committee defines as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Geospatial Data: Information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the Earth. This information may be derived from, among other things, remote sensing, mapping, and surveying technologies. Statistical data may be included in this definition. . ..
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on the nature of the contamination and the size of the parcel subject to the covenant, a description of the “geospatial location” of the contamination and the legal boundary description of the real property parcel on which those contaminants are located may be very different, and the kinds of information required to usefully describe the “location” of the contamination may also differ. As a simple example, it may be appropriate to use grid coordinates and projected elevations below ground level to define the upper and lower levels of a groundwater contamination plume, together with sensing or other data that projects the mobility of that plume over time, in order to accurately provide useful information that a simple metes and bounds description could not convey.
      </p>
      <p>
       12. Subsection (b)(5) [(2)(e)] contemplates that the environmental covenant may impose additional restrictions on amendment or termination beyond those required by this Act. For example, in some circumstances the owner or another party who may have contingent residual liability for further cleanup of the real property subject to the environmental covenant, may seek further restrictions in the covenant to protect against this contingent liability.
      </p>
      <p>
       13. Subsection (c) [(3)] confirms that the agency is under no obligation to approve a particular environmental covenant by signing it. This may be particularly significant in those cases where the agency was unable to secure subordination of prior interests in the real property which is proposed to be subject to the covenant. If a prior security or other interest is not subordinated to the environmental covenant, and then is foreclosed at some later time, under traditional real property law that foreclosure would extinguish or limit an environmental covenant. Since such an outcome is antithetical to the policies underlying this Act, the Act contemplates that the agency may, before agreeing to the covenant, require subordination of these interests. At the time of creation of the environmental covenant, the agency must determine whether the prior interest presents a realistic threat to the covenant’s ability to protect the environment and human health. Section 3 [§ 55-3003] of the Act makes clear that by subordinating its interest, an owner of a prior interest does not change its liability with respect to the property subject to the environmental covenant. Any such liability of a subordinating party would arise by operation of other law and not under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [(3)] contemplates that there are many circumstances that might cause an agency, in the exercise of its regulatory discretion as defined in other law, either to refuse to sign a covenant in the form presented, or to agree to sign it only upon satisfaction of specified conditions. The listing of the following examples is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 1: As a condition of signing the covenant, the agency requires the owner to provide an abstract of title of the property to be subjected to the covenant. If the owner declines to do so, the agency may reasonably be expected to decline to approve the covenant, since it will have insufficient evidence of the priority of its new covenant.
    Example 2: The owner provides the title abstract, which discloses that the property to be subjected to the covenant is presently subject to a first mortgage for $5 million. The agency’s decision to condition its approval on the first lender’s willingness to subordinate to the covenant would plainly be appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example 3: The agency’s policies require that an independent company regularly engaged in the business of monitoring and enforcing environmental covenants on behalf of the agency be named as ‘holder’ in the covenant. The owner’s refusal to agree to such a provision would justify an agency’s refusal to approve the covenant.

        Subsection (a) [(1)], when considered with the common law, makes clear that environmental covenants will be binding not only on the persons who originally negotiate them but also on subsequent owners of the property and others who hold an interest in the property, such as tenants, so long as those owners and others have actual or constructive knowledge of the covenant.

        Recording requirements are an important means by which the law protects ‘bona fide purchasers’ — BFP’s — who acquire property without knowledge of its conditions. Even in the absence of recording a document on the land records, the common law has long held that those who have actual knowledge of the document take title subject to the document. The BFP, on the other hand, is bound at common law only by an instrument affecting the real property to the extent the BFP has constructive knowledge of the document.
    Importantly, a BFP is charged with constructive knowledge of the land records. In some respects, one of the fundamental tensions between traditional real property law and environmental law is the change in this rule, by which environmental law seeks to impose liability on “innocent” purchasers of contaminated property who take without knowledge of the property’s condition and may have no practical means of learning of its condition. To the extent this Act tracks traditional real property practice by requiring recorded covenants, this tension may be considerably lessened.

        Subsection (b) [(2)] and its comments are modeled on Section 4 of the Uniform Conservation Easement Act. One of the Environmental Covenant Act’s basic goals is to remove common law defenses that could impede the use of environmental covenants. This section addresses that goal by comprehensively identifying these defenses and negating their applicability to environmental covenants.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       To be binding on future owners who may not have actual knowledge of the covenant, the Act requires that the covenant comply with all provisions of the Act. Section 8(a) [§ 55-3008(1)] of this Act requires the covenant to be recorded. The Act then states the usual real property rule that a recorded instrument “runs with the land” and binds all who have an interest in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act’s policy supports the enforceability of environmental covenants by precluding applicability of doctrines, including older common law doctrines, that would limit enforcement. That policy is broadly consistent with the Restatement of the Law Third of Property (Servitudes), including §2.6 and chapter 3. For specific doctrines see §§ 2.4 (horizontal privity), 2.5 (benefitted or burdened estates), 2.6 (benefits in gross and third party benefits), 3.2 (touch and concern doctrine), 3.3 (rule against perpetuities), and 3.5 (indirect restraints on alienation).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] provides that an environmental covenant, the benefit of which is held in gross, may be enforced against the grantor or his successors or assigns. By stating that the covenant need not be appurtenant to an interest in real property, it eliminates the requirement in force in some states that the holder of an easement must own an interest in real property (the “dominant estate”) benefitted by the easement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(2) [(2)(b)] also clarifies existing law by providing that a covenant may be enforced by an assignee of the holder. Section 10(c) [§ 55-3010(3)] of this Act specifies that assignment to a new holder will be treated as a modification and Section 10 [§ 55-3010] governs modification of environmental covenants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)] addresses the problem posed by the existing law’s recognition of servitudes that served only a limited number of purposes and that law’s reluctance to approve so-called “novel incidents”. This restrictive view might defeat enforcement of covenants serving the environmental protection ends enumerated in this Act. Accordingly, subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)] establishes that environmental covenants are not unenforceable solely because they do not serve purposes or fall within the categories of easements traditionally recognized at common law or other applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)] deals with a variant of the foregoing problem. Some applicable law recognizes only a limited number of “negative easements” — those preventing the owner of the burdened real property from performing acts on his real property that he would be privileged to perform absent the easement. Because a far wider range of negative burdens might be imposed by environmental covenants, subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)] modifies existing law by eliminating the defense that an environmental covenant imposes a “novel” negative burden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(5) [(2)(e)] addresses the opposite problem — the potential unenforceability under existing law of an easement that imposes affirmative obligations upon either the owner of the burdened real property or upon the holder. Under some existing law, neither of those interests was viewed as a true easement at all. The first, in fact, was labeled a “spurious” easement because it obligated an owner of the burdened real property to perform affirmative acts. (The spurious easement was distinguished from an affirmative easement, illustrated by a right of way, which empowered the easement’s holder to perform acts on the burdened real property that the holder would not have been privileged to perform absent the easement.)
    Achievement of environmental protection goals may require that affirmative obligations be imposed on the burdened real property owner or on the covenant holder or both. For example, the grantor of an environmental covenant may agree to use restrictions and may also agree to undertake affirmative monitoring or maintenance obligations. In addition, the covenant might impose specific engineering or monitoring obligations on the holder, which may be a for profit corporation, a charitable corporation or trust holder. In all these cases, the environmental covenant would impose affirmative obligations and Subsection (b)(5) [(2)(e)] makes clear that the covenant would not be unenforceable solely because it is affirmative in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (b)(6) and (b)(7) [(2)(f) and (2)(g)] preclude the touch and concern and privity of estate or contract defenses, respectively. They have traditionally been asserted as defenses against the enforcement of covenants and equitable servitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(8) [(2)(h)] addresses the possibility that the holder may have died or for other reason fails to exist. Failure of the holder ought not invalidate the covenant and Sections 10(c) and (d) [§ 55-3010(3) and (4)] authorize replacement of a holder in various circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(9) [(2)(i)] addresses the case where an owner of a contaminated parcel may agree to remedy an existing condition and may further agree to serve as holder in order to perform the necessary tasks. Under this Act, the owner may be willing to do so because Section 4 [§ 55-3004] of the Act requires that a holder be named and the owner may not be inclined to create an interest in a stranger. Under these circumstances, the owner’s name would appear as both the grantor and the grantee in the land records, and this outcome ought not invalidate the covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [(2)] identifies the principal common law doctrines that have been applied to defeat covenants such as those created by this Act. Drafters in individual states may wish to consider whether references to other common law or statutory impediments of a similar nature ought to be added to this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [(3)] addresses the treatment of instruments recorded before the date of this Act that seek to accomplish the purposes of environmental covenants under this Act. It seeks to validate such instruments, in a limited way, by specifying that the defenses covered in subsection (b) [(2)], or the fact that the instrument was identified as something other than an environmental covenant, will not make prior covenants unenforceable. Beyond negating these specific defenses, however, this Act does not apply to those prior covenants. If the parties to a prior covenant wish to have the other benefits of this Act for that covenant, they must re-execute the covenant in a manner which satisfies the requirements of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section (d) [(4)] is a general savings clause for other interests in real property and other agreements concerning environmental remediation which are not covered under this Act. It disavows the intent to invalidate any interest created either before or after the Act which does not comply with the Act but which otherwise may be valid under the state’s law. Nor does the Act intend, in any way, to validate or invalidate an action taken by a person to remediate contamination that is taken without formal governmental oversight or approval. A recorded instrument that does not satisfy the requirements of this Act does not come within the scope of this Act; it does not enjoy the protections of this Act and must be evaluated under other law of the state.
    For example, the Act is clear that its requirements apply only to land use restrictions placed on real property pursuant to an “environmental response project” as that term is defined in the Act. If private parties choose to use conventional deed restrictions or other devices to place further activity and use restrictions on a parcel, nothing in this Act would affect that contractual arrangement either to insulate it from attack as invalid under that state’s other law or to invalidate it under this law.

       This section clarifies that this Act does not displace other restrictions on land use laws, including zoning laws, building codes, sanitary sewer or subdivision requirements and the like. Restrictions under those laws apply unchanged to real property covered by an environmental covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where other law, including either a state or federal environmental response project, requires structures or activities in order to perform the environmental remediation, the status of those requirements is likely to be determined by that other law and not by this Act. Thus, for example, where the environmental covenant is implementing an environmental response project under federal CERCLA law, a federal appellate court has held that the federal law authorizing the environmental response project preempts a conflicting city ordinance.
    U.S. v. City and County of Denver,
    100 F.3d 1509 (10th Cir. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, the large and complex body of zoning and land use law and the law of environmental regulation supplement the provisions of this Act. In appropriate cases, a court will be called upon to articulate the interrelationship of this Act and those laws, and the Act does not attempted to articulate all those outcomes. On the other hand, certain obvious examples may be helpful in understanding this interplay.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the Act contemplates that an environmental covenant might, for example, prohibit residential use on a parcel subject to a covenant. Under conventional real property principles, without references to this Act, such a prohibition or restriction in an environmental covenant will be valid even if other real property law, including local zoning, would authorize the use for residential purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, a covenant might, at the time it is recorded, permit both retail use and industrial use on a vacant parcel of contaminated real property while prohibiting residential use. Assuming all retail and industrial uses were permitted by local zoning at the time the covenant is recorded, the municipality might, before construction begins, change that zoning to bar industrial use. If such a zone change is otherwise valid under state law, nothing in this Act would affect the municipality’s ability to “down zone” the parcel.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, on the other hand, an industrial use was existing and ongoing at the time the covenant was recorded, and an effort was then made to prohibit that use by ordinance, such state law doctrines as “vested rights” or non-conforming uses, rather than this Act, would govern the validity of the zoning action.

       This section contemplates that the agency will normally require that the final signed environmental covenant be sent to affected parties. In addition to the obvious persons who should be notified, in an appropriate case, the agency might require notice to abutting property owners. These persons are likely to have been directly involved in any major administrative proceeding, but in other cases, such as a voluntary clean-up, they may have no knowledge of the existing conditions on abutting land.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the extent and manner of giving notice rests in the discretion of the agency, and the statute imposes an affirmative duty on the persons required to provide that notice to comply.

      <p>
       Subsection (b) [(2)] provides that failure to provide a copy of the covenant does not invalidate the covenant. Such a failure will not prevent the covenant from protecting human health and the environment and thus need not invalidate the covenant. The remedy for such a failure would be provided by other law.

       Subsection (a) [(1)] confirms that customary indexing rules apply to the covenant. Since the owner is granting the enforcement right to a holder, all the owners’ names would appear in the grantor index and the holder’s name would appear in the grantee index.
      </p>
      <p>
       In those states where a tract or another recording system other than a grantor/grantee index is used, this section should be revised as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act assumes that all parties will wish to record the environmental covenant and accordingly makes the state’s recording rules apply. As between the parties, however, the effectiveness of the covenant does not depend on whether the covenant is recorded. A signed but unrecorded covenant, under traditional real property law, binds the parties who sign it and, generally, those who have knowledge of the covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act makes clear that, as with all recorded instruments, an environmental covenant takes priority under the normal rules of “First in time, First in Right.”
    See
    The Restatement of The Law Third Property — Mortgages §§ 7.1 and 7.3. In that sense, the covenant does not enjoy the same priority afforded real property tax liens, because of the substantial constitutional impediment such a change in priority would likely create.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the Act departs in important ways from the consequences of the normal priority and other traditional rules. For example, under Section 9 [§ 55-3009], foreclosure of a tax lien cannot extinguish an environmental covenant.
    See
    Section 9(c) [§ 55-3009(3)].
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, in those cases where the holder’s interest is transferred to a successor holder, the assignment of that interest will be recorded, and the usual grantor/grantee indexing rules would apply. Note, however, that under Section 10(d) [§ 55-3010(4)], the assignment would be treated as an amendment of the covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recording of an environmental covenant pursuant to the law of this state provides the same constructive notice of the covenant as the recording or any other instrument provides of an interest in real property.

        Subject to the other provisions in this Act, environmental covenants are intended to be perpetual, as provided in subsection (a) [(1)]. A covenant may be limited by its terms as provided in this Section, or amended or terminated under Section 10 [§ 55-3010]. Alternatively, in the limited circumstances described in this Section it may be modified in an eminent domain proceeding which meets the requirements of Subsection (a)(5) [(1)(e)]. With concurrence of the agency, an environmental covenant may also be terminated in a judicial proceeding asserting “changed circumstances” as provided in Subsection (b) [(2)].

        Subsection (a)(5) [(1)(e)] provides special requirements to modify or terminate an environmental covenant by an exercise of eminent domain. The rationale for these special requirements is that an exercise of eminent domain may result in a change of use for real property. Such a change must ensure that it does not increase environmental risk related to the real property.
    The Act does not attempt to resolve all the many complex issues likely to arise when one government agency seeks to condemn an environmental covenant imposed by another agency pursuant to an agreement with a current or former owner of the property. For example, eminent domain may result in a change of use of that property. If the changed use requires termination of the covenant’s existing activity and use limitations, and thus additional clean-up of the property, complex questions of liability and financial responsibility may arise. Alternatively, state law may already address questions of which governments have or do not have authority to condemn real property, or who are necessary or indispensable parties. State statutes are also likely to have so-called “quick take” provisions, a well-developed Administrative Procedures Act, and other important provisions for aspects of condemnation proceedings beyond the scope of this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3009-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol13">
        Subsection (b) [(2)] imposes two specific requirements for a judicial change in an environmental covenant under the doctrine of changed circumstances. The first requires agency approval of such an application. The second requires that all parties to the covenant be given notice of the proceeding. This will allow those parties to protect their interests in the proceeding, including their interests arising from contingent future liability.
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3009-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol14">
        Subsection (c) [(3)] provides that environmental covenants are not extinguished by later tax foreclosure sales, or by a range of potential common law and statutory impairments. As a matter of public policy, these new forms of covenants seek to protect human health and the environment and, presumably, the contamination of the real property that led to the activity and use limitations would still be present if the covenant were extinguished. Accordingly, the impairment of those limitations as a consequence of application of tax lien foreclosure or other doctrines would likely result in greater exposure to health risk. Thus termination of that protection to serve other public policies of governments seems inconsistent.

        While this section imposes statutory constraints on the authority of the court to act in the first instance, the Act does not restrict application of other procedural and administrative law to judicial supervision of agency conduct. Thus, if a court were to determine that an agency has acted in violation of its statutory obligations in considering whether to approve a modification or termination of an environmental covenant, that conduct would be itself be subject to judicial scrutiny under other law of that state.
    Where an environmental covenant applies to real property that is otherwise subject to one of the doctrines listed in Subsection (c) [(3)], circumstances may arise in which the protections of the covenant are not needed. For example, rights gained by adverse possession would be limited by the environmental covenant’s restrictions where a house had been inadvertently placed on real property subject to an environmental covenant that precluded residential use. In a case such as these, modification of the covenant can be sought pursuant to Section 10 [§ 55-3010]. Seeking such a modification will ensure that appropriate consideration will be given to residual environmental risks.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Section 9(a)(5) [§ 55-3009(1)(e)] has specific requirements for an exercise of eminent domain that modifies or terminates an environmental covenant. The applicability of this Act’s eminent domain requirements to an eminent domain action under federal law will be determined by that law.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if the eminent domain proceeding were to go forward without the need to terminate or amend the environmental covenant, the existing covenant would remain in place and then the approval required by this subsection of the Act would not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act intends that a court, in considering this section, would apply the doctrine of changed circumstances in its traditional sense — that is, as a proposed modification of the covenant to reduce or eliminate its burden. This section does not provide a substitute procedure for modifying a covenant to increase the burden on the real property. Such an outcome would be antithetical to the careful balancing of interests embedded in the Act. It would also be inconsistent with the expectations of owners and legally liable parties who have entered into the covenant with an expectation that the burden would not be increased except pursuant to the procedures set out in this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, to avoid any suggestion of impairment of contract, the Act confirms that prior mortgages and other lien holders, upon foreclosure, may extinguish a subsequent covenant that was not subordinated. The lien holder in that case, of course, would still be faced with the physical condition of the property and the agency would have whatever regulations and rights against such an owner that state and federal law afforded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic policy of this Act to ensure that environmental covenants survive impairment is consistent with the broad policy articulated in the Restatement of the Law of Property (Servitudes) Third, §7.9.

       <p>
        Note: Idaho did not adopt the optional subsection (4) in the uniform act.
       </p>
       <p>
        States that do not have a Marketable Record Title Act or a Dominant Mineral Interests Act will not need subsection (d). States that do have either or both of these acts may choose to put this exception in the respective statute rather than in this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The exception to the Marketable Record Title Act and the Dormant Mineral Interests Act in optional (d) is analogous to exceptions commonly made for conservation and preservation servitudes. Restatement of the Law of Property Third (Servitudes) § 7.16(5) (1998). It is based on the public importance of ensuring continued enforcement of environmental covenants to protect human health and the environment. For states adopting the registry of environmental covenants to be kept by the [insert name of state regulatory agency for environmental protection] under Section 12 of this Act, the cost of extending title searches to this registry should be low.
       </p>
       <p>
        If there is any question whether a specific environmental covenant is exempt from the requirements of the Marketable Record Title Act or the Dominant Mineral Interests Act, the agency should comply with that Act by re-recording the covenant within the relevant act’s specified statutory period. This will ensure that the covenant is not extinguished under either of these acts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the fact that the Act specifies that notice of either an eminent domain proceeding or an action to apply the doctrine of changed circumstances be given to persons identified in Section 10 does not mean that other persons might not also be entitled to notice of the action or to intervene as parties in the action under other legal principles. Other state law may require such notice and this Act does not affect such other, additional notice requirements.

     <p>
        A variety of circumstances may lead the parties to wish to amend an environmental covenant to change its activity and use limitations or to terminate the covenant.
     </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) [(1)] specifies the parties that must consent to the amendment. Subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)] reaches a party that originally signed the covenant whether or not it was an owner of the real property. Such parties might typically be ones which were liable for some or all of the environmental remediation specified in the environmental response project, including contingent liability for future remediation. This provision is intended to apply to successors in interest to the party which originally signed the covenant where the successor continues to be subject to the contingent liability under the environmental response project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the original parties to the covenant may have signed the covenant because they have contingent liability for future remediation should it become necessary. The extension of that liability to successor businesses is a complex subject controlled by the underlying state or federal environmental law creating the liability. See Blumberg, Strasser and Fowler,
    The Law of Corporate Groups: Statutory Law, 2002 Annual Supplement,
    § 18.02 and § 18.02.4 (Aspen, 2002) and Blumberg and Strasser, The Law of Corporate Groups: Statutory Law-State §§ 15.03.2 and 15.03.3 (Aspen, 1995). Where the party that originally signed the covenant has been merged into or otherwise become part of another business entity for purposes of future cleanup liability, subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)] is intended to require the consent of that successor entity rather than the consent of the original party.
    2. In considering the potential liability of successor businesses, as discussed above, it is important to understand the dual chains of successors that a particular circumstance presents — (1) successors to ownership of the business that originally caused the contamination; and (2) successors to owners of the contaminated real property. Particularly when contamination occurred many years ago, those chains of successors may be very different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this hypothetical — although very typical — situation:
      </p>
      <div>
       <h5 id="t55c30s55-3010-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXT-realpropertyownership">
        Real Property Ownership.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In 1950, Peter Plating closed its Hartford plating operation, and sold the land and factory to Rabbit Warehouses, Inc. Rabbit used the factory for 25 years as a storage facility, and then sold the factory in 1975 to Ernie Entrepreneur, an individual, who bought the land with the proceeds of a first mortgage from First Local Bank.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ernie used the factory for light manufacturing until 1985. He also leased part of the site to Acme Auto Repair, Inc. Acme dumped used oil and degreasers into its own sump on the lot. At some unknown date, Acme ceased operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1985, after Ernie learned of the contamination, he transferred ownership of the land to a corporation — Ernie, Inc. Ernie and his wife owned all the stock of the new corporation. In 1986, Ernie ceased operations, abandoned the factory, and moved with his family to an island off North Carolina. Ernie, Inc. was later administratively dissolved under state law for failure to file its annual reports.
       </p>
       <p>
        First Local Bank started foreclosure in 1986, learned of the contamination, and withdrew the foreclosure action because of its reluctance to be in the chain of title. The Bank still holds the mortgage, but long ago wrote off the debt on its books.
       </p>
       <p>
        Real property taxes have not been paid since 1984. City officials started to foreclose for unpaid taxes, but when they learned of the contamination, they, like First Local Bank, decided not to foreclose.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2002, the City demolished the factory as a safety measure, put a fence around it and put a $200,000 demolition lien on the property. Today, the site is abandoned, and neighborhood children play games on the lot after crawling under the fence. Clean-up costs are estimated at $1.6 million; a “clean” 1.5-acre lot in this run-down neighborhood recently sold for $50,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        The traditional “chain of title” doctrine in real property suggests that successive owners and operators of the real property, beginning with the original owner or tenant that caused contamination of the real property, may all have potential liability. In chronological order, they include: (1) Peter Plating, Inc.; (2) Rabbit Warehousing, Inc. (3) Ernie Entrepreneur, individually; (4) Acme Auto Repair, Inc.; and (5) Ernie, Inc.
       </p>

       </h5>
       <p>
        Assume this Act had been in effect in 1940, and Peter Plating, Inc. had signed the original environmental covenant. If the agency wishes in 2003 to amend the 1940 covenant, it will be important to determine who must sign on behalf of Peter Plating — the person who originally signed the covenant in 1940 — as required by subsection 10(a)(3) [(1)(c)].
       </p>
       <p>
        3. Note also that Ernie, Inc. — the current owner — has abandoned the property and moved out of state. Neither this corporation nor Ernie Entrepreneur, as an individual, is likely to cooperate in signing a new covenant today or an amendment to an original covenant that was signed in 1940. This may pose practical difficulties in satisfying the requirements of Section 10(a)(2) [§ 55-3010(1)(b)].
       </p>
       <p>
        4. In order to secure the consents required by this section, it is likely that the agency will require the party seeking the amendment to provide notice to the parties whose consent is required by the statute.
       </p>
       <p>
        5. Note that this section does not require the consent of intermediate owners of the real property — in our example, if the original owner in 1940 was Peter Plating, and the current owner is Ernie, Inc., then Rabbit Warehouses, Inc., would not be required to approve an amendment to the covenant. Rabbit would have been bound by the covenant when it bought the parcel in 1975. Since there is no allegation that Rabbit took any action in violation of the covenant, and Rabbit conveyed the property to Ernie without retention of any interest in the property, Rabbit would not be affected by the covenant and therefore need not sign the amendment.
       </p>
       <p>
        6. Finally, the covenant may be amended or terminated with respect only to a portion of the real property that was originally subject to the covenant. Thus, for example, if a covenant originally covered 100 acres of real property and as a result of remediation activity, 50 acres of the site eventually became completely free of contamination and pose no further environmental risk, the parties might agree to terminate the activity and use limitations on the cleaned up 50 acres while leaving the covenant in place on the remaining land.
       </p>
       <p>
        7. As provided in Section 11(b) [§ 55-3011(2)], this Act does not limit the agency’s regulatory authority under other law to regulate an environmental response project and the agency may be well advised to consider the implication of this provision in drafting a specific environmental covenant. Thus, for example, if new science suggested a need for additional monitoring or remediation at a contaminated site beyond that mandated in a recorded environmental covenant applicable to that site, the agency’s authority to require that additional work would depend on other law, while its authority to impose the remediation cost on other parties may depend both on that law and on the terms of any prior agreements the agency may have executed with potentially liable parties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this Act, however, the agency would be prevented from administratively releasing or amending real property covenants without approval of the parties designated in this section. Given the potential legal liability of the parties in the two chains of title who may be affected by an amendment to or termination of the covenant, this is an appropriate outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, over time, it may not be practical to identify the original parties or their corporate successors in order to secure their consent. Section 10(a)(3) [§ 55-3010(1)(c)] provides a judicial mechanism by which the need for absent parties’ consent may be avoided.
       </p>
       <p>
        The same section highlights the possibility that the agency might seek the agreement of the original parties to future amendments of the covenant, without the need for later consent. Such a waiver might be attractive to original parties, depending on the extent to which the agency was willing to hold original parties harmless from the liability that might otherwise accrue from a claimed injury following a use once prohibited by the original covenant, and depending also on the overall cost of the transaction.
    Where there is a change in either the current knowledge of remaining contamination or the current understanding of the environmental risks it presents, the agency may conclude that the environmental response project should be changed or new regulatory action taken. The agency’s ability to take such action is contemplated by § 11(b) [§ 55-3011(2)] but, in the absence of consent, is not governed by this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agency may wish to consider whether the following parties have a sufficient interest in a particular proposal to make notice of the proposed amendment to them advisable:
       </p>

        The Act does not authorize any claims for damages, restitution, court costs, attorneys’ fees or other such awards. Standing to bring such claims, and the bases for any such cause of action, must be found, if at all, under other law. At the same time, while this action does not authorize any such cause of action, it does not bar them if available under other law.

      </ol>
      <p>
       This Act confers standing to enforce an environmental covenant on persons other than the agency and other parties to the covenant because of the important policies underlying compliance with the terms of the covenant. Thus, for example, in the case of a covenant approved by a federal agency on real property which has been conveyed out of federal ownership, the Act confers standing on a state agency to enforce the covenant, even though the agency may not have signed it. Further, a local affected government is empowered to seek injunctive relief to enforce a covenant to which it may not be a party. In both cases, absent this Act, those state and municipal agencies might not have standing to enforce a covenant, and might simply be relegated to seeking standing under other law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the mandated ‘holder’ has a statutory right to enforce the covenant under this section, since the holder must be a party to the covenant. Over time, the holder may come to play a significant role in the monitoring and enforcement process.
    On the other hand, the Act does not provide any authority for a citizens’ suit to enforce a covenant, although other law may authorize such suits. This Act does not affect that other law.

        This section should be used only by states that require creation of a registry of environmental covenants pursuant to this optional Section. At the time this Act was promulgated, Section 101 of CERCLA had recently been amended to encourage states to create registries of sites where remediation work had been completed; see Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, Pub. L. No. 107-118 § 128(b)(1)(C) (2002). The Act anticipates that in those states that choose to create such a registry for federal law purposes, this section would prove useful in integrating local land recording systems with a single, state-wide registry.
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3012-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol12">
        The notice specified in this Section may be recorded in the land records in lieu of recording the environmental covenant. However, such a notice should be authorized only if the registry is established and the environmental covenant is recorded there. Where there is no separate registry, the environmental covenant must be recorded in the land records and this notice would not be used.
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3012-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol13">
        A description of the property under subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] may include identification by latitude/longitude coordinates. Note also that a description of the location of the contamination itself on the site may require considerably more detail than the description of the real property subject to the covenant; see the discussion of this subject in the comments to Section 4 [§ 55-3004].
       </li>
       <li id="t55c30s55-3012-COMMENTTOOFFICIALTEXTol14">
        The web address required to be contained in the notice by subsection (c)(7) [requirement not adopted by Idaho] should reflect the most direct means of identifying the full covenant and accompanying information. As appropriate, the address may require a specific internet address, page or name reference, document number of other unique identifying name, number or symbol.

       A registry created under this optional section could be self-funding, in the same way that the corporate records departments of most Secretaries of State offices and the land recording offices of most counties and municipalities are self-funding.
