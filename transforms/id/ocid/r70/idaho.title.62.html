      The Idaho transportation department shall follow federal guidelines on such grade crossing improvement projects as are to be funded in whole or in part under any federal act, and where the project is not funded entirely by federal funds, the Idaho transportation department may use moneys in the railroad grade crossing protection fund to pay all or a portion of the matching funds required.
     </p>
     <p>
      On projects where federal-aid funds are not being utilized in whole or in part, the Idaho transportation department shall apportion the entire cost of the engineering, installation, reconstruction or improvement of any signal or device as described in section 62-304A, Idaho Code, between the railroad company or companies and the Idaho transportation department or the local authority, in proportion to the respective benefits to be derived. The Idaho transportation department may use moneys in the railroad grade crossing protection fund to pay all or a portion of the cost apportioned to the Idaho transportation department or local authority involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      The railroad company or companies owning the track or tracks upon which the improvement shall be made shall perform all construction and maintenance of the signals or devices and shall be reimbursed for such part of said costs not to be borne by it, but in allocating said costs and dividing the same among the parties involved, the Idaho transportation department shall limit the amount to be charged against the railroad company or companies to a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the total cost of such construction, unless the crossing is a new one proposed by the railroad company or companies, in which case the entire cost of construction shall be apportioned to said railroad company or companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon application to the Idaho transportation department, and with the approval of the Idaho transportation board, a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) annually may be provided from the railroad grade crossing protection fund to support public education and safety programs which promote awareness of public safety at railroad grade crossings of public streets, roads or highways over the tracks of any railroad company or companies.

     <p>
      In its administration of the railroad grade crossing protection account, the Idaho transportation department shall establish a priority rating for railroad crossings, assigning priority first to the most hazardous railroad crossing locations, giving proper weight to traffic volume over such crossings by school buses and vehicles transporting dangerous commodities and if the Idaho transportation department determines from all of the evidence that public safety does not require installation of protective signals or devices at a crossing under consideration, it may refuse to order the installation of signals or devices or may defer their installation until more hazardous crossings have been protected. Every railroad company shall file with the Idaho transportation department a copy of each report of accident which is filed with the Idaho public utilities commission pursuant to the provisions of section 61-517, Idaho Code, for the Idaho transportation department to consider in making its determination. No part of any report filed with the Idaho transportation department as required in this section, or of any record, or a copy thereof, of any hearing held under the provisions of this act or of the determination provided for in this section and no finding, conclusion or order made by the Idaho transportation department in the administration of this act shall be used as evidence in any trial, civil or criminal, arising out of an accident at or in the vicinity of any crossing prior to installation of signals or other warning devices pursuant to an order of the Idaho transportation department as a result of any such investigation or proceeding.

      Wherever and whenever the location of any state highway, or other public street, road or highway, has been or shall be changed, the result of which has changed or will change the location of the place where such street, road or highway crosses any railroad tracks at grade, and a new crossing at grade or an overpass or underpass has been or shall be constructed at such new location, or whenever the closing and abandonment of an existing crossing is in the interest of and reasonably necessary for the public safety, or an existing crossing is no longer reasonably necessary as a public crossing for any reason, then the old grade crossing shall be deemed to be unnecessary and may be eliminated and discontinued. In the event any objection be made to the elimination and discontinuance of said old grade crossing, the Idaho transportation board or the owners, operators, or lessees of any such railroad, or both, may, upon the completion and placing in operation of said new grade crossing, overpass or underpass, or whenever for any other reason a crossing is to be closed and abandoned, the public authority having jurisdiction over the street, road or highway, or the owners, operators, or lessees of any such railroad, or both, shall petition the public utilities commission for an order eliminating and discontinuing said old grade crossing, whether said change of location has been made or construction of an underpass or overpass completed before or after the passage of this act, and said commission shall be and is hereby authorized and empowered to hear and determine said petition in accordance with the provisions of chapters 1 to 7, inclusive, title 61, Idaho Code, and if upon hearing duly had it shall find and determine that the closing and abandonment of such grade crossing is in the interest of, and reasonably necessary for the public safety, or that said crossing is no longer reasonably needed, it shall make an order authorizing the closing and abandonment of said crossing. Any order made by the commission concerning said matter shall be enforceable and subject to review in the same manner as other orders of the commission. Upon any order of closing and abandonment becoming final, said grade crossing may be closed either by the public authority having jurisdiction over the street, road or highway or by the owner, operator or lessee of such railroad.

        This section is a general police regulation, designed not merely for the benefit of the adjoining owners, but for the protection of property in domestic animals generally and for safety of passengers who would be exposed to peril by collision with cattle coming upon the track; thus, the company is under general obligation to the public and not limited obligation to adjoining landowners. Johnson v. Oregon S. L. R.R., 7 Idaho 355, 63 P. 112 (1900). Inclosed Lands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory test of “inclosed” lands does not require a fence or wall, but presumptively may be met by something else which works as a barrier to turn cattle. Darrar v. Chicago, M., St. P. & Pac. R.R., 94 Idaho 772, 497 P.2d 1399 (1972).

        Evidence that a railroad passed along the south side of a pasture which was enclosed by fences on the west and east ends, except for a point where a road cut through, and on the north side by a mountainous terrain with timber growth through which cattle did not roam was sufficient to support a finding that the railroad passed along an enclosed pasture within the meaning of the statute. Darrar v. Chicago, M., St. P. & Pac. R.R., 94 Idaho 772, 497 P.2d 1399 (1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        While railroad is held to strict compliance with requirements as to fences at designated points, it is only fair to require claimant to show that lands which he claims are required to be fenced are in such condition and so situated as to make railroad company liable.

       <p>
        Evidence that the railroad’s right of way fence was in such poorly maintained condition that cattle were not turned, and that the fence was down at the times cattle were killed was sufficient for the district court to have found the railroad liable under this section.

       <p>
        This section requires every railroad company to erect and maintain fences, with gates at private crossings, at places where it is required to fence, which gates so maintained shall be kept closed by the railroad company, as far as third parties and the public are concerned. Saccamonno v. Great N. Ry., 30 Idaho 513, 166 P. 267 (1917); Mole v. Mellon, 46 Idaho 450, 268 P. 1048 (1928).

      Every railroad company must keep a book at a principal station in each county into or through which its road runs, to be designated by the company, and a notice of the station so designated must be filed with the recorder of the county in which the station is located; and every such company must cause to be entered in said book, within fifteen (15) days after the killing or maiming of any animal, a description as nearly as may be of such animal, its color, age, marks and brands, and keep said book subject to public inspection. Should any company fail to keep such book, or to file such notice in the manner herein provided, or to enter therein such description of any animal maimed or killed, for a period of fifteen (15) days thereafter, such company is liable to the owner of such animal for twice the value thereof.

      In case of maiming or killing any cattle, sheep or hog, the body of the animal belongs to the company, unless the owner elects, within twelve (12) hours, to take the same in satisfaction or reduction of damages. The company may proceed to take care of and preserve the body of such animal, and must unless taken by the owner, take off enough of the hide to show distinctly any brands on such animal, also both ears, including the hide between the ears, and in such way as to keep the ears together, and the pieces of hide so taken off, and the ears of each animal, must be attached together and preserved for at least three (3) months for inspection at the station house nearest to the place where such killing or maiming occurred. For every failure so to keep any such pieces of hide and ears for inspection, the company, in addition to the damages to the owner, forfeits $100, to be recovered in an action in the name of the state, in any court of competent jurisdiction, one-half to be paid into the school fund of the county, and the residue to the informer.

        In negligence action resulting from collision between train and automobile, there was no violation of this section because train’s signal horn was blown 50% or less of the time from the first sounding. The statute only requires that the horn be sounded at intervals, and in this case the train crew activated the bell on the lead locomotive as well as sounding the horn. Hayes v. Union Pac. R.R.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t62c06s62-602ol11">
       The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby finds that universally available telecommunications services are essential to the health, welfare and economic well-being of the citizens of the state of Idaho and there is a need for establishing legislation to protect and maintain high-quality universal telecommunications at just and reasonable rates for all classes of customers and to encourage innovation within the industry by a balanced program of regulation and competition.
      </li>
      <li id="t62c06s62-602ol12">
       It is the intent of this legislature that effective competition throughout a local exchange calling area will involve a significant number of customers having both service provider and service option choices and that actual competition means more than the mere presence of a competitor. Instead, for there to be actual and effective competition there needs to be substantive and meaningful competition throughout the incumbent telephone corporation’s local exchange calling area.
      </li>
      <li id="t62c06s62-602ol13">
       It is the further intent of the legislature that the commission, in its deliberation of deregulation of the incumbent telephone corporations, will examine the impact such deregulation will have on the public interest in accordance with the general grant of authority given to the commission by the legislature and that all parties be allowed to comment thereon in such proceeding.
      </li>
      <li id="t62c06s62-602ol14">
       The legislature further finds that the telecommunications industry is in a state of transition from a regulated public utility industry to a competitive industry. The legislature encourages the development of open competition in the telecommunications industry in accordance with provisions of Idaho law and consistent with the federal telecommunications act of 1996.
      </li>
      <li id="t62c06s62-602ol15">
       The commission shall administer these statutes with respect to telecommunication rates and services in accordance with these policies and applicable federal law.
      </li>
      <li id="t62c06s62-602ol16">
       The legislature further finds that it is consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity that the obligation of certain rural telephone companies to comply with the requirements of section 251(c) of the telecommunications act of 1996 should be suspended upon petition of the affected telephone company, based upon the following legislative findings that the suspension is necessary:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t62c06s62-602ol16a">
         To avoid a significant economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally in areas served by the rural telephone companies;

     <ol>
      <li id="t62c06s62-622ol11">
       The commission shall regulate the prices for basic local exchange services for incumbent telephone corporations in accordance with the following provisions:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t62c06s62-622ol11a">
         At the request of the incumbent telephone corporation, the commission shall establish maximum just and reasonable rates for basic local exchange service. Maximum basic local exchange rates shall be sufficient to recover the costs incurred to provide the services. Costs shall include authorized depreciation, a reasonable portion of shared and common costs, and a reasonable profit. Authorized depreciation lives shall use forward-looking competitive market lives. Authorized depreciation lives shall be applied prospectively and to undepreciated balances.
        </li>
        <li id="t62c06s62-622ol11b">
         At the request of the telephone corporation, the commission may find that existing rates for local services constitute the maximum rates.
        </li>
        <li id="t62c06s62-622ol11c">
         The commission shall issue its order establishing maximum rates no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the filing of the request unless the telephone corporation consents to a longer period.
        </li>
        <li id="t62c06s62-622ol11d">
         An incumbent telephone corporation may charge prices lower than the maximum basic local exchange rates established by the commission. Provided however, upon the petition of a nonincumbent telephone corporation, the commission shall establish a minimum price for the incumbent telephone corporation’s basic local exchange service if the commission finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the incumbent telephone corporation’s prices for basic local exchange services in the local exchange area are below the incumbent telephone corporation’s average variable cost of providing such services.
        </li>
        <li id="t62c06s62-622ol11e">
         After the commission has established maximum basic local exchange rates, an incumbent telephone corporation may change its tariffs or price lists reflecting the availability, price, terms and conditions for local exchange service effective not less than ten (10) days after filing with the commission and giving notice to affected customers. Changes to tariffs or price lists that are for nonrecurring services and that are quoted directly to the customer when an order for service is placed, or changes that result in price reductions or new service offerings, shall be effective immediately upon filing with the commission and no other notice shall be required.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t62c06s62-622ol12">
       The commission shall not regulate the prices for basic local exchange services for telephone corporations that were not providing such local service on or before February 8, 1996. Provided however, such telephone corporation providing basic local exchange services shall file price lists with the commission that reflect the availability, price, terms and conditions for such services. Changes to such price lists shall be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing with the commission and giving notice to affected customers. Changes to price lists that are for nonrecurring services and that are quoted directly to the customer when an order for service is placed, or changes that result in price reductions or new service offerings, shall be effective immediately upon filing with the commission and no other notice shall be required. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection and subsection (1) of this section, telephone corporations that are subject to the provisions of this subsection shall not be required to file tariffs or price lists for basic local exchange services provided to business customers.

       The commission shall cease regulating basic local exchange rates in a local exchange calling area upon a showing by an incumbent telephone corporation that effective competition exists for basic local exchange service throughout the local exchange calling area.

        <li id="t62c06s62-622ol13a">

       The commission shall determine the noneconomic regulatory requirements for all telephone corporations providing basic local exchange service or designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier pursuant to sections 62-610A through 62-610F, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to, such matters as service quality standards, provision of access to carriers providing message telecommunications service, filing of price lists, customer notice and customer relation rules.

     <p>
      Upon written notice to the commission and to its business customers, and after posting the rates, terms and conditions of its services on the carrier’s public website, a telephone corporation may withdraw any tariff or price list not required to be filed under the provisions of this section, provided:
    (a) The carrier continues to maintain the rates, terms and conditions of its services on the company’s public website;

        It is the purpose of this chapter, among other things, to require cooperation on the part of telegraph and telephone companies in the transmission of messages and communications to or from any place where the use of both means of communication is necessary or desirable and where such use will expedite the transmission of any such message or communication; and it shall be unlawful for any telegraph or telephone company or any person having charge of any public telegraph or telephone service or system, controlling or operating any such system within this state, in whole or in part, or any employee thereof, to transmit any message or communication upon which the fees and charges have been paid, tendered or offered, as herein provided, by mail, over any portion of the distance over which such message or communication is to be transmitted, unless neither telegraph nor telephone service is available, and then such means of transmission shall only be used for such distance as necessary in conveying such message to the nearest telegraph or telephone station.

       <p>
        Telegraph company is public service corporation engaged in public utility, and in receiving, transmitting and delivering messages should be treated as an independent principal or contracting party, and be held liable in contract and tort, the same as other principals. Strong v. Western Union Tel. Co., 18 Idaho 389, 109 P. 910 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reasonableness or unreasonableness of rules and regulations made by a telegraph company must be determined with reference to public policy, precisely as in the case of common carriers, and a stipulation which exempts such company from damages for its own negligence is void. Strong v. Western Union Tel. Co., 18 Idaho 389, 109 P. 910 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a telegraph company fails to transmit a message correctly, the proof of the fact is prima facie evidence of the company’s negligence. Strong v. Western Union Tel. Co., 18 Idaho 389, 109 P. 910 (1910).
