        Formation and Nature of Partnership.

       <p>
        It is not necessary that all co-owners in claim shall be engaged in working it, either together or separately, in order to constitute a mining partnership. Hawkins v. Spokane Hydraulic Mining Co., 3 Idaho 241, 28 P. 433 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parties who acquire a mine for purpose of working it and actually engage in working same comprise a mining partnership although they do not own the same. Haskins v. Curran, 4 Idaho 573, 43 P. 559 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute mining partnership it is essential that co-owners actually engage in working mine or in business of operating it; the cotenancy of two or more persons in a mining claim is not of itself sufficient to constitute such tenants mining partners. Madar v. Norman, 13 Idaho 585, 92 P. 572 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not essential that all tenants join in the working or business of mining in order to establish mining partnership; that relation may be established among such co-owners as have actually engaged in the working or mining operation; those not so engaged will be left to their right and be chargeable by their duties as cotenants only. Madar v. Norman, 13 Idaho 585, 92 P. 572 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mining partnership differs from an ordinary one in that it is formed without any express agreement between the parties and exists from joint ownership in a mine and working the same. One partner may sell his interest without consent of the others, or die, and the partnership is not dissolved. A new owner may purchase an interest in the mine, or inherit it, and he becomes a mining partner in the working thereof. It differs from an ordinary partnership in another respect also, in that the majority in interest have the right to control the method of working and the means to be employed. In these respects and in its continuity, it resembles a private corporation. Albertini v. Hull Lease, 54 Idaho 30, 28 P.2d 205 (1933).

      An express agreement to become partners or to share the profits and losses of mining is not necessary to the formation or existence of a mining partnership. The relation arises from the ownership of shares or interest in the mine and working the same for the purpose of extracting the minerals therefrom.
