       <p>
        Any legislation, which attempts to require courts to admit candidates for bar on standards other than accepted or established by the court, is unconstitutional, as an invasion of the judicial power, and a violation of the constitution establishing separate branches of government.

        The right to practice a profession has been held in this state not to be a property right; it is a privilege or franchise, and the privilege to practice a profession is a valuable one which may only be revoked by the proper exercise of the police power. In re Edwards, 45 Idaho 676, 266 P. 665 (1928); Craft v. Balderston, 58 Idaho 650, 78 P.2d 122 (1938).

        The right to practice law is a privilege and the admission or exclusion of persons from the right is a judicial power. In re Edwards, 45 Idaho 676, 266 P. 665 (1928); In re Lavin, 59 Idaho 197, 81 P.2d 727 (1938).

      If any person shall practice law or hold himself out as qualified to practice law in this state without having been admitted to practice therein by the Supreme Court and without having paid all license fees now or hereafter prescribed by law for the practice of law he is guilty of contempt both in the Supreme Court and district court for the district in which he shall so practice or hold himself out as qualified to practice.

      The measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties, which is not restrained by law. From the commencement of an action, or the service of an answer containing a counterclaim, the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his client’s cause of action or counterclaim, which attaches to a verdict, report, decision or judgment in his client’s favor and the proceeds thereof in whosoever hands they may come; and can not be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment.

        Where defendant served several corporations both as general counsel and general manager, he had no common-law attorney’s lien on the records of such corporations for payment of fees, assuming such liens were not replaced by this section, since his relationship with the corporations was not only as an attorney, but also as general manager of each of them.

        To foreclose a charging lien, an attorney may intervene in the underlying litigation, and the court may conduct ancillary proceedings to reduce the lien to judgment, or the attorney may commence a separate action to reduce the lien to judgment. Both courses require a complaint served on all relevant counsel and parties, summarizing the relevant fee agreement, identifying the nature of the lien and the lien’s creation and attachment, describing the attorney’s work performed and any results obtained, stating the underlying case’s procedural posture, and setting forth a sworn estimate of the amount of the lien, after which the court must find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the attorney’s work produced the res and that the claimed fees are reasonable.

       <p>
        Action of divorce may be continued after condonation of parties for purpose of enforcing lien of attorney for services rendered in suit. Taylor v. Taylor, 33 Idaho 445, 196 P. 211 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where decree did not require husband to pay fees of wife’s attorney, the court could not fix fees of attorneys in the proceeding or place a lien for such fees on real estate in which wife had an interest. Heslip v. Heslip, 74 Idaho 368, 262 P.2d 999 (1953).

        Filing of Claim.

       <p>
        Attorney was not required to file an independent action but could file his claim of attorney’s lien in connection with the principal case. Frazee v. Frazee, 104 Idaho 463, 660 P.2d 928 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attorney may assert a claim of entitlement to a fee and a claim of entitlement to collect the fee from a particular fund in the same case where the client’s action against a third party is adjudicated, unless some prejudice would result from doing so. Knight Ins., Inc. v. Knight, 109 Idaho 56, 704 P.2d 960 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney was not entitled to a lien on funds paid by an insurance company to the insured where the attorney had not filed a claim or counter claim, but settled with the insurance company before filing suit. Kenneth F. White, Chtd. v. St. Alphonsus Reg’l Med. Ctr., 136 Idaho 238, 31 P.3d 926 (Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if an attorney’s appeal of the denial of a motion to perfect an attorney’s lien was not dismissed due to lack of standing, the attorney still would not prevail on the merits; the attorney had not commenced an action or filed a counterclaim. Kinghorn v. Clay, 153 Idaho 462, 283 P.3d 779 (2012).

        Foreclosure of Mortgage.
       </h5>
       <p>
        To foreclose a charging lien, an attorney may intervene in the underlying litigation, and the court may conduct ancillary proceedings to reduce the lien to judgment, or the attorney may commence a separate action to reduce the lien to judgment. Both courses require a complaint served on all relevant counsel and parties, summarizing the relevant fee agreement, identifying the nature of the lien and the lien’s creation and attachment, describing the attorney’s work performed and any results obtained, stating the underlying case’s procedural posture, and setting forth a sworn estimate of the amount of the lien, after which the court must find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the attorney’s work produced the res and that the claimed fees are reasonable. Clark v. Jones Gledhill Fuhrman Gourley, P.A., 163 Idaho 215, 409 P.3d 795 (2017). Foreclosure of Mortgage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The action to foreclose a mortgage given to secure several notes is a separate and distinct action and but one fee can be allowed in such action; the fee to be allowed is the one stipulated by the mortgage to be reasonable. Lewis v. Sutton, 21 Idaho 541, 122 P. 911 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s lien for services in foreclosure suit attached to land after mortgage foreclosure sale and purchase by administratrix, who was judgment creditor and sole legatee, because land became proceeds of judgment. Miller v. Monroe, 50 Idaho 726, 300 P. 362 (1931).

       <p>
        Where law firm sought to enforce attorney’s lien against client, the fact that funds were held by court rather than actually received by the client did not bar enforcement, since this section contemplates that funds available for distribution by judicial order are subject to attorney’s lien. Skelton v. Spencer, 102 Idaho 69, 625 P.2d 1072, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 894, 102 S. Ct. 390, 70 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1981), overruled in part, Kinghorn v. Clay, — Idaho —, 283 P.3d 779 (2012).

       </p>
       <p>
        Application of plaintiff’s attorneys for an order granting them a lien upon prospective judgment is to protect them in the payment of their fees in the event the plaintiff should recover judgment. Allen v. General Ins. Co., 42 F.2d 901 (D. Idaho 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where attorneys brought suit for, inter alia, a lien on a check made payable to their client, depositing check with clerk of court was not such release of possession as to destroy their lien thereon. Keane v. McFee, 75 Idaho 541, 275 P.2d 960 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attorney’s charging lien did not exist in Idaho at common law; however, such has been codified in Idaho by this section. Frazee v. Frazee, 104 Idaho 463, 660 P.2d 928 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The charging lien of an attorney is equitable in nature and triable to the court. The equitable source of the charging lien necessitates that an attorney take affirmative steps in an adjudicative process to perfect and reduce his lien to a judgment or order of the court. Frazee v. Frazee, 104 Idaho 463, 660 P.2d 928 (1983).

        The attorney who represented the plaintiffs in a 42 USC § 1983 action had a valid claim of lien; however, there could be no adjudication that the attorney had a valid lien in any amount until it was first determined that some amount was owing from the plaintiffs to the attorney in addition to those fees already paid. Jarman v. Hale, 112 Idaho 270, 731 P.2d 813 (Ct. App. 1986) Jarman v. Hale, 122 Idaho 952, 842 P.2d 288 (Ct. App. 1992). Multiple Legal Actions.

        Where law firm had entered into written agreement with client regarding fees for three separate but interrelated legal actions, firm was entitled to enforce its lien under this section by petition in any one of the actions pending after proper notice was given to the client. Skelton v. Spencer, 102 Idaho 69, 625 P.2d 1072, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 894, 102 S. Ct. 390, 70 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1981), overruled in part, Kinghorn v. Clay, — Idaho —, 283 P.3d 779 (2012).

     <ol>
      <li id="t03c03s3-301ol11">

      </li>
      <li id="t03c03s3-301ol12">
       Wilful disobedience or violation of an order of the court, requiring him to do or forbear an act connected with or in course of his profession, and any violation of the oath taken by him or his duties as such attorney and counselor.

       <p>
        Subdivision 5 of this section does not require a law firm to pay a client money to which he is not entitled; accordingly, where a law firm had knowledge of the fact that its client had assigned to a creditor certain proceeds that he hoped to realize from his suit against an insurance company, the firm was required to honor the assignment, and the firm acted improperly when, after receiving the settlement proceeds from the insurance company, it paid them over to its client.

        Moral turpitude is an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man; and, thus, a conviction on the charges of petit larceny is construed as an act of moral turpitude.

        The crime of aiding another to avoid registration, by advising young men, subject to registration, not to register for military service, as required by act of congress, thereby seeking to interfere with the government in its efforts to raise an army in time of war, involves moral turpitude.

        A conviction based upon a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of federal income tax evasion is such a conviction of a felony that subjects attorney to removal, suspension or reprimand. In re Snook, 94 Idaho 904, 499 P.2d 1260 (1972).

        Moral Turpitude.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Moral turpitude is an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man; and, thus, a conviction on the charges of petit larceny is construed as an act of moral turpitude. In re Henry, 15 Idaho 755, 99 P. 1054 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        The crime of aiding another to avoid registration, by advising young men, subject to registration, not to register for military service, as required by act of congress, thereby seeking to interfere with the government in its efforts to raise an army in time of war, involves moral turpitude. In re Hofstede, 31 Idaho 448, 173 P. 1087 (1918). See also In re Kerl, 32 Idaho 737, 188 P. 40 (1920).
    Whether or not offense involves moral turpitude is for determination of court. In re Dampier, 46 Idaho 195, 267 P. 452 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude” as used in this section is intended to include only crimes involving moral turpitude under laws of this state. In re Dampier, 46 Idaho 195, 267 P. 452 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not required that an attorney be free from every vice, and a single act of immorality, not affecting his professional integrity, is not sufficient to justify his disbarment. In re Dampier, 46 Idaho 195, 267 P. 452 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction under United States statute for sending obscene letters through the mail does not necessarily involve moral turpitude in offense, when viewed in light of state legislation. In re Dampier, 46 Idaho 195, 267 P. 452 (1928). See also In re Downs, 46 Idaho 464, 268 P. 17 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Drawing check without funds is crime involving moral turpitude because fraud is element thereof. In re Mills, 71 Idaho 128, 227 P.2d 81 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude because “moral turpitude” modifies misdemeanor rather than felony. In re Snook, 94 Idaho 904, 499 P.2d 1260 (1972).

        A disbarment proceeding is not a criminal action nor its purpose the punishment of the attorney, but it is intended to protect the public and those charged with the administration of justice.

        Where an indictable crime is charged against an attorney, the supreme court will not proceed in disbarment proceedings until criminal proceedings have been taken in the district court, or until sufficient time has elapsed to accord the proper authorities opportunity to prosecute the case in that court. In re Tipton, 4 Idaho 513, 42 P. 504 (1895).

       <p>
        Where an attorney-at-law, admitted to practice in Idaho, has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and a certified copy of the record of his conviction has been filed in the supreme court with a view to bringing about his disbarment, his guilt or innocence is not in issue. In re Kerl, 32 Idaho 737, 188 P. 40 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an indictable crime consisting of violation of professional duty is charged against an attorney, the court will entertain disbarment proceedings independent of any prosecution or conviction. In re Edwards, 45 Idaho 676, 266 P. 665 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        When attorney is convicted of crime involving moral turpitude in courts of the state, it is duty of clerk to transmit certified copy of record of conviction to supreme court and the record of conviction is conclusive; whether offense involves moral turpitude is for determination of court. In re Dampier, 46 Idaho 195, 267 P. 452 (1928).

      The board of commissioners shall be elected by the members of the Idaho State Bar who are eligible to vote in the election and who shall vote by ballot. The candidate from any division receiving the greatest number of votes of that division shall thereby be elected commissioner from such division. Only residents of or members of the Idaho State Bar maintaining an office in a division may vote for candidates for commissioner of that division. The ballots shall be deposited in person or by mail with the executive director of the board, or such other officer as it may designate. There shall be an annual election by the members of the Idaho State Bar eligible to vote for the purpose of electing successors to the commissioners whose terms expire. A commissioner shall be elected during 1974 and every third year thereafter from each of the northern and central divisions; during 1975 and every third year thereafter from each [of] the western and central divisions; and during 1976 and every third year thereafter from the eastern division. The board shall fix the time for holding the annual election and prescribe rules and regulations in regard thereto not in conflict with the provisions of this act. The board shall, in accordance with its rules, give at least sixty (60) days’ notice by mail of the time for holding the election each year. In the event a vacancy shall occur on said board otherwise than by expiration of the term of a commissioner, such vacancy shall be filled by appointment by the remaining members of said board. Such vacancy shall be so filled from the members of the bar residing, or maintaining an office from which they primarily practice law in the state of Idaho in the division where such vacancy occurs and who have appointed an agent for service of process within the state.

      § 3-408. Admission to practice and disbarment proceedings — Rules and bylaws — Power of board to adopt — Supervisory power of supreme court.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners shall have power to determine, by rules, subject to the approval of the supreme court, the qualifications and requirements for admission to the practice of the law and to conduct investigation and examination of applicants, and it shall from time to time certify to the supreme court the names of those applicants found to be qualified. The investigation shall include a fingerprint-based criminal history check of the Idaho central criminal history database and the federal bureau of investigation criminal history database. Each person listed as an applicant on an initial application shall submit a full set of fingerprints with the application. The approval by the supreme court of the applicants whose names are so certified, shall entitle them to enrollment, as members of the bar of this state, and to practice law upon their paying the required fees and taking the oath. The board shall formulate rules governing the conduct of all persons admitted to practice and shall investigate and pass upon all complaints that may be made concerning the professional conduct of any person admitted to the practice of the law. In all cases in which the investigation, in the opinion of a majority of the board, justifies such a course, it shall recommend to the supreme court such disciplinary action by public or private reprimand, suspension from the practice of the law, or exclusion and disbarment therefrom, as the case shall in its judgment warrant. Upon the making of any recommendation by the board reprimanding, suspending or excluding or disbarring any member of the Idaho state bar from the practice of the law, the board shall cause the record of proceedings in said matter or a copy thereof certified by its secretary or president to be filed with the clerk of the supreme court. The supreme court shall thereupon enter such judgment in said matter as it deems proper. The board of commissioners shall also have power to make rules and bylaws, subject to the approval of the supreme court, not in conflict with any of the terms of this act concerning the selection and tenure of its officers and committees and their powers and duties, and generally for the control and regulation of the business of the board and of the Idaho state bar.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners shall also have power after proceedings as in other cases of discipline to recommend to the supreme court the discipline of its officers and the members of its committees in the event of refusal, neglect, failure or corrupt or wrongful performance of their respective duties.

        Cause for Disbarment.

       <p>
        Commission has no power to make and enter a judgment of disbarment for matters wholly outside of and in no way connected with the practice of law. In re Dampier, 46 Idaho 195, 267 P. 452 (1928).

        Constitutionality.

       <p>
        This section, prior to its amendment in 1929, was held unconstitutional, in part, as an attempt to clothe the board with judicial powers. In re Edwards, 45 Idaho 676, 266 P. 665 (1928).

        Due Process.

       <p>
        Rules authorizing the board to act merely in an administrative capacity and as an arm of the supreme court, with the power to make investigations and return to the supreme court its findings and conclusions thereon, are not unconstitutional. In re Edwards, 45 Idaho 676, 266 P. 665 (1928). Due Process.
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure of the Idaho bar commission to make findings of fact deprived a bar applicant of his right to due process of law. His interest in practicing law in Idaho was a substantial interest. The administrative cost of making findings of fact would be minimal. There would be no ancillary disruptive effect on the administrative efficiency of the commission. Dexter v. Idaho State Bd. of Comm’rs, 116 Idaho 790, 780 P.2d 112 (1989).

       <p>
        Even though Idaho bar commission rules merely require that the commission “enter its decision affirming or reversing its previous action within 14 days,” the commissioners have a duty to formulate findings of fact and conclusions of law so that a reviewing court may have a basis to conduct meaningful review.

        S.L. 1923, ch. 211 (§§ 3-401 to 3-420), as amended by S.L. 1925, chaps. 89 and 90, did not delegate any legislative powers to, or confer any judicial powers upon, the board. In re Edwards, 45 Idaho 676, 266 P. 665 (1928).

        The practice of law as generally understood is the doing or performing services in a court of justice, in any matter depending therein, throughout its various stages, and in conformity with the adopted rules of procedure; but in a larger sense, it includes legal advice and counsel, and the preparation of instruments and contracts by which legal rights are secured, although such matter may or may not be pending in a court.

        Individual who knowingly and willfully violated orders prohibiting her from filing bankruptcy cases for her corporate entities for one year without first obtaining court permission, and without filing complete schedules with the petitions, was enjoined from signing or otherwise causing the filing of any bankruptcy petition in any bankruptcy court on behalf of any person or entity other than herself. Accordingly, she violated this section when she filed three more cases on behalf of her entities contrary to those orders, and personally signed petitions in two of those cases despite the fact that she was not an attorney.

        Advising a debtor filing for bankruptcy of available exemptions from which to choose, or actually choosing an exemption for the debtor with no explanation, requires the exercise of legal judgment beyond the capacity and knowledge of lay persons, and plugging in solicited information from questionnaires and personal interviews to a pre-packaged bankruptcy software program constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.
