        Former banking act enacted in 1925 and the business incorporation act enacted in 1929 were not repugnant to each other on the power of the stockholders of a banking institution to remove members of the board of directors, since the banking act was silent on the question and the business incorporation law expressly provides for removal of members of the board by the stockholders.

     <p>
      It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in or transact any banking business in this state except by means of a corporation duly organized for that purpose and chartered under the bank act. Corporations organized to engage in and transact banking business shall be formed by five (5) or more natural persons under the general business corporation laws of this state and as provided in the bank act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as specifically authorized by this act, other laws of the state of Idaho, or federal law, no person except a national bank shall engage in or transact any banking business except as is incidental or necessarily preliminary to its organization without the written approval of the director and without his written charter stating that it has complied with the provisions of the bank act and all of the requirements of law and that it is authorized to transact banking business within the state. To obtain a charter the incorporators shall file with the director the following information:
     </p>

      Upon filing of the foregoing, it shall be the duty of the department to examine and investigate into the condition of the corporation, ascertaining whether or not the capital has been paid in and whether the corporation has complied with all the provisions of the law required to entitle it to engage in the business of banking. The department shall also ascertain from the best sources of information at its command whether the character and general fitness of the persons named as subscribers and officers and directors are such that the bank may be operated in a safe, prudent and profitable manner and as to command the confidence of the community in which such bank is proposed to be located. If upon such examination, and investigation, it appears that the corporation is lawfully entitled to commence banking business, and the directors and officers are competent to engage in banking business, and its subscribers are such as to command the confidence of the community, and if, in the opinion of the director the organization of the bank is justified, the director shall forthwith issue to the corporation a bank charter, under official seal.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the director has reason to believe that the corporation has been formed for any other business than the legitimate banking business contemplated by the bank act or that the subscribers, officers and directors will not operate the bank in a safe, prudent and profitable manner, or that the bank will not have qualified experienced management with experience commensurate with the area where the bank is proposed to be located, he shall withhold such charter, and he may withhold the issuance of such charter to a corporation seeking to engage in banking business in an area which in his judgment does not justify or warrant a new or additional bank or could not support a profitable banking corporation.

        Defendant commissioner (now director) appealed from judgment of trial court in mandamus proceedings requiring his approval as to form and content and return to plaintiff of articles of incorporation for a bank and issuance to it of certificate or charter authorizing it to engage in the banking business, when the trial court had held that the right of the plaintiffs to recover was to be determined by facts existing at the time of the commencement of the action and their right could not be prejudiced or affected by the subsequent action of the defendant in thereafter making findings of fact.

       <p>
        Defendant commissioner’s (now director’s) contention of discretionary action in mandamus proceedings brought to compel him to issue a certificate to allow corporation to engage in a banking business could not be sustained where plaintiffs had filed all instruments required by law, that the bank had complied with all provisions of law required to entitle it to engage in a banking business, that the character and general fitness of such stockholders and officers of said bank were such as to command the confidence of the community in which said bank was to be located, could not be sustained, defendant commissioner (now director) having expressly approved the application as to all matters except those discretionary. Leuhrs v. Spaulding, 80 Idaho 326, 328 P.2d 582 (1958).
    This section authorizes the commissioner (now director) to ascertain, weigh and pass judgment upon the facts relating to the character and general fitness of the persons named as stockholders and officers to command the confidence of the community, their competency to engage in a banking business and whether conditions warrant the organization of a new and additional bank, such matters clearly involving discretion. The same section makes it the mandatory duty of the commissioner (now director), if the questions be answered in the affirmative, forthwith to issue the certificate and authorizes him to withhold certificate if answers in the negative. Leuhrs v. Spaulding, 80 Idaho 326, 328 P.2d 582 (1958).

       <p>
        Where under the facts the granting of the bank charter by defendant commissioner (now director) was purely a ministerial act, the writ of mandamus would be properly issued, defendant having determined that banking corporators had complied with all statutory provisions required to entitle such bank to engage in banking, stockholders and officers were of such character and general fitness as to command confidence in the community, the additional bank was justified in that area, such bank was entitled lawfully to commence business in the community, stockholders would command confidence in the community.

        The fear of defendant commissioner (now director) of retaliation by the comptroller of the currency if he issued a bank charter was not of itself a legal reason for denying the charter, it not being one of the statutory reasons for withholding as said comptroller might issue a number of charters. Leuhrs v. Spaulding, 80 Idaho 326, 328 P.2d 582 (1958).

      § 26-309. Customer-bank communication terminal.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A bank may make available for use by its customers one (1) or more electronic devices or machines through which the customer may communicate to the bank a request to withdraw money either from his account or from a previously authorized line of credit, or an instruction to receive or transfer funds for the customer’s benefit. The device may receive or dispense cash in accordance with such a request or instruction, subject to verification on line or off line by the bank. Any transactions initiated through such a device shall be subject to verification by the bank either by direct wire transmission or otherwise. Such facilities may be unmanned or manned.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person may perform as would a device so long as the person does not perform any functions not specifically authorized by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      These devices shall be designated as a customer-bank communication terminal (CBCT). The use of a CBCT at locations other than the main office or a branch office of the bank does not constitute branch banking. A bank shall provide insurance protection under its bonding program for transactions involving such devices.

     <p>
      Whenever a bank, referred to in this section as an “applying bank,” subject to examination by either the department of finance of the state of Idaho, or a federal bank supervisory agency, applies for a type of bank service for itself from a bank service corporation which supplies the same type of bank services to another bank, and the applying bank is competitive with any bank, referred to in this section as a “stockholding bank,” which holds stock in such corporation, the corporation must offer to supply such services by either:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t26c04s26-404ol1a">
       issuing stock to the applying bank and furnishing bank services to it on the same basis as to the other banks holding stock in the corporation, or
      </li>
      <li id="t26c04s26-404ol1b">
       furnishing bank services to the applying bank at rates no higher than necessary to fairly reflect the cost of such services, including the reasonable cost of the capital provided to the corporation by its stockholders, at the corporation’s option, unless comparable services at competitive overall cost are available to the applying bank from another source, or unless the furnishing of the services sought by the applying bank would be beyond the practical capacity of the corporation. In any action or proceeding to enforce the duty imposed by this section, or for damages for the breach thereof, the burden shall be upon the bank service corporation to show such availability.

      All transfers of a major portion of the outstanding stock or trust certificates of a bank holding company by sale, gift, or otherwise shall be approved by the director prior to such transfer. For the purposes of this section, a major portion of the outstanding stock or trust certificates of a bank holding company is any number of any class of shares of a bank holding company the acquisition of which will result in a person acquiring the shares having voting control of the bank holding company. The director shall not approve a transfer of stock if he finds that the transferee has been removed from a position as a director, officer or employee of a bank holding company, a bank or other financial institution pursuant to an order of a state or federal agency. The director may disapprove a transfer of stock if in his opinion the transferee does not meet the requirements of a stockholder, director, or officer as set out in section 26-502, Idaho Code.

      § 26-604. Dividends — Surplus.
     </h3>
     <p>
      No dividend shall be declared or paid by any bank until a surplus equal to twenty percent (20%) of the paid-in capital stock of such bank has been built up. Thereafter, the board of directors of any bank may declare a dividend of so much of its net profits as it shall deem expedient; but before any such dividend is declared or paid, not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the net profits of the bank for such period as is covered by the dividend shall be carried to the surplus fund until such surplus fund shall amount to fifty percent (50%) of the paid-in common stock. Any loss sustained by any bank in excess of its undivided profits may be charged to its surplus account, provided that its surplus funds shall thereafter be reimbursed from its earnings in the manner above provided. If such surplus fund is reduced below an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the common stock, no further dividend shall be declared or paid until such surplus is restored to that amount, and thereafter dividends shall only be declared and paid in the amount and in the manner above provided until such surplus shall be restored to an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the common stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors knowingly voting for any dividend in violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be jointly and severally liable, civilly, for any and all dividends so declared, and in addition thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

       “Borrower” means a person who is named as a borrower or debtor in a loan or extension of credit, a counterparty to whom a bank has credit exposure in a derivative transaction entered into by the bank, or any other person including a drawer, endorser or guarantor, who is deemed to be a borrower under the direct benefit and common enterprise tests set forth in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c07s26-705ol13">
       “Derivative transaction” includes any transaction that is a contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note or option that is based, in whole or in part, on the value of, any interest in or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one (1) or more commodities, securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices or other assets.

      <li id="t26c07s26-705ol14">
       “Loans and extensions of credit” means a bank’s direct or indirect advance of funds to or on behalf of a borrower based upon an obligation of the borrower to repay the funds, or repayable from specific property pledged by or on behalf of the borrower, and includes, for the purposes of this section:
       <ol Class="alpha">

         A bank’s purchase of third-party paper subject to an agreement that the seller shall repurchase the paper upon default or at the end of a stated period. The amount of the bank’s loan is the total unpaid balance of the paper owned by the bank less any applicable dealer reserves retained by the bank and held by the bank as collateral security. Where the seller’s obligation to repurchase is limited, the bank’s loan is measured by the total amount of the paper the seller may ultimately be obligated to repurchase. A bank’s purchase of third party paper without direct or indirect recourse to the seller is not a loan or extension of credit to the seller;

      Except as authorized under this section, no bank may extend credit in any manner to any of its own executive officers. Any extension of credit under this section must be approved by the board of directors of the bank, and may be made only if such credit extension comports with the principles of safety and soundness and is in compliance with regulation O of the board of governors of the federal reserve system, 12 CFR 215. Each executive officer and director who receives an extension of credit from the bank shall submit a personal financial statement to the chief executive officer of the bank at least once during each calendar year and such financial statement shall be made available to federal or state regulatory agencies upon request by the agency.

      A bank may purchase, acquire, hold and convey real estate for the following purposes only:

     <ol>
      <li id="t26c07s26-707ol11">

       Such as it shall purchase at sale on judgments, decrees, mortgage foreclosure or trustees sale for debts previously contracted, but a bank shall not bid at such sale a larger amount than is necessary to satisfy all debts and costs necessary to obtain clear title. Real estate acquired for debts previously contracted shall be carried on the books of the bank at the lower of cost or market value. Market value shall be determined by:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t26c07s26-707ol13a">
         An appraisal prepared by a state certified or licensed appraiser; or

         An appropriate evaluation when the recorded investment is equal to or less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t26c07s26-707ol14">
       No real estate acquired under subsections (2) and (3) of this section may be held for a longer period than five (5) years, provided however, that upon application by the bank, the director shall approve the continued holding of any such real estate by the bank for an additional period of five (5) years upon the bank’s showing of its good faith attempt to dispose of the real estate within the first five (5) year period, or that disposal within the first five (5) year period would be detrimental to the bank; and provided further that the bank shall, during the second five (5) year period, at the end of each year beginning at the end of the sixth year in which the property is held, write down the value of such real estate by twenty percent (20%) of the value at which such real estate is carried on its books at the beginning of the second five (5) year period. Value at the beginning of the second five (5) year period shall be the lower of cost or market value as determined pursuant to appraisal as provided in subsection (3) of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a bank from making loans secured by real estate as provided in this act, or a trust department holding and conveying real estate in trust.
    (5) A bank may, with the approval of the director and the board of governors of the federal reserve system or the federal deposit insurance corporation invest in bank premises or in the stock, bonds, debentures, or other obligations of any corporation holding the banking buildings, lots and furniture, fixtures and equipment of such bank in an amount not to exceed the capital and surplus of the bank.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If a bank has a valid appraisal or an appropriate evaluation that was previously obtained in connection with a real estate loan, a new appraisal or evaluation is not required at the time the bank acquires the property to determine the market value of real estate acquired for debts previously contracted. A bank may defer obtaining an appraisal or evaluation for a period not to exceed three (3) months following acquisition of the real estate if the bank documents a reasonable expectation that a sale of the real estate, other than in a transaction involving an affiliated party, will be consummated during a period of three (3) months following the acquisition of the property. If the property is not sold during the expected three (3) month period, a new appraisal or appropriate evaluation as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection must be obtained. Thereafter, the director may in his discretion require an appraisal or evaluation if the director believes it is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns. A bank shall develop and maintain prudent real estate appraisal and evaluation policies and procedures to monitor the market value of real estate acquired for debts previously contracted, in accordance with applicable real estate appraisal and evaluation guidelines.

     <p>
      Any bank deeming itself aggrieved by the action of the director in taking possession of its assets or closing its doors may, within ten (10) days after such possession shall have been taken, apply to the district court of the county in which its principal place of business is located, or to the judge thereof in chambers, to enjoin further proceedings by the director, and the court or the judge thereof in chambers, after notifying the director to appear at a specified time and place to show cause why further proceedings should not be enjoined, and after hearing the allegations and proofs of the parties, and determining facts, may, on the merits, dismiss such application, or enjoin the director from further proceeding and direct him to surrender the business and assets of said bank. Such application for injunction may be heard at any time after five (5) days’ notice from the time of service on said director in the discretion of the court, or the judge thereof, or at any time prior thereto by the consent of the director. Application therefor shall be made on the verified complaint of the bank, in the ordinary form used in civil actions in district court, and a copy of such complaint shall be served on the director with the order to show cause. The director shall, at least two (2) days before the time set for hearing, file in the cause, and serve upon counsel for plaintiff an answer to the complaint, also in the ordinary form used in civil actions in the district court. Demurrers and motions directed to pleadings are not permissible in proceedings had under this section, but any questions raised by demurrer or motion in other actions may be raised in the answer. On the issues thus made on the complaint and answer, the court, or the judge thereof at chambers, at the time fixed for showing cause, or at such other time to which he, in his discretion, may continue the same, shall try the matter on the merits by hearing the allegations and proofs of the parties in the same manner as on the trial of ordinary civil actions in the district court, and the rules governing the trial of ordinary civil actions and for the production and taking of evidence and hearing the examinations of witnesses and the entry of findings and judgments therein, shall prevail. In the event the director makes no appearance in the time limited, the court shall enter his default and proceed to hear the proofs of the plaintiff in like manner as in civil actions under similar circumstances, and enter judgment accordingly. The judgment entered either after hearing on the merits or by default, shall be final judgment from which either party shall have the right, by notice filed within twenty (20) days after entry, to appeal to the supreme court, in the same manner as from final judgment in a civil action.

Such agent and other employees hereinafter mentioned, shall receive a salary, to be fixed as hereinafter provided, for the time he is actually engaged in the performance of such duties. The director may also employ such attorneys and procure such expert accountants and other experts, assistants and employees as may be necessary in the liquidation and distribution of the assets of any such bank, and the performance of his duties hereunder, and may retain such of the officers or employees of such bank as he may deem necessary. He shall require from the agent appointed by him and from such of the assistants as will have charge of any of the assets of the bank such security for the faithful discharge of their duties as he may deem proper.

     <p>
      The director may also designate any one of the examiners of the department of finance as a general liquidating agent, with his office in the department of finance, for the purpose of liquidating any one or all state banks in the process of liquidation, and for the purpose of conducting such liquidation under the direction of said director; and may authorize the said liquidating agent to employ such clerical help as may be necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Liquidating agents and experts and clerical assistants shall receive a salary to be fixed by the director and necessary traveling and hotel expenses incurred in the performance of official duties. The salary of the liquidating agent and experts and necessary clerical assistance [assistants] and other expenses incurred by the said liquidating agent shall be borne equally and ratably by the bank or banks in process of liquidation under such agent’s charge in proportion to the total amount of resources of each of such banks. The funds for such expenses shall be raised by assessing each bank in ratio herein set forth and paying such expenses directly to the persons entitled thereto, without depositing any of such funds in the state treasury.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation of the agents appointed by the director and of attorneys, expert accountants and other assistants, and all expenses of liquidation and distribution of a bank whose assets and business shall be taken possession of by the director, shall be fixed by the director, but subject to be approved by the judge of the district court of the county in which the bank is located, on notice to such bank. Except in cases of emergency, the compensation to be paid to attorneys and expert accountants shall be fixed and approved before services are rendered. When the compensation shall have been so fixed and approved and the services rendered, the same shall be paid out of the funds of such bank in the hands of the director, and shall be a proper charge and lien on the assets of such bank as herein provided.

      § 26-1011. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation — Right to act as receiver or liquidator.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation created by section 8 of the federal “Banking Act of 1933” (section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended) is hereby authorized and empowered to be and act without bond as receiver or liquidator of any banking institution, the deposits in which are to any extent insured by said corporation, and which shall have been closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, in lieu of the director of finance, but only if and when requested so to do by said director.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director of the department of finance may, in his discretion, in the event of such closing tender to said corporation the appointment as receiver or liquidator of such banking institution, in his stead, and if the corporation accepts said appointment, the corporation shall have and possess all the rights, powers and privileges provided by the laws of this state with respect to the director of the department of finance acting as receiver or liquidator of a banking institution, and be subject to all the duties of such receiver or liquidator, except insofar as such rights, powers, privileges or duties are in conflict with the provisions of subsection (1) of section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended (section 8 of the “Banking Act of 1933”).
     </p>
     <p>
      The corporation shall not, however, without the consent of the director of the department of finance, continue to act as receiver or liquidator of any banking institution after the amount of the insured deposit liability of such banking institution, paid or assumed by the corporation, and the costs of liquidation paid or assumed by it have been repaid it, or after funds are available therefor.

      Claims presented to the director prior to the expiration of the time fixed in the notice to creditors therefor, and allowed by him, shall be paid in the order of priority hereinafter fixed. Those filed after such expiration and prior to one (1) year thereafter shall be entitled, after they have been allowed by the director, to share in the distribution of the assets of the bank only to the extent of the assets undistributed in the hands of the director and available for the payment of claims of their order of priority at the time such claims are filed, but as against other claims of their same order of priority, on which dividends have been paid, they shall be entitled to payment in a proportionate amount before further payments are made on such other claims. All claims filed after the expiration of one (1) year following the date fixed in the notice to creditors as the time for presentation of claims are not entitled to be allowed or paid unless all other creditors’ claims of any kind or character, except claims of shareholders, based on stock or assessments paid on stock, shall have been fully paid and discharged, and a surplus remains in the hands of the director, and then only from such surplus.

       Debts due depositors, holders of cashier’s checks, certified checks, drafts on correspondent banks, including protest fees, paid by them on valid checks or drafts presented after closing of the bank, pro rata. All deposit balances of other banks or trust companies and all deposits of public funds of every kind and character (except those actually placed on special deposit under the statutes providing therefor) including those of the United States, the state of Idaho, and every county, district, municipality, political subdivision or public corporation of this state, whether secured or unsecured, or whether deposited in violation of law or otherwise, are included within the terms of this subdivision and take the same priority as debts due any other depositor, anything in the statutes of the state of Idaho to the contrary notwithstanding.

     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, that the director may, in his discretion, without regard to the priorities herein fixed in subdivisions 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this section, or in preference to the payment of any claims of creditors within these subdivisions, pay off and discharge any lien, claim or charge against the assets or property of the bank in his hands and pay out and expend such sums as he deems necessary for the preservation, maintenance, conservation and protection of any such assets and property, and likewise property on which the bank has liens by mortgage or otherwise; and he may also, in his discretion, create a fund or retain in his hands in preference to the claim of any creditors in the subdivisions above-mentioned moneys for the aforesaid purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Collateral which shall have been put up or pledged as security for the payment of bills payable by any bank, or any loans or discounts which shall have been outstanding as rediscounts of any bank prior to the closing thereof, shall not be available to the other creditors of such bank in whole or in part until such bills payable or rediscounts shall have been retired.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposits of any person, firm or corporation in a bank which is in the possession of the director, may be offset against any indebtedness, (subject to the conditions of the preceding paragraph of this section) due to such bank from such person, firm or corporation. All dividends when declared in favor of any creditor of the bank may be applied, in the discretion of the director, in satisfaction of the indebtedness, if any, due the bank from such creditor.

      § 26-1020. Partial payment of claims — Calculation of dividends — Assignment of claims — Checks against closed bank.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The director need not await the expiration of the time allowed for filing claims, as fixed in the notice to the creditors, for the payment of dividends, but he may, in his discretion, and if under the circumstances of the particular case he deems it expedient and safe, at any time after taking possession of said bank and prior to the expiration of such period fixed for filing of claims, if he has on hand in cash sufficient funds over and above the expenses of liquidation, make pro rata distribution to any class of creditors next entitled thereto, in the order of priority heretofore fixed, making such payment to said creditors as they appear on the books and records of the bank and determining the priority and basing his apportionment on the amount shown to be due by such books and records. At any time after the expiration of the date fixed for the presentation of claims against said bank and from time to time thereafter, when, in his discretion there are sufficient funds available therefor, the director shall, after making proper provision for the payment of expenses of liquidation, declare and pay dividends to all creditors of such bank pro rata in the order of their priority. If, after the time fixed for presentation of claims against the bank has expired, it appears that any person, prior to the expiration of said period, or at any other time, has been paid more than the pro rata amount due him as compared with the amounts then paid other creditors, nothing more shall be paid said creditor until such time as the payment made other creditors shall place them on equal footing. In calculating dividends, all disputed claims and deposits shall be taken into account and the amount of dividends upon such disputed claims or deposits shall be held by the director until the justice and validity of such claims or deposits shall have been finally determined. Claims against any bank in process of liquidation may be assigned as a whole, but partial assignments of such claims shall not be valid against the director of the department of finance or his agents in charge of such bank, nor recognized by them. Assignments of claims shall be binding upon the director only after the same have been filed and allowed by the director but not before, and only then subject to the payment of the assignor’s liabilities to the bank. Such assignment shall be made by filing written notice, signed by the original claimant, with the director or person in charge of said bank. No assigned claim may be offset against obligations due the bank. A check or draft drawn against any bank closed or taken possession of by the director, whether issued before or after closing thereof, shall not be recognized as a claim against said bank, or as an assignment of any amount, whether protested or not protested.

      Whenever the director has paid to each and every depositor and creditor of such bank whose claims shall have been duly approved and allowed as herein provided, the full amount thereof, and shall have made provisions for unclaimed and unpaid deposits and disputed claims and deposits, and shall have paid all the expenses of liquidation or, if the assets of said bank be insufficient for making said payments, then, whenever the director has liquidated all available assets and disbursed the same as herein provided, the director shall make application to the district court of the county in which such bank is located, or the judge thereof in chambers for an order authorizing the director, if there be remaining assets on hand, to surrender the same to the directors of said bank in office at the time of closing the same, as trustees for stockholders, or to such other person or persons, if any, as have been designated as trustees by the stockholders at a meeting lawfully called and assembled for such purpose, in like manner as any other stockholders’ meeting. Said order shall also provide that upon the surrender of said assets, as in said order directed, and where there are no remaining assets, then, upon the entry of the order, the director shall be discharged from all further liability or responsibility in connection with the assets and affairs of said bank and that the charter of said bank shall be forfeited. The court may require such trustees to give bond in such amount as the court may fix, conditioned for the faithful performance of their duties. It shall be the duty of the said trustee or trustees to complete the liquidation of any remaining assets as rapidly as may be and to distribute the proceeds of the same among the stockholders according to their respective rights. On application for such order, the bank shall be made a party by notice issued on order of the court or judge, in lieu of summons, but served in like manner, and the hearing of any such application may be had at any time in court or in chambers, as the court may order, after five (5) days’ notice of the hearing.

      § 26-1113. Impairment of capital — Assessment.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any law of this state to the contrary, the stock of a bank chartered by the state of Idaho shall be assessable. Whenever the director has reason to believe that the capital and surplus of any bank is impaired or reduced below the amount required by the director at the time the bank’s charter was issued or an amount which the director reasonably believes to be necessary for the protection of the depositors of the bank, it shall be the duty of the director to examine said bank and ascertain the facts. In case he finds an impairment or reduction of capital and surplus, he shall order the bank to make good the deficiency within thirty (30) days after the date of the order. The directors of the bank upon which an order shall have been made, shall levy an assessment upon the stock of the bank to repair the capital deficiency. The director shall cause notice of the order and the amount of the assessment to be given to each stockholder of the bank. Notice shall be given by a written notice mailed to each stockholder at his last known address or served personally upon him. If any stockholder shall refuse or neglect to pay the assessment specified in the notice within ten (10) days from the date of mailing or service upon him of the notice, the directors of the bank shall have the right to sell the stock of such stockholder, at public auction. Previous notice of such sale shall be given ten (10) days in advance of the date of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the principal place of business of the bank is located. A copy of the notice of sale shall also be served personally on the stockholder or by mailing same to his last known address ten (10) days before the day fixed for the sale. Such stock may be sold at private sale and without such public notice; provided that an offer in writing shall first be obtained and a copy thereof served upon the owner of record of the stock sought to be sold, either personally or by mailing a copy of the offer to his last known address. If, after service of the offer, the owner shall refuse or neglect to pay the assessment within two (2) weeks from the time of the service of the offer, the directors may accept the offer and sell the stock to the person(s) making the offer, or to any other person(s) making a larger offer than the offer submitted to the stockholder. Stock shall in no event be sold for less than the amount of the assessment called for and the expense of the sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stockholder whose shares of stock are to be sold shall return the certificates evidencing such shares to the bank prior to the date the shares will be sold.
     </p>
     <p>
      Out of the proceeds of the stock so sold, the directors shall pay the amount of assessment levied thereon and the necessary costs of sale, and the balance, if any, shall be paid to the person or persons whose stock has thus been sold. A sale of stock as herein provided shall effect an absolute cancelation of the outstanding certificate or certificates evidencing the stock so sold and shall make the same null and void, and a new certificate shall be issued to the purchaser thereof.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t26c14s26-1402ol11">
       A bank or trust company may transfer some or all of its fiduciary capacities to an affiliated bank or an affiliated trust company. To accomplish such a transfer, the bank or trust company shall file a verified application in the district court of the county in which the bank’s or trust company’s principal place of business is located, requesting that every fiduciary capacity of the bank or trust company, except as may be expressly excluded in such application, be transferred to an affiliated bank or affiliated trust company specified in the application, and the specified affiliated bank or affiliated trust company shall join in such application. The application shall indicate the county in which the principal place of business of the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company joining in the application is located.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c14s26-1402ol12">
       When any application under subsection (1) of this section has been filed, the clerk of the court where the application is filed shall enter an order fixing a date and time (which date shall not be more than sixty (60) days from the date the application is filed) for a hearing on the application. The bank or trust company filing an application under subsection (1) of this section shall prepare a notice as provided in subsection (3) of this section, and shall cause a copy of such notice to be published at least once a week for three (3) successive weeks preceding the hearing date, the first such publication to be at least thirty (30) days preceding the hearing date. Proof of such publication shall be made by certified copy of the notice or by affidavit, and the same shall be filed with the district court wherein the application was filed. Such publication shall be in a newspaper of general circulation published in each county in which the principal place of business of the bank or trust company is located or, if in any case there is no such newspaper, then in a newspaper of general circulation published in a contiguous county. In addition, at least thirty (30) days preceding the hearing date, the bank or trust company shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed by first class mail to all persons entitled to and then receiving trust accountings from the bank or trust company.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c14s26-1402ol13">
       The notice to be published and mailed with respect to each application shall state the time and place of the hearing on the application, the name of the bank or trust company that has filed the application, the name of the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company which has joined in the application, that a transfer is requested of fiduciary capacities to the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company specified in the application, and that any interested person may file with the clerk of the court, on or before the date of the hearing, a written objection to the transfer as provided in subsection (4) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c14s26-1402ol14">
       On or before the date and time of the hearing on the application, any interested person, who is authorized by a will or relevant trust instrument to prohibit, challenge, amend or revoke a transfer of a fiduciary capacity otherwise allowed under this chapter and arising from a fiduciary account in which the person is interested, may file an objection to such transfer with the clerk of the court. Failure to file an objection on or before the date and time of the hearing on the application shall constitute a waiver by such interested person of the right to object under this subsection, and waiver of any power under a will or relevant trust instrument to prohibit, challenge, amend, or revoke with respect to any transfer of fiduciary capacity otherwise authorized under this chapter.
    (5) At the hearing, upon finding that notice has been given as required in this section, and upon finding that the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company has been duly authorized by the director to commence the business for which it is organized, the district court shall enter an order transferring to the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company every fiduciary capacity of the bank or trust company, excepting as may be otherwise specified in the application and excepting fiduciary capacities with respect to which a proper objection has been filed pursuant to subsection (4) of this section. Upon entry of the order, the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company shall, without further act and by operation of law, be substituted in every such fiduciary capacity. The transfer may be made a matter of record in any county of this state by filing a certified copy of the order of transfer in the office of the clerk of any district court in this state or by filing a certified copy of such order in the office of the recorder of any county in this state, to be recorded and indexed by such officer in like manner and with like effect as other orders and decrees of courts are recorded and indexed. Any fiduciary capacities of the bank or trust company excepted from the order of transfer shall remain with such bank or trust company.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (6) Each designation of the bank or trust company as fiduciary in a will or other relevant trust instrument executed before or after the date the order of transfer is entered shall be deemed a designation of the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company substituted for such bank or trust company pursuant to this section, except when such will or other relevant trust instrument is executed after the order of transfer and expressly negates the application of the provisions of this section. Any grant in any such will or other relevant trust instrument of any discretionary power shall be deemed conferred upon the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company deemed designated as the fiduciary pursuant to an order of transfer under the provisions of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (7) Each bank or trust company shall account jointly with the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company which has been substituted as fiduciary pursuant to this section for the accounting period during which the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company is initially so substituted. Upon a transfer of fiduciary capacities pursuant to the provisions of this section, each bank or trust company shall deliver to the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company all related fiduciary accounts and assets held by such bank or trust company (except assets held for accounts with respect to which there has been no transfer of fiduciary capacities pursuant to this section), and upon such transfer the affiliated bank or affiliated trust company shall, without the necessity of any instrument of transfer or conveyance, succeed to all rights, privileges, duties, obligations and undertakings under any fiduciary capacity and fiduciary account transferred in the manner authorized in this chapter.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of this act is to allow any federal savings bank, federal mutual savings bank or federal savings and loan association, located in Idaho to convert its charter to that of an Idaho bank, an Idaho stock savings bank or an Idaho mutual savings bank. Banks and credit unions chartered either under this title or federal law are also allowed to convert to savings banks as provided herein. Once converted, an Idaho stock savings bank or mutual savings bank shall operate and be supervised pursuant to this act. A savings bank operating under this act may convert to a federal charter as a federal savings bank or federal savings and loan association if authorized by federal law. A savings bank under this act may also convert to a bank charter or to a credit union charter. Wherever the term “savings and loan association” is used in the Idaho Code, it shall include savings banks chartered under this act or associations doing business in this state pursuant to section 26-1815, Idaho Code.

      § 26-1813. Mutual to stock conversions.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A mutual savings bank may change its form of organization to that of a stock savings bank by filing an application with the director.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the application, the savings bank will include a plan of conversion, which the director may approve, with or without amendment, if it appears that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t26c18s26-1813ol11">
       After conversion the savings bank will be in sound financial condition;
      </li>
      <li id="t26c18s26-1813ol12">
       The conversion will be fair and equitable to the members of the savings bank and no person whether member, employee or otherwise, will receive any inequitable gain or advantage by reason of the conversion;
      </li>
      <li id="t26c18s26-1813ol13">
       The savings bank services provided to the public by the savings bank will not be adversely affected by the conversion;
      </li>
      <li id="t26c18s26-1813ol14">
       The plan has been approved by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the board of directors of the savings bank;
      </li>
      <li id="t26c18s26-1813ol15">
       All shares of stock issued in connection with the conversion are offered first to the members of the savings bank;
      </li>
      <li id="t26c18s26-1813ol16">
       All stock shall be offered to members of the savings bank and others under a formula and procedure that is fair and equitable and will be fairly disclosed to all interested persons; and
      </li>
      <li id="t26c18s26-1813ol17">
       The plan provides a statement as to whether stockholders shall have preemptive rights to acquire additional or treasury shares of the savings bank.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The plan shall be submitted to the members, but only after it has been approved by the director. After lawful notice to the members of the savings bank and full and fair disclosure, the substance of the plan must be approved by a majority of the total votes that members of the savings bank are eligible and entitled to cast. The vote by the members may be in person or by proxy. Any votes by proxy must be specific to the plan and not a general proxy. Following the vote of the members, the results of the vote certified by an appropriate officer of the savings bank shall be filed with the director. The director shall then either approve or disapprove the requested change in corporate form. After approval, the director shall supervise the conversion process and shall ensure that the process is conducted lawfully and under the approved plan.

These rules and regulations shall give account to the number of potential members, their stability of employment or membership in the group comprising the common bond of membership and the economic characteristics of the proposed common bond.

The shares of a credit union shall all be common shares of one (1) class and have a par value as established by the board and bylaws.

Members may also purchase certificates of deposit which will be for a specified length of time and earn interest with a guaranteed rate to be established by the board of directors pursuant to section 26-2130, Idaho Code. No certificate shall be issued to denote ownership of a share of the credit union. Shares paid for may be transferred in such manner as the bylaws may prescribe.

     <p>
      In the event of default the credit union shall have and may exercise a lien on the shares and deposits of any member for any sum due the credit union from said member or for any loan made to, cosigned or endorsed by him. Christmas clubs, vacation clubs, travel clubs and other thrift organizations within the membership, which shall have the prior approval of the director of finance, may be established by the board of directors.

      Share [Shares] may be issued in the name of a member in trust for a beneficiary, including a minor, but no beneficiary, unless a member in his own right, may be permitted to vote, obtain loans, hold office or be required to pay an entrance fee. Payment of part or all of such shares to such member shall, to the extent of such payment, discharge the liability of the credit union to the member and the beneficiary, and the credit union shall be under no obligation to see the application of such payment. In the event of the death of the member, and if shares are so issued or held and the credit union has been given no other written evidence of the existence or terms of any trust, such shares and any dividends or interest thereon shall be paid to the beneficiary.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the losses of any credit union, resulting from a depreciating in value of its loans or investments or otherwise, exceed its undivided earnings and reserve fund so that the estimated value of its assets is less than the total amount due the shareholders, the credit union may, by a majority vote of the entire membership, order a reduction in the shares of each of its shareholders to divide the loss proportionately among the members. If thereafter the credit union shall realize from such assets a greater amount than was fixed by the order of reduction, such excess shall be divided among the shareholders whose assets were reduced, but only to the extent of such reduction.

      § 26-2132. Merger.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any credit union may, with the approval of the director, merge with another credit union under the existing charter of such other credit union. The director shall not approve a merger if the effect of the merger would be to provide a broader common bond than allowable under section 26-2110, Idaho Code. The merger may be based upon any plan agreed to by the majority of the board of directors of each credit union joining in the merger, and approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the members of each such credit union at meetings of the members called for such purpose. Any member not present at the meeting may, within the next twenty (20) days, vote by signing a statement on a form prescribed by the board of directors and such vote shall have as full force and effect as if cast at the meeting. If any such member does not vote within the twenty (20) day period, he shall be deemed to be in favor of the merger. After such agreement by the directors and approval by the members of each credit union, the president and secretary of each credit union shall execute a certificate of merger which shall set forth at least all of the following:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t26c21s26-2132ol1a">
       The time and place of the meeting of the board of directors at which the plan was agreed upon.

       The vote in favor of adoption of the plan.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li id="t26c21s26-2132ol1d">
       The time and place of the meeting of the members at which the plan agreed upon was approved.

       The vote by which the plan was approved by the members.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Such certificates and a copy of the plan of the merger shall be forwarded to the director and if approved, a copy of the certificate shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which each credit union participating in the merger has its principal place of business, and then filed with the director, whereupon the charter of the merged credit union as a legal entity separate from the surviving credit union shall terminate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon any such merger so affected, all property, property rights, and interests of the merged credit union, shall vest in the surviving credit union without deed, endorsement or other instrument of transfer, and all debts, obligations and liabilities of the merged credit union shall be deemed to have been assumed by the surviving credit union whose charter the merger has affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall be construed, when possible, to permit a credit union chartered under the Federal Credit Union Act to merge with one chartered under this chapter, or to permit one chartered under this chapter to merge with one chartered under the Federal Credit Union Act.

     <ol>
      <li id="t26c21s26-2142ol11">
       A credit union may elect to dissolve voluntarily and wind up its affairs in the following manner: The board shall adopt a resolution recommending that the credit union be dissolved voluntarily and directing that the question of dissolution be submitted to a regular or special meeting of the members. After the adoption of the resolution to voluntarily dissolve, no receipts shall be accepted nor withdrawals permitted from its share or deposit accounts, nor shall any loans be made nor any dividends declared nor paid pending final determination by its membership on the voluntary dissolution. At a meeting specially called to consider the matter, a majority of the entire membership may vote to dissolve the credit union, provided a copy was mailed to the members of the credit union at least ten (10) days prior thereto. Any member not present at such meeting may, within the next twenty (20) days, vote in favor of or may oppose dissolution by signing a statement in form approved by the department of finance and such vote shall have the force and effect as if cast at such meeting. The credit union shall thereupon immediately cease to do business except for the purposes of liquidation, and the president and secretary shall within five (5) days following such meeting notify the department of finance of intention to liquidate and shall include a list of the names of the directors and officers of the credit union together with their addresses.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c21s26-2142ol12">
       If the department of finance, after issuing notice of suspension and providing opportunity for a hearing, rejects the credit union’s plan to continue operations, the department of finance may issue a notice of involuntary liquidation and appoint a liquidating agent. The credit union may request a stay of execution of such action by appealing to the appropriate court of the jurisdiction in which the credit union is located. Involuntary liquidation may not be ordered prior to following the suspension procedures outlined in this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c21s26-2142ol13">
       The credit union shall continue in existence for the purpose of discharging its debts, collecting and distributing its assets, and doing all acts required in order to wind up its business and may sue and be sued for the purpose of enforcing such debts and obligations until its affairs are fully adjusted. The board or, in the case of involuntary dissolution, the liquidating agent shall apply and distribute the assets of the credit union or the proceeds from any disposition of the assets of the credit union in the following sequence:

       If the credit union shall not be completely liquidated and its assets discharged within three (3) years after the special meeting of the members, the director may take possession of the books, records, and assets and proceed to complete liquidation. If the director determines after one (1) year from the commencement of liquidation proceedings that the liquidation is not proceeding in a reasonable and expeditious manner under all of the circumstances, he may take possession of the books, records, and assets and appoint a liquidating agent who shall give a bond to complete the liquidation.
      </li>

     <p>
      As soon as the board or the liquidating agent determines that all assets from which there is a reasonable expectancy of realization have been liquidated and distributed as set forth in this section, the director shall execute a certificate of dissolution. The credit union shall be subject to examination by and reporting to the department of finance to determine that all procedures have been observed as required by this chapter and shall pay such examination fees as are determined by the department of finance in accordance with its schedules.

      § 26-2148. Duty of credit union service corporation not to discriminate — Burden of proof.

     <p>
      Whenever a credit union, referred to in this section as any “applying credit union” subject to examination by either the department of finance of the state of Idaho, or a federal supervisory agency, applies for a type of credit union services for itself from a credit union service corporation which supplies the same type of credit union services to another credit union, and the applying credit union is competitive with any credit union, referred to in this section as a “stockholding credit union” which holds stock in such corporation, the corporation must offer to supply such services by either:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t26c21s26-2148ol1a">
       Issuing stock to the applying credit union and furnishing credit union services to it on the same basis as to the other credit unions holding stock in the corporation, or
      </li>
      <li id="t26c21s26-2148ol1b">
       Furnishing credit union services to the applying credit union at rates no higher than necessary to fairly reflect the cost of such services, including the reasonable cost of the capital provided to the corporation by its stockholders, at the corporation’s option, unless comparable services at competitive overall cost are available to the applying credit union from another source, or unless the furnishing of the services sought by the applying credit union would be beyond the practical capacity of the corporation. In any action or proceeding to enforce the duty imposed by this section, or for damages for the breach thereof, the burden shall be upon the credit union service corporation to show such availability.

      A credit union may make available for use by its customers one (1) or more electronic devices or machines through which the customer may communicate to the credit union a request to withdraw money either from his account or from a previously authorized line of credit, or an instruction to receive or transfer funds for the customer’s benefit. The device may receive or dispense cash in accordance with such a request or instruction, subject to verification on line or off line by the credit union. Any transactions initiated through such a device shall be subject to verification by the credit union either by direct wire transmission or otherwise. Such facilities may be unmanned or manned.

       The state treasurer shall designate credit unions qualified under this chapter as a state depository or depositories. Such designation shall be determined by competitive bidding or by other means generally accepted as standard business practice. In no case shall the deposit or deposits of state funds in the account of any public entity in any credit union exceed at any one time, the total of the reserves and undivided earnings of such credit union or the total sum covered by share and deposit insurance provided by either the national credit union share insurance fund or by a deposit guarantee corporation authorized to issue share and deposit insurance contracts in this state, whichever sum shall be less.

Such affidavits shall be effective for the purposes of this section, to and including January 31 next following the date of their filing but no longer, and, on or before that date, if such credit union is to continue as a designated state depository under this section, a like affidavit shall be filed in like manner for the succeeding year. No such credit union shall receive deposits from nor act as depository for the funds of the state of Idaho unless and until an affidavit as is herein required and which still continues in effect is on file with the state treasurer in accordance with this section.

       The state treasurer is authorized in his or her discretion and from time to time to negotiate for the payment to designated state depositories of reasonable compensation for services rendered in acting as such depositors. The method and/or rate of such compensation and the terms and conditions thereof shall be fixed by the state treasurer after such negotiation, which may include the calling of bids for specific services. All bids received, whether by a formal bidding process or by negotiation, and the compensation fixed by the treasurer, which shall be in the form of a written agreement, shall be a matter of public record.

       Constitutionality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the requirement of this section that permittees maintain an Idaho office applies evenhandedly to each and every collection agency that may be operating in the State of Idaho and, accordingly, the statutory requirements are not per se unconstitutional as constituting an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. McEldowney, 564 F. Supp. 257 (D. Idaho 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the putative benefit of Idaho’s regulatory scheme under this section outweighs the incidental consequences incurred by collection agencies, and since regulation of commercial debt collection practices is a sufficiently compelling state interest to meet the balancing test required under the commerce clause when a statute is not per se unconstitutional and, consequently, justifies the state’s adopted policy, this section is constitutionally permissible. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. McEldowney, 564 F. Supp. 257 (D. Idaho 1983).
    The interpretation of this section by the director of the department of finance to require that all communications from a permittee collection agency to Idaho debtors, whether by mail or telephone, must emanate from within Idaho interfered with interstate commerce by restricting the permittee to initiating all communication either by letter or by phone intrastate and thus forbidding the permittee company any interstate communications in soliciting creditors’ accounts and such a statutory construction was constitutionally impermissible as a regulation or restriction.

      There is a rebuttable presumption that a person has control of a financial institution or financial institution holding company if the person owns, controls or has the power to vote five percent (5%) of more of the voting securities of the financial institution or financial institution holding company. Owning voting securities in a fiduciary capacity does not constitute “control” unless the director determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the person exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the financial institution or financial institution holding company. No person shall be deemed to have control of a financial institution or financial institution holding company by virtue of the person’s ownership or control of shares acquired by him in connection with his underwriting of shares in the financial institution or financial institution holding company which are held only for such period of time as will permit the sale thereof on an orderly and reasonable basis, and no person shall be deemed to have control of a financial institution or financial institution holding company by virtue of his ownership or control of shares acquired and held in the ordinary course of securing or collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith and which is held only for such period of time as will permit the sale thereof on an orderly and reasonable basis, which period of time shall have a duration of no more than two (2) years.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t26c29s26-2908ol11">
       Each application must be accompanied by a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or such other similar security device, hereinafter referred to as security device, acceptable to the director in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). If the applicant proposes to engage in business under the provisions of this chapter at more than one (1) location, through authorized representatives or otherwise, then the amount of the security device will be increased by five thousand dollars ($5,000) per location, up to a maximum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000). The security device shall be in a form satisfactory to the director and shall run to the state for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission, and payment of money in connection with either the sale and issuance of payment instruments and the transmission of money. In the case of a bond, the aggregate liability of the surety in no event shall exceed the principal sum of the bond. Claimants against the licensee or its authorized representatives may themselves bring suit directly on the security device or the director may bring suit on behalf of such claimants, either in one (1) action or in successive actions. Permissible investments required in section 26-2906, Idaho Code, may be pledged as collateral for the surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or similar security device required in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c29s26-2908ol12">
       In lieu of such security device or of any portion of the principal thereof, as required in this section, the licensee may deposit with the director, or with such banks in this state as the licensee may designate and the director may approve, cash, interest-bearing stocks and bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or guaranteed by the United States, or of this state, or of a city, county, town, school district or instrumentality of this state, or guaranteed by this state, to an aggregate amount, based upon principal amount or market value, whichever is lower, of not less than the amount of the security device or portion thereof. The securities or cash, or both, shall be deposited as aforesaid and held to secure the same obligations as would the security device, but the depositor shall be entitled to receive all interest and dividends thereon, shall have the right, with the approval of the director, to substitute other securities for those deposited, and shall be required to do so on written order of the director made for good cause shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c29s26-2908ol13">
       The security device shall remain in effect until cancellation, which may occur only after thirty (30) days’ written notice to the director. Cancellation shall not affect any liability incurred or accrued during said period.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c29s26-2908ol14">
       The security device or deposit in lieu thereof shall remain in place for a period of two (2) years from the date the licensee ceases money transmission operations in this state. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the director shall permit the security device or deposit in lieu thereof to be reduced or eliminated prior to the expiration of the two (2) year post-cessation period to the extent that the amount of the licensee’s payment instruments outstanding in this state are reduced. The director shall also permit a licensee to substitute a letter of credit or such other form of security device acceptable to the director for the security device, or deposit in lieu thereof, in place at the time the licensee ceases money transmission operations in this state.
    (5) Two (2) years following the cessation of money transmission operations in this state, a former licensee has the option to transfer any funds held to pay outstanding payment instruments to the state tax commission, who shall administer said funds in accordance with chapter 5, title 14, Idaho Code.

The director may conduct an on-site investigation of the applicant, the actual cost of which shall be borne by the applicant. If the director finds that the applicant’s business will be conducted honestly, fairly, and in a manner commanding the confidence and trust of the community, and that the applicant has fulfilled the requirements imposed in this chapter and has paid the required license fee, the director shall issue a license to the applicant authorizing the applicant to engage in the licensed activities in this state for a term of one (1) year.

In the absence of approval or denial of the application, or consent to the extension of the one hundred eighty (180) day period, the application is deemed approved and the director shall issue the license effective as of the first day after the one hundred eighty (180) day or extended period has elapsed.

       For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, discovering unsafe and unsound practices, or securing information lawfully required under this chapter, the director may at any time, either personally or by designee, investigate or examine the business and wherever located, the books, accounts, records, papers, documents, files and other information used in the business of every applicant, licensee or its authorized representatives, and of every person who is engaged in the business of providing money transmission services, whether the person acts or claims to act under or without the authority of this chapter. For these purposes, the director or designated representative shall have free access to the offices and places of business, books, accounts, papers, documents, other information, records, files, safes and vaults of all such persons. The director or the director’s designee may require the attendance of and examine under oath all persons whose testimony may be required about the business or the subject matter of any investigation, examination or hearing and may require such person to produce books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files and any other information the director or designated person declares is relevant to the inquiry. The director may require the production of original books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files and other information; may require that such original books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files and other information be copied; or may make copies himself or herself or by designee of such original books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files or other information. The director or designated person may issue a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum requiring attendance or compelling production of the books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files or other information. Should the director conclude that an on-site examination of a licensee is necessary, the licensee, subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, shall pay all the actual costs of such examination. If the director determines, based on the licensee’s financial statements and past history of operations in the state, that an on-site examination is unnecessary, the on-site examination may be conducted in conjunction with examinations to be performed by representatives of agencies of another state or states. The director, in lieu of an on-site examination, may accept the examination report of an agency of another state, or a report prepared by an independent accounting firm, and reports so accepted are considered for all purposes as an official report of the director.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c29s26-2914ol12">
       In the case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, any court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by the director, may issue to that person an order requiring him to appear before the director or his designee to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence relating to the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court. When the director examines a licensee or an authorized representative within this state, the licensee or authorized representative shall pay all the actual costs of such examination, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).

       The activities of mortgage loan originators and the origination or offering of financing for residential real property have a direct, valuable and immediate impact upon Idaho consumers, Idaho’s economy, the neighborhoods and communities of Idaho, and the housing and real estate industry. The legislature finds that accessibility to mortgage credit is vital to the state’s citizens. The legislature also finds that it is essential for the protection of the citizens of Idaho and the stability of Idaho’s economy that reasonable standards for licensing and regulation of the business practices of mortgage loan originators be imposed. The legislature further finds that the obligations of mortgage loan originators to consumers in connection with originating or making residential mortgage loans are such as to warrant the regulation of the mortgage loan origination process. The purpose of this part is to protect consumers seeking mortgage loans and to ensure that the mortgage industry is operating without unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent practices on the part of mortgage loan originators. Therefore, the legislature establishes within this part an effective system of supervision of mortgage loan originators and enforcement authority, including:

     <p>
      The legislature recognizes that continuing care communities have become an important and necessary alternative for the long-term residential, social and health maintenance needs for many of the state’s elderly citizens.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature finds and declares that tragic consequences can result to citizens of the state when a provider of services under a continuing care agreement becomes insolvent or unable to provide responsible care. The legislature recognizes the need for full disclosure with respect to the terms of agreements between prospective residents and the provider and the operations of such providers. Accordingly, the legislature has determined that these providers should be regulated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter apply equally to for-profit and not-for-profit provider organizations. The provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum requirements to be imposed upon any person, association or organization offering or providing continuing care as set forth in this chapter.
