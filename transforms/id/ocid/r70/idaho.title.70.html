        A port district may formulate all needful regulations for the use by tenants, agents, servants, licensees, invitees, suppliers, passengers, customers, shippers, business visitors and members of the general public, of any properties or facilities owned or operated by it, and request the adoption, amendment or repeal of such regulations as part of the ordinances of the city in which such properties or facilities are situated, or as a part of the resolutions of the county, if such properties or facilities be situated outside any city. The port commission shall make such request by resolution after holding a public hearing on the proposed regulations, notice of which shall be published in a legal newspaper of general circulation in the port district by one (1) publication at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing. In such notice the proposed regulation may be stated in general terms. Such regulations must conform to and be consistent with federal and state law. As to properties or facilities situated within a city, such regulations must conform to and be consistent with the ordinances of the city. As to properties or facilities situated outside any city, such regulations must conform to and be consistent with county ordinances or resolutions. Upon receiving such request, the governing body of the city or county as the case may be, may adopt such regulations as part of its ordinances or resolutions or amend or repeal such regulations in accordance with the terms of the request. Such regulations may be amended or repealed in the same manner as they are adopted. Such regulations shall be compiled and shall be a matter of public record. When any such regulation shall so specify, any violation thereof shall constitute a misdemeanor which shall be redressed in the same manner as other municipal police regulations, and it shall be the duty of all law enforcement officers to enforce such regulations accordingly.

The assessor shall value such facility in the same manner as though it were being valued for the purpose of assessment of ad valorem taxes by the county. The assessor shall certify to the commission the amount of such valuation. The tax collector of such county shall, at the request of the commission, certify the amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been paid by a nonexempt taxpayer upon such valuation in the next preceding tax year, which sum is herein referred to as the “lieu tax.”

The amount of the lieu tax payment shall remain the same during the original term of such lease.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proceeds of the lieu tax payment shall be remitted by the commission, forthwith upon their receipt, to the county tax collector, who shall disburse such proceeds to all taxing bodies and/or agencies receiving general ad valorem tax proceeds in any such year, on the same basis as other ad valorem taxes are disbursed.

       <p>
        Upon any extension of the lease, whether by reason of an option contained in such original lease or otherwise, and upon any re-leasing of such land or facility, the facility shall be again valued and certified by such assessor and the new valuation and lieu tax payment determined by the commission in the same manner, and any such extension or re-leasing shall be subject to the annual payment by the lessee of the new lieu tax figure.
       </p>
       <p>
        All such leases shall be so written that failure of the lessee to pay all such lieu tax moneys prior to the 20th day of December in each year of such lease shall constitute a breach thereof.

        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 57, rewrote the fourth through sixth sentences, which formerly read: “The port auditor shall prepare such financial statements as the port commission shall direct, and not less than once each quarter shall furnish to the port commission a written statement of the receipts and disbursements of the port district for the preceding quarter year, and of all port district funds and accounts, which quarterly statements shall be certified by the port auditor and filed with the county auditor of each of the counties in which the port district is located, and an annual statement shall be filed with the public utilities commission. The annual financial statement of the district, so prepared, shall be published in a newspaper printed within the district, by one (1) insertion thereof, within forty-five (45) days of the end of the port district fiscal year. Such publication shall include a statement that the original of such financial statement is on file, and may be examined at the office of the county treasurer of each county in which the port district, or any part thereof, exists.”

     </h3>
     <p>
      The port commission of any port district may by resolution, from time to time provide for the issuance of funding or refunding revenue bonds to fund or refund any outstanding revenue or other warrants, bonds, and any premiums thereon, and coupons evidencing interest upon any such bonds at or before the maturity or first optional redemption date of such coupons, warrants or bonds, and may combine various outstanding revenue warrants and parts or all of various series and issues of outstanding revenue bonds and matured coupons in the amount thereof to be funded or refunded.
     </p>
     <p>
      The port commission shall create a special fund for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on such funding or refunding revenue bonds, into which fund the commission shall obligate and bind the port district to set aside and pay any part or parts of, or all of, or a fixed proportion of, or a fixed amount of the gross revenue of the port district sufficient to pay such principal and interest as the same shall become due, and if deemed necessary to maintain adequate reserves therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such funding or refunding bonds shall be negotiable instruments within the provisions and intent of the laws of this state, and the tax revenue of the port district may not be used to pay, secure, or guarantee the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The port district may exchange such funding or refunding bonds for the warrants, bonds, and coupons being funded or refunded, or it may sell such funding or refunding bonds in the manner and at such price as the port commission shall deem to be for the best interest of the district and its inhabitants, either at public or private sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this act relating to the terms, conditions, covenants, issuance, and sale of revenue bonds shall be applicable to such funding or refunding bonds except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this section.

     <p>
      The principal, interest and premium, if any, on any revenue bonds issued hereunder shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues and receipts out of which the same shall be made payable and may also be payable out of proceeds from the sale of the project acquired with proceeds of such revenue bonds, but shall not be secured by the full faith and credit or the taxing power of the state of Idaho, any port district or any other political subdivision of the state of Idaho. The resolution under which the revenue bonds are authorized to be issued and any indenture executed as security for the revenue bonds may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the properties covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portions thereof leased by the port district to others, the creation and maintenance of special funds, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, including the designation of a trustee, which may be a bank or trust company, the principal place of business of which may be within or without the state of Idaho, all as the commission shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. The pledge of the revenues and receipts to pay the principal, interest and premium, if any, on revenue bonds issued hereunder shall be valid and binding from the time when the agreement or the proceedings creating such pledge became binding upon the port district. The revenues and receipts so pledged and thereafter received by the port district shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery of any lease, purchase agreement, financing agreement, note, debenture, bond or other obligation pursuant to which such revenues and receipts are payable to the port district, or any other act except that the proceedings or agreement by which such pledge is created shall be recorded in the records of the port district. The proceedings or agreement by which such pledge is created or a financing statement need not be filed or recorded under the uniform commercial code, or otherwise, except in the records of the port district as provided above. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding and shall have priority as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the port district, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Each pledge and agreement made for the benefit or security of any of the revenue bonds issued hereunder shall continue effective until the principal, interest and premium, if any, on the revenue bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid or provision for such payment duly made. In the event of default in such payment or in any agreement of the port district made as a part of the contract under which the revenue bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the revenue bonds or in any indenture executed as security therefor, said payment or agreement may be enforced by suit, mandamus or the appointment of a receiver in equity, or any one or more of said remedies.

      Revenue bonds passed under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the state of Idaho, any port district or any other political subdivision of the state of Idaho, but shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided therefor. The issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall not, directly or indirectly or contingently, obligate the state of Idaho, any port district or any other political subdivision of the state of Idaho to levy any form of taxation therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. Nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize the creation of a debt of the state of Idaho or of the port district authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds within the meaning of the constitution or statutes of the state of Idaho. All revenue bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this act are payable and shall state that they are payable solely from the funds pledged for their payment in accordance with the resolution authorizing their issuance or in any indenture executed as security therefor, and that such revenue bonds are not secured by the full faith and credit or the taxing power of the state of Idaho, any port district or any other political subdivision of the state of Idaho. Neither the state nor the port district authorizing the issuance thereof shall in any event be liable for the payment of the principal, interest or premium, if any, on any such revenue bonds. No breach of any such pledge, obligation or agreement may impose any pecuniary liability upon the state or the port district authorizing the issuance thereof or any charge upon their general credit or against their taxing power.
