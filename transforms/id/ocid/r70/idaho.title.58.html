        The state board of land commissioners cannot act beyond its legislative authority; thus, even if the board had intended to grant mineral rights to those who had obtained reinstatement of contracts to purchase school endowment lands, it had no power to do so and the state would not be bound by the negligent or unlawful acts of its officials.

        Even if a water license had specifically allowed the defendants to construct a fish pond in a navigable estuary, which it did not, the license would not constitute consent of the sovereign to such construction since an agency other than the department of water resources had been vested by statute with authority over the bed of the estuary and the department of water resources consequently had no authority to consent to the construction.

        The trial court’s demarcation of the natural or ordinary high water mark of a portion of a river was supported by the evidence, where the evidence indicated that inundation and water erosion had been severe enough in that area to deprive the soil of its vegetation and destroy its use for agricultural purposes. Heckman Ranches, Inc. v. State, 99 Idaho 793, 589 P.2d 540 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state presented affirmative expert testimony of lines on the soil present at the time of statehood, and plaintiffs presented evidence indicating flooding of homesteaders’ lands lacking specific water levels, plaintiffs did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that a specific line was impressed upon the soil at the level they claimed, and the district court’s judgment in favor of plaintiffs was reversed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The natural or ordinary high water mark of a river refers to a line impressed on the soil by the action of the water and contemplates a vegetation test as an aid in determining its location; thus, in this context, whether the soil is valuable for agricultural purposes refers to the existence of vegetation and the soil’s suitability for raising agricultural crops, and whether cattle could roam on the soil does not aid in determining the location of the natural or ordinary high water mark. Heckman Ranches, Inc. v. State, 99 Idaho 793, 589 P.2d 540 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court applied the correct legal standard in determining the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) when it considered the state’s title to the land below the OHWM as it existed at the time of statehood, and the correct definition of the OHWM pursuant to this section. Erickson v. State, 132 Idaho 208, 970 P.2d 1 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining a lake’s actual high water mark where no evidence can be found which could support a finding of an actual line impressed in the soil on July 3, 1890, the true required finding of fact continues to be simply the “ordinary high water mark,” which may be established by evidence that is unrelated to either soil or vegetation. State Forest Indus., Inc. v. Hayden Lake Watershed Imp. Dist., 135 Idaho 316, 17 P.3d 260 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred when it determined that the ordinary high water mark was 2130 feet above mean sea level since the calculation was not determined by how often the water dropped or rose or whether there was vegetation at a certain place. The district court should have considered the historical facts of the lake in question. City of Coeur d’Alene v. Mackin (In re Ownership of Sanders Beach), 143 Idaho 443, 147 P.3d 75 (2006).

       <p>
        The department of lands acting as the representative of the state land board has the power to dispose of public lands; this power is not absolute, however, and is subject to the limitations imposed by the public trust doctrine. Mere compliance by the department of lands and the state land board with their legislative authority is not sufficient to determine if their actions comport with the requirements of the public trust doctrine.

       </p>
       <p>
        Public trust resources may only be alienated or impaired through open and visible actions, where the public is in fact informed of the proposed action and has substantial opportunity to respond to the proposed action before a final decision is made thereon; moreover, decisions made by nonelected agencies rather than by the legislature itself will be subjected to closer scrutiny than will legislative decisionmaking.

        Final determination whether the alienation or impairment of a public trust resource violates the public trust doctrine will be made by the judiciary; this means that the court will take a “close look” at the action to determine if it complies with the public trust doctrine and it will not act merely as a rubber stamp for agency or legislative action. In making such a determination the court will examine, among other things, such factors as the degree of effect of the project on public trust uses; the impact of the individual project on the public trust resource; the impact of the individual project when examined cumulatively with existing impediments to full use of the public trust resource; the impact of the project on the public trust resource when that resource is examined in light of the primary purpose for which the resource is suited; and the degree to which broad public uses are set aside in favor of more limited or private ones.

       The state land board has a fiduciary responsibility under the public trust doctrine to maintain public access to the submerged lands underlying navigable waterways. Private interests may attempt to claim formerly submerged lands. However, due to the complexity of the legal and factual prerequisites to a claim of title, the board is justified in requiring compensation in the form of a 25-foot public use right-of-way from the party claiming title. This compensation is a settlement of a disputed boundary and does not constitute the taking of private property for a public purpose. The board is acting in a proprietary capacity in compromising a disputed claim to public trust resources.<cite class="OAG">OAG 07-1</cite>.

        The department of lands acting as the representative of the state land board has the power to dispose of public lands; this power is not absolute, however, and is subject to the limitations imposed by the public trust doctrine. Mere compliance by the department of lands and the state land board with their legislative authority is not sufficient to determine if their actions comport with the requirements of the public trust doctrine.

       The state board of land commissioners may at its discretion, when in the state’s best interest, exchange, and do all things necessary to exchange fee simple title to include full surface and mineral rights to any of the state lands now or hereafter held and owned by this state for lands of equal value, public or private, excepting lands that have as their primary value buildings or other structures, unless said buildings or other structures are continually used by a public entity for a public purpose. Land that the state owns known as “cottage sites” can be exchanged for lands of equal value, public or private. As used in this section, an exchange of state lands means a transaction in which the state conveys the land to another party or parties pursuant to an agreement that predates the exchange, in which transaction a party conveying land to the state may be different from a party to whom the state conveyed land. The parties dealing with the state in such an exchange transaction shall not be prohibited from purchasing or selling assets related to accomplishing the transaction before, simultaneously or after said transaction, provided that all such prior and simultaneous purchases and sales are expressly provided for in the exchange agreement.

       Prior to the exchange of any state endowment lands pursuant to this section, the state board of land commissioners shall have an appraisal and review appraisal conducted of the lands it desires to exchange along with an appraisal and a review appraisal of the lands it is proposing to acquire in the exchange. All such appraisals and review appraisals shall be performed by appraisers who are licensed or certificated to perform such work in accordance with chapter 41, title 54, Idaho Code, and who are designated as members of the appraisal institute (MAI). All such appraisals and review appraisals shall conform to the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice (USPAP) standards.

      <li id="t58c01s58-138ol16">
       In determining the fair market value of state endowment lands to be exchanged and acquired pursuant to this section, the state board of land commissioners shall consider all relevant information and circumstances including, but not limited to, the appraisals and review appraisals required by the provisions of subsection (5) of this section and any evidence that enhances or detracts from their reliability.
    (7) Annually on or before January 15 of each year, the state board of land commissioners shall submit a report of all state endowment lands exchanged and acquired and all appraisals and review appraisals conducted pursuant to this section to both houses of the legislature and to the audit division of the legislative services office.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the director of the state department of agriculture determines that there exists the threat of an infestation of grasshoppers, crickets or other similar pests on state-owned land and that the infestation is of such a character as to be a menace to state and adjacent private rangeland or agricultural land, the director of the state department of agriculture may declare the existence of a zone of infestation, and may declare and fix the boundaries so as to definitely describe and identify the zone of infestation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thereupon, the state director of the department of lands or his agent shall have the power to go upon the state-owned land within the zone of infestation and shall cause the insect infestation to be suppressed and eradicated in the manner approved by the state board of land commissioners, using such funds as have been appropriated or may hereafter be made available for such purposes; provided, that whenever the cost of suppression and eradication of grasshoppers, crickets or other similar pests on state-owned lands exceeds the funds appropriated or otherwise available for that purpose, the state board of land commissioners may authorize the issuance of deficiency warrants against the general account [fund] for up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in any one (1) year for such suppression and eradication. The director of the department of lands, in executing the provisions of this chapter insofar as it relates to state-owned lands, shall have the authority to cooperate with federal, county, municipal and private landowners in insect suppression and eradication projects; provided, that the state funds shall only be used to pay the state’s pro rata share based on acreage of state-owned lands treated. Such moneys as the state shall thus become liable for shall be paid as a part of the expenses of the state board of land commissioners out of appropriations which shall be made by the legislature for that purpose.

        “Section 2275. Where settlements with a view to preemption or homestead have been, or shall hereafter be made, before the survey of the lands in the field, which are found to have been made on sections 16 or 36, those sections shall be subject to the claims of such settlers; and if such sections, or either of them, have been or shall be granted, reserved, or pledged for the use of schools or colleges in the state or territory in which they lie, other lands of equal acreage are hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory, in lieu of such as may be thus taken by preemption or homestead settlers. And other lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory where sections 16 or 36 are mineral land, or are included within any Indian, military or other reservation, or are otherwise disposed of by the United States: provided, where any state is entitled to said sections 16 and 36, or where said sections are reserved to any territory, notwithstanding the same may be mineral land or embraced within a military, Indian or other reservation, the selection of such lands in lieu thereof by said state or territory shall be a waiver of its right to said sections. And other lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory to compensate deficiencies for school purposes, where sections 16 or 36 are fractional in quantity, or where one or both are wanting by reason of the township being fractional, or from any natural cause whatever. And it shall be the duty of the secretary of the interior, without awaiting the extension of the public surveys, to ascertain and determine by protraction or otherwise, the number of townships that will be included within such Indian, military, or other reservations, and thereupon the state or territory shall be entitled to select indemnity lands to the extent of two sections for each of said townships in lieu of sections 16 and 36 therein; but such selections may not be made within the boundaries of said reservations: provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any state or territory from awaiting the extinguishment of any such military, Indian or other reservation and the restoration of the lands therein embraced to the public domain and then taking the sections 16 and 36 in place therein; but nothing in this proviso shall be construed as conferring any right not now existing.
    “Section 2276. The lands appropriated by the preceding section shall be selected from any unappropriated, surveyed public land, not mineral in character, within the state or territory where such losses or deficiencies of school sections occur; and where the selections are to compensate for deficiencies of school lands in fractional townships, such selections shall be made in accordance with the following principles of adjustment, to wit: For each township or fractional township, containing a greater quantity of land than three quarters of an entire township, one section; for a fractional township, containing a greater quantity of land than one quarter, and not more than three quarters of a township, three quarters of a section; for a fractional township, containing a greater quantity of land than one quarter, and not more than one half of a township, one half section; and for a fractional township containing a greater quantity of land than one entire section, and not more than one quarter of a township, one quarter section of land: provided, that the states or territories which are or shall be entitled to both the sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections in place, shall have the right to select double the amounts named, to compensate for deficiencies of school land in fractional townships.”

        The two acts compiled in this chapter are a valid and constitutional exercise of the authority conferred on legislature to regulate and prescribe by law the manner and method by which land board may exercise the constitutional powers conferred on such board, whereby it is given the “direction, control and disposition of the public lands of the state,” and is commanded “to provide for the location, protection, sale or rental of all lands heretofore or which may hereafter be granted to the state.” Rogers v.

        The acts authorize not a sale but a simple exchange of lands whereby the state may procure an equivalent area of land to which it can obtain immediate possession. Rogers v. Hawley, 19 Idaho 751, 115 P. 687 (1911).
       </p>

        As the law now stands, it is purely a matter of policy and business expediency on the part of land board as to whether or not it will make any relinquishments or exchange any of these unsurveyed school sections for other lands. With these questions of policy and proprietary interest the courts have nothing to do. Rogers v. Hawley, 19 Idaho 751, 115 P. 687 (1911).

     <p>
      Whenever state land is leased, the director of the department of lands may file with the county recorder of the county in which said land is situated a notice of lien, stating the description of the land, the number of the lease and the name of the lessee, the dates of the execution and expiration of the lease, and that the state claims a lien on any crops grown upon said land for the payment of the rental, during the term of said lease or any extension thereof.

       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, all state lands may be leased for a period of up to twenty-five (25) years to the federal government, to federal agencies, state agencies, counties, or cities, school districts or political subdivisions when leased for public purposes. Such leases for public purposes may be entered into by negotiation and shall secure a rental amount based on the fair market value of the state land.

       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, all state endowment trust lands may be leased for a period of up to thirty-five (35) years for residential purposes as determined by the state board of land commissioners including, but not limited to, single family, recreational cottage site and homesite leases.

       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, all state endowment trust lands may be leased for a period of up to forty-nine (49) years for commercial purposes under such terms and conditions as may be set by the board, provided that, for such leases in excess of twenty (20) years, the board consults with the county commissioners of the county in which the lands are located before leasing the lands, and the use for which the land is leased shall be consistent with the local planning and zoning ordinances insofar as is reasonable and practicable. For each lease in excess of twenty (20) years, the department shall hold a hearing in the county in which the parcel is located.

       The term “commercial purposes” means fuel cells, low impact hydro, wind, geothermal resources, biomass, cogeneration, sun or landfill gas as the principal source of power with a facility capable of generating not less than twenty-five (25) kilowatts of electricity, industrial enterprises, retail sales outlets, business and professional office buildings, hospitality enterprises, commercial recreational activities, multifamily residential developments and other similar businesses. For purposes of this section, farming leases, grazing leases, conservation leases including lands enrolled in federal conservation programs such as the conservation reserve enhancement program (CREP), noncommercial recreation leases, oil and gas leases, mineral leases, communication site leases, single family, recreational cottage site and homesite leases, and leases for other similar uses, are not considered leases for commercial purposes. The terms fuel cells, low impact hydro, wind, geothermal resources, biomass, cogeneration, sun or landfill gas shall have the same definitions as provided in section 63-3622QQ, Idaho Code.

       The board may require that all fixed improvements constructed upon land leased for commercial purposes be removed or become the property of the state upon termination of the lease, and that any heirs, encumbrances or claims of third parties with respect to any improvements shall be expressly subordinate and subject to the rights of the state under this section.

       All applications to lease or to renew an existing lease which expires December 31 of any year, shall be filed in the office of the director of the department of lands by the thirtieth day of April preceding the date of such expiration. Such applications will be considered by the state land board and be disposed of in the manner provided by law; except that the board may reject conflicting applications for a lease for commercial purposes if the lessee exercises the preference right to renew clause, and provided such right is specified in the lease.
    (9) Where conflicts appear upon leases, except for mineral leases which, pursuant to chapter 7, title 47, Idaho Code, contain a preferential right to renew clause, such applications shall be considered as having been filed simultaneously. However, nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the state board of land commissioners from accepting and considering applications for new leases at any time.

     </ol>
     <p>
      (10) In case improvements have been made on land while under lease which is expiring, and the former lessee is not the successful bidder, but the land is leased to another, the amount of such improvements shall be paid to the former lessee. The following shall be considered improvements: plowing done within one (1) year, provided no crop has been raised on the plowed land after such plowing, fencing, buildings, cisterns, wells, growing crops and any other asset which shall be considered an improvement by the director.
     </p>
     <p>
      (11) Commercial leases of the state lands shall not be subject to the conflict auction provisions of section 58-310, Idaho Code. The board may, at its discretion, consider individual applications or call for proposals and sealed bids by public advertisement, and may evaluate said proposals and award the lease to the bidder whose proposal achieves the highest return over the term of the lease and who is capable of meeting such terms and conditions as may be set by the board; in the alternative, the board may call for lease applications by public advertisement and if more than one (1) person files an application to hold an auction in the same manner as provided in section 58-310, Idaho Code. In all cases, the board must obtain a reasonable rental, based upon fair market value of the state land, throughout the duration of the lease. The board may reject any or all proposals and any or all bids, and may reoffer the lease at a later date if the board determines that the proposals or bids do not achieve the highest and best use of the land at market rental.

        This section shows clearly the intent of the legislature to subject only leases for commercial purposes to consultation with the county commissioners and the application of zoning restrictions, which were not made generally applicable to all leases of state endowment lands; as such, mineral leases on endowment lands were immune from local zoning regulations.

       <p>
        Because the 2004 amendment of this section was in effect when adjoining landowners and their wildlife refuge sought an injunction to force state land lessees to comply with local zoning ordinances, the 2004 version, not the 2003 version, of this section applied. Under the 2004 version, the lessees were exempt from conforming to the zoning ordinances because the lease did not exceed ten years. Applying the 2004 amendment of this section did not constitute a retroactive application of the statute because the 2004 change did not affect any vested right of the adjoining landowners, who had no vested right to prevent changes in the use of the state’s property.

      § 58-313. Sale of state land.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state board of land commissioners may at any time direct the sale of any state lands, in such parcels as they shall deem for the best interests of the state. All sales of state lands shall be advertised in four (4) consecutive issues of some weekly newspaper in the county in which the land is situated, if there be such paper, if not, then in some newspaper published in an adjoining county, and in such other paper or papers as the board may direct. The advertisement shall state the time, place and terms of sale, a description of the land and value of the improvements, if any, thereon, and the minimum price per acre of each parcel as fixed by the board, below which no bid shall be received: provided, that sales of state lands shall only be made to citizens of the United States and to those who shall have declared their intentions to become such. If the required sum be not paid forthwith by the highest bidder any lands upon which such payment shall not be made may be immediately reoffered at public sale as before. If any land be sold on which surface improvements have been made by a lessee, or by a former purchaser whose certificate of purchase has for any reason been canceled, said improvements shall be appraised under the direction of the state board of land commissioners. When lands on which improvements have been made, as above, are sold, the purchaser, if other than the owner or former owner of said improvements, shall pay the appraised value of said improvements to the owner thereof, or to the former purchaser who placed the same thereon, taking a receipt therefor, and shall deposit such receipt with the state board of land commissioners before he shall be entitled to a certificate of purchase or patent of said land: provided, the lessee or former owner is not indebted to the state for delinquent rentals or instalment payments on said land. If he is indebted to the state, the value of the improvements shall be credited on his indebtedness and the surplus, if any, be paid to him. All such receipts shall be filed and preserved in the office of said board: provided, that no school lands shall be sold for less than their appraised value nor for less than ten dollars ($10.00) per acre; provided, further, that in the case of the sale of land leased as grazing land and which is too rough, rocky or steep to be reclassified as farming land, the lessee, if he is not the successful bidder, shall be entitled to continue in possession under the lease for a period of two (2) years from the first day of December next occurring after the date of sale at public auction of said land or until expiration of the lease, whichever period shall be shorter. During such period, all rental earned shall belong to the purchaser subject to the following provisions:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t58c03s58-313ol11">
       If the land is sold upon instalment contract to the purchaser, the lessee shall continue to make rental payments to the director of the department of lands and the amount of rental earned after the date of sale shall, when received, be applied against and reduce the principal or interest, or both, payable by the purchaser;
      </li>
      <li id="t58c03s58-313ol12">
       If the purchaser pays the purchase price in full, all rentals earned after the date of sale shall be paid directly to the purchaser. However, no lessee of state lands shall have any right to remain in possession under his lease upon the sale of such state lands for home or cabin site purposes, as provided by the regulations of the state board of land commissioners.

      Whenever the state board of land commissioners shall have determined to direct the sale of state lands in the manner provided in section 58-313, Idaho Code, they shall first give notice in writing by certified mail to the commissioners of the county or counties in which said lands are located of their intention to direct such sale.

From any such order the applicant, the county commissioners in the name of the people of the county concerned, or any person aggrieved by such sale may appeal to the district court of the county in which the land is located for a review of said order. If the court finds such order to be arbitrary, erroneous or capricious, the order of the state board of land commissioners may be set aside and rendered null and void.

Such deed shall be signed by the governor, and countersigned by the secretary of state and by the director and attested with the great seal of the state and the seal of the state board of land commissioners, and said deed shall operate to convey to the purchaser a good and sufficient title in fee simple: provided that the conveyance by said deed shall be subject to reasonable easements for all roads used by the public which exist at the time of sale, unless the county commissioners of the county in which such roads are situated approve the release of such easements and the deed expressly conveys said easements.

If within ninety (90) days after receiving a notice by registered mail from the state land department that the lands are infested with noxious weeds, he does not join such a weed control program the director may request the treatment of such lands by those in charge of the weed control district. When the cost of such treatment has been determined, the supervisor of the weed control district shall send a bill to the purchaser for such eradication of noxious weeds, and if the amount of said bill be not paid within ninety (90) days the state board of land commissioners may declare the contract of sale forfeited and cancel the same, and if the contract is canceled said bill for noxious weed eradication and/or control shall be paid from the state noxious weed control fund appropriated for the treatment of noxious weeds upon state lands.

      § 58-316. Forfeiture of rights of delinquent purchaser — Reinstatement — Disposition of purchase money.
     </h3>
     <p>
      If any purchaser of state land after receiving a certificate of purchase, as provided in this chapter, shall fail to make any of the payments stipulated therein, and the same remains unpaid for thirty (30) days after the time when it should have been paid as specified in such certificate, the director of the department of lands shall, by certified letter addressed to such delinquent purchaser at his last known post-office address, notify such purchaser of such delinquency and of the amount due, and that unless such amount be paid within sixty (60) days after the date of mailing such letter and notice, the board will declare all rights of the purchaser in and to said land forfeited and the certificate and contract relating thereto annulled.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the expiration of said period of sixty (60) days, the state board of land commissioners shall declare such forfeiture, and shall annul said contract and certificate. Such action of the board shall be recorded in the minutes of the proceedings of the board. When such forfeiture shall have been declared and entered in the minutes, as hereinbefore provided, all rights of such purchaser in and to said lands shall be and are extinguished and the state board of land commissioners may sell the land again: provided, that unless other disposition has meanwhile been made of the land, said state board of land commissioners may, upon application of the former purchaser, if such application is made within two (2) years after the certificate has been canceled, reinstate any such canceled certificate upon compliance by the purchaser with such conditions as the board may impose. Such conditions to be imposed by the board shall include the funding of delinquent instalments of principal and interest accrued to the date of reinstatement, by distributing the same in annual payments, to commence with the expiration of the original period covered by the contract of sale, or any extension or extensions thereof, such deferred payments to draw interest from the date of the reinstatement of the certificate; but the board may, in its discretion, impose other conditions, and may, in its discretion, require the payment of such delinquencies in cash at the time of reinstatement. On reinstatement being made the board may, in its discretion, give credit to the purchaser, as for interest paid on his contract, of any amounts which may have been paid by the purchaser as rent of the land during the period of the cancellation of his certificate. Any and all reinstatements of certificates of purchase of state lands heretofore made by the state board of land commissioners are hereby legalized and validated: provided further, that in case of such default and declaration of forfeiture except as provided for in this section, all previous payments made by a purchaser on account of such land shall be forfeited to the state, and the title and right of possession to such land shall be in the state as if no sale had ever been made.

    All purchase moneys arising from the sale of state land shall without delay be paid by the director of the department of lands to the treasurer who shall receipt for the same, and the same shall be credited by the treasurer to the land bank fund to which the land sold belonged. All earnings on such money shall be paid forthwith by the director to the state treasurer and credited by the treasurer to the land bank fund to which the land belonged: provided, that moneys arising from the sale of state land and earnings on those moneys shall be managed by the state board of land commissioners pursuant to section 58-133, Idaho Code; and provided further, that upon the application of any such owner of a certificate of purchase of state land, filed with the director before the expiration of the sixty (60) days limited in said notice, showing by affidavit, or otherwise, that he is unable to pay the amount then due, or that it would work great hardship upon him to be required to make such payment at that time, and stating that he believes he will be unable to make such payment on or before November first of the current year, the state board of land commissioners may extend the time of payment of the amount then due to November first succeeding: provided, that in case of such extension the purchaser shall pay interest on the amount due from January first of the current year to the date of payment at the rate per annum, set by the state board of land commissioners, such interest to be part of the amount payable. Provided, the state board of land commissioners may, in its sole discretion, enter into a supplemental agreement with any owner and holder of a sale certificate on state land, by the terms of which all delinquent payments of principal and interest due on such certificate may be deferred beyond the end of the term of such certificate, or any prior extension thereof, a number of years equal to the period of such delinquency. The said sum so deferred shall draw interest the same as if it were originally a part of the purchase price named in the sale certificate from the date of the supplemental certificate herein referred to until paid. The forms, terms and conditions of such supplemental agreement, and the form of the application therefor, shall be as prescribed by the board. Any such supplemental agreement as herein provided, and any agreement reinstating a canceled certificate, as herein provided, shall be deemed a part of the original sale certificate. History.

     <p>
      The provisions of sections 58-331 through 58-335, Idaho Code, shall not apply to surplus real properties of the Idaho transportation department, with the exclusion of office and maintenance yard sites. The Idaho transportation board shall promulgate rules to govern the sale of surplus real properties under this section, provided that in no case shall a property be sold or exchanged for a value less than that established through the appraisal process; and provided further that surplus real property may be offered for sale or exchange to any tax-supported agency or political subdivision of the state of Idaho, other than the state of Idaho or its agencies, in whose jurisdiction the property is located, at a negotiated price not to exceed the appraised value. Such surplus property sold or exchanged for less than the appraised value must be used in perpetuity exclusively for a public purpose which shall be stated in the deed of transfer. If the stated use shall cease, the property shall revert to the ownership of the Idaho transportation department.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purpose of acquiring highway rights-of-way, the Idaho transportation board is authorized to exchange surplus real property of the department for other parcels of real property. In exchanging real properties, the board shall cause both parcels of real property to be appraised, and either the owner or the department shall pay to the other the difference in value.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before the department disposes of surplus property at public sale, the department shall first notify any person who owns real property which is contiguous with the surplus property of the department that he has first option to purchase the surplus property for an amount not less than the appraised value. If more than one (1) adjoining owner wants to purchase the property, a private auction shall be held for such parties. If no owner of adjoining property exercises his option to buy, the department may proceed to public sale.

If no such objections are interposed within such time by the director of the department of water resources, and no extension of time is granted by the director of the department of lands for him to file such objections, it shall be presumed that there are no objections from his department to the making of such sale. However, if any objections are interposed, the state board of land commissioners shall appoint a time for the hearing of such objections, and shall determine whether or not, said sale should be made.

      § 58-411. Sale of timber.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Timber belonging to the state of Idaho may be sold at public auction by the state board of land commissioners, at their option, as follows: ten percent (10%) of the estimated value of the timber, after deducting the development credits attendant to the sale of the timber, shall be presented as a bid deposit, in a form acceptable to the state, on the day of sale. Ten percent (10%) of the purchase price of the timber, after deducting the development credits attendant to the sale of the timber, shall be due and payable within ten (10) days of the date of sale. This sum shall be retained by the director of the department of lands as a cash reserve for the duration of the sale or the director may, at his discretion, apply all or a portion of the sum as final payment or payments for forest products removed or to satisfy other contractual obligations. The balance of such purchase price shall be paid at such time as the timber is scaled and billed with interest computed from the date of sale to the date of billing at the rate per annum set by the state board of land commissioners. Lump sum sales may be sold for cash at the time of sale or upon such terms and conditions as the state board of land commissioners may prescribe.

        There is a clear distinction between a “possessory right” which is initiated and made good by occupancy and settlement and filing a notice thereof as required by this section, and the right which accrues to a person through the making of a formal homestead or other entry of the land under the laws of the United States, since when the public land is surveyed by the government and filed upon by a qualified entryman in the usual way, it ceases to be public land.

      The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby declares that the public health, interest, safety and welfare requires that all encroachments upon, in or above the beds or waters of navigable lakes of the state be regulated in order that the protection of property, navigation, fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty and water quality be given due consideration and weighed against the navigational or economic necessity or justification for, or benefit to be derived from the proposed encroachment.

        The court would not construe the statute to require that litigation concerning encroachments, which was under way at the time the act became effective, must be transferred from the courts to the state board of land commissioners, even though it would require that all other cases be initiated in the administrative agency rather than the courts.

        Landowners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies when they applied for a permit to build a dock. The lake protection act allowed the Idaho department of lands to determine littoral rights; the landowners were obligated by<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t58c13s58-1305" target="_self">§ 58-1305</a></cite>(b) to either obtain written consent from the adjoining property owners or provide notice of their permit application before the department could issue a permit.

       “Natural or ordinary high water mark” means the high water elevation in a lake over a period of years, uninfluenced by man-made dams or works, at which elevation the water impresses a line on the soil by covering it for sufficient periods to deprive the soil of its vegetation and destroy its value for agricultural purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t58c13s58-1302ol1d">
       “Artificial high water mark” means the high water elevation above the natural or ordinary high water mark resulting from construction of man-made dams or control works and impressing a new and higher vegetation line.

      </li>
      <li id="t58c13s58-1302ol1g">
       “Line of navigability” means a line located at such distance waterward of the low water mark established by the length of existing legally permitted encroachments, water depths waterward of the low water mark, and by other relevant criteria determined by the board when a line has not already been established for the body of water in question.

        The department of lands cannot properly process an application for a navigational encroachment extending beyond the line of navigability, without having first made a determination of a line of navigability that comports with the statutory definition and that is based on substantial evidence.

       <p>
        There was a reasonable basis for concluding that a verdict in a prior litigation determined the littoral boundaries of the properties at issue, collaterally estopping the landowner from relitigating the issue of littoral rights under subsection (f) of this section. The Idaho department of lands adequately weighed the evidence, measuring the impact of an amended encroachment permit against the possible damage to a landowner’s property, and there was nothing improper in the conclusion that the encroachment benefits outweighed the adverse effects on the landowner.

        The inclusion of the word “pilings” in the definition of navigational encroachments was merely illustrative. It is highly unlikely that the legislature intended to define pilings used to support bridges, helipads, and goose nesting boxes as per se navigational. Similarly, the legislature almost certainly did not intend steel pilings driven into a lakebed to be considered “navigational” when such pilings have no specified use relating to navigation and are replacements for wooden pilings that also never had any navigational use. Kaseburg v. State, 154 Idaho 570, 300 P.3d 1058 (2013).

        However it may be applied in any specific case, the phrase “the most unusual of circumstances” in subsection (a) is capable of a reasonable and rational interpretation based on the ordinary meaning of the words; therefore, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. Dupont v. Idaho State Bd. of Land Comm’rs, 134 Idaho 618, 7 P.3d 1095 (2000). Dock Permit.

        The court affirmed the board’s decision to revoke the dock permit issued to the landowner where there was substantial evidence that the proposed area had been a designated swimming area free from boats for forty years. Dupont v. Idaho State Bd. of Land Comm’rs, 134 Idaho 618, 7 P.3d 1095 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the department acted by deciding to hold the dock applications and return the application fees pending a decision in a pending lawsuit, the automatic issuance provisions did not apply, and mandamus was not appropriate. Almgren v. Idaho Dep’t of Lands, 136 Idaho 180, 30 P.3d 958 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Landowners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies when they applied for a permit to build a dock. The lake protection act allowed the department of lands to determine littoral rights; the landowners were obligated by subsection (b) to either obtain written consent from the adjoining property owners or provide notice of their permit application before the department could issue a permit. Lovitt v. Robideaux, 139 Idaho 322, 78 P.3d 389 (2003).

        Under subsection (c) of this section and subsection (c) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t58c13s58-1306" target="_self">§ 58-1306</a></cite>, the district court did not err in restoring the landowners’ applications for dock permits, as their littoral rights were not terminated when the easement extended down to the ordinary high water mark of a navigable lake; the state’s placing of fill along the shoreline did not extinguish the littoral rights.

Applications for installation of buried or submerged water intake lines and utility lines shall be exempt from the newspaper publication process. The board may also furnish copies of the application and accompanying plans to other state agencies having an interest in the lake to determine the opinion of such state agencies as to the likely effect of the proposed encroachment upon adjacent property and lake value factors of navigation, fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty or water quality. Within thirty (30) days following receipt of such copy of the application and plans from the board, such other state agency shall notify the board of its opinion and recommendations, if any, for alternate plans determined by such agency to be economically feasible to accomplish the purpose of the proposed encroachment without adversely affecting unreasonably adjacent property or other lake value factors.

If a hearing is requested, the same shall be held no later than ninety (90) days from the date of filing the application and notice of such hearing shall be given in the manner prescribed for publishing notice of application. The board may, in its discretion, within ten (10) days of filing the application, order a hearing in the first instance in which case, publication of notice of the application shall be dispensed with. All such hearings shall be public and held under rules promulgated by the board under the provisions of chapter 52, title 67 of the Idaho Code. The board shall render a decision within thirty (30) days following conclusion of the hearing and a copy of the board’s decision shall be mailed to the applicant and to each person or agency appearing at the hearing and giving testimony in support of or in opposition to the proposed encroachment. Any applicant or other aggrieved party so appearing at a hearing shall have the right to have the proceedings and decision of the board reviewed by the district court in the county where the encroachment is proposed by filing notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of the board’s decision. If the decision of the board be approval of a permit, the party or parties appealing shall file a bond on such appeal in an amount to be fixed by the court but not less than five hundred dollars ($500) insuring payment to the applicant of damages caused by delay and costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred on the appeal in the event the district court sustains the action of the board.

       In recognition of continuing private property ownership of lands lying between the natural or ordinary high water mark and the artificial high water mark, the board shall consider unreasonable adverse effect upon adjacent property and undue interference with navigation the most important factors to be considered in granting or denying an application for a nonnavigational encroachment, a commercial navigational encroachment, or a community navigational encroachment not extending below the natural or ordinary high water mark. If no objections have been filed to the application and no hearing has been requested or ordered by the board, or, if upon reconsideration of a decision disallowing a permit, or following a hearing, the board determines that the benefits, whether public or private, to be derived from allowing such encroachment exceed its detrimental effects, it shall grant the permit.

        While the Idaho lake protection act contemplates that the Idaho department of lands will weigh the economic benefits and detriments of a proposed navigational encroachment, it is not the only factor considered in the determination. Brett v. Eleventh St. Dockowner’s Ass’n, 141 Idaho 517, 112 P.3d 805 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a reasonable basis for concluding that a verdict in a prior litigation determined the littoral boundaries of the properties at issue, collaterally estopping the landowner from relitigating the issue of littoral rights under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t58c13s58-1302" target="_self">§ 58-1302</a></cite>(f) of the Idaho lake protection act; and, in any event, the Idaho department of lands adequately weighed the evidence, measuring the impact of an amended encroachment permit against the possible damage to and landowner’s property, and there was nothing improper in the conclusion that the encroachment benefits outweighed the adverse effects on the landowner. Brett v. Eleventh St. Dockowner’s Ass’n, 141 Idaho 517, 112 P.3d 805 (2005).
    Under subsection (c) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t58c13s58-1305" target="_self">§ 58-1305 </a></cite>and subsection (c) of this section, the district court did not err in restoring the landowners’ applications for dock permits, as their littoral rights were not terminated when the easement extended down to the ordinary high water mark of a navigable lake; the state’s placing of fill along the shoreline did not extinguish the littoral rights. Lake CDA Invs., LLC v. Idaho Dep’t of Lands, 149 Idaho 274, 233 P.3d 721 (2010).

     <p>
      It is in the interest of all the people of Idaho that the abundant rangeland resources of the counties and the state be properly managed to produce multiple resources and values along with sustained yields of forage and fiber to support the economic welfare of the counties and the state. Because rangeland management, on both public and private lands, is important to each citizen of the state, it is the purpose by the enactment of this chapter to promote the economic and environmental welfare of the counties and the state by providing a means for the collection and dissemination of information and research regarding the management and uses of the county’s and the state’s public and private rangeland resources and the livestock grazing industry.

       There is hereby imposed, as of January 1, of each year, a fee upon owners of dry grazing land within the state of Idaho for the purpose of funding the activities and obligations of the Idaho rangeland resources commission. The fee shall be in the amount of two cents (2¢) per acre of dry grazing land. “Dry grazing land” is that category of land defined by the state tax commission for property tax purposes. No later than the third Monday in July, the county assessor shall provide the Idaho rangeland resources commission, via electronic media, an alphabetic list of the owners of dry grazing land in the county, as shown on the records of the county. The information on dry grazing land shall be provided as follows:

       In addition to the fees imposed in subsection (1) of this section, there is hereby imposed, as of January 1 of each year a fee of ten cents (10¢) per animal unit month on all domestic cattle and sheep utilizing state grazing lands in the state of Idaho. The Idaho department of lands is hereby directed to collect this fee in conjunction with its annual billing for rental of grazing lands and shall remit such collection to the Idaho rangeland resource committee on a monthly basis.

       In addition to the fees imposed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, there is hereby imposed, as of January 1, of each calendar year, a fee of ten cents (10¢) per animal unit month on all domestic cattle and sheep utilizing United States forest service and bureau of land management lands in the state of Idaho if a joint exercise of powers agreement or memorandum of understanding has been entered into authorizing the collection of such a fee. The federal agencies shall, as part of their billing process, include provisions for the collection of this fee and remittance of the fee to the Idaho rangeland resources commission.

       The fee established in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section, shall be a debt of the owner(s), lessee(s) or permittee(s) of the dry grazing land obligated to pay the fee and the fee shall be a debt owed the commission and may be collected by the commission using the normal process to recover a debt.
      </li>
      <li id="t58c14s58-1414Aol15">
       Any person may request from the commission in writing, within thirty (30) calendar days after payment thereof, a refund of all or any portion of an assessment levied hereunder. The commission shall make the refund not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of refund request as long as the commission has received the moneys from the entity collecting the assessment.
    (6) The commission may at its discretion, determine by a majority vote of the commission the minimum fees to be assessed as described in this section. Once such minimum fees have been adopted, the commission shall collect no fee owed pursuant to this section which is equal to or less than the minimum set by the commission. Prior to the adoption of minimum fees by the commission as described in this subsection, the minimum fee owed the commission shall be five dollars ($5.00) for the owners of dry grazing land as described in subsection (1) of this section. There shall be no minimum fee for the assessments described in subsections (2) or (3) of this section unless otherwise determined by the commission.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      An owner of dry grazing land shall not be assessed the fee contained herein if the owner’s or owners’ legal representative signs an affidavit attesting under penalties of perjury that the dry grazing land is not utilized for grazing. The commission shall provide the form and the affidavit shall be filed with the commission prior to the second Monday in July of the current year. The commission shall file a duplicate copy of any affidavit received with the appropriate county assessor.
