        Amendment of Complaint.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, where a wife sued in her individual capacity for damages for the death of her husband who was an employee of a railroad company, when the action should have been brought in the name of the personal representative, the court held that, after the period of limitation had run, she might be granted the right to substitute herself as administratrix, and the plea of the bar of statute of limitation would be overruled, since that would not be the commencement of a new action. Missouri, Kan. & Tex. Ry. v. Wulf, 226 U.S. 570, 33 S. Ct. 135, 57 L. Ed. 355 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        A married woman has such an interest in the cause of action for personal injuries to herself that she may commence and prosecute to a final judgment an action for recovery on account of negligence causing the same, unless objection is made on the ground of the lack of parties; when such an objection is made, a husband may be made a party to such action by amending the complaint and making the husband a party; bringing in of the husband in this manner, after the expiration of the statutory period of limitations, constitutes no new or different cause of action, and the action may, thereafter, be maintained by the husband and wife jointly. Muir v. Pocatello, 36 Idaho 532, 212 P. 345 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an amendment to a pleading introduces a new or different cause of action and makes a new or different demand, the statute of limitations continues to run until the amendment is actually filed. Denton v. Detweiler, 48 Idaho 369, 282 P. 82 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        An amendment to a complaint in an action under the Federal Employees’ Liability Act for personal injuries, continued after his death by his administratrix, alleging the death of the original plaintiff as a result of the injury and demanding a judgment in a single sum for the cause of injury sustained by the deceased during his lifetime, and the pecuniary loss resulting from his death, introduces a new and distinct cause of action and, therefore, does not relate back to the beginning of the action so as to avoid the bar of statute of limitations. B & O.S.W.R.R. v. Carroll, 280 U.S. 491, 50 S. Ct. 182, 74 L. Ed. 566 (1930).

       </p>
       <p>
        The statute does not begin to run against a cestui que trust until the trust is denied or some act is done by the trustee inconsistent with the trust. Nasholds v. McDonell, 6 Idaho 377, 55 P. 894 (1898), overruled on other grounds, Rice v. Rigley, 7 Idaho 115, 61 P. 290 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        When one by his own carelessness or negligence fails to acquire knowledge that is within his reach, the person cannot protect himself behind the plea that he did not know the facts. Coe v. Sloan, 16 Idaho 49, 100 P. 354 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        An express trust as well as an implied one is repudiated by adverse possession and the statutes of limitation begin to run from time of such repudiation. Coe v. Sloan, 16 Idaho 49, 100 P. 354 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is no fraud shown, neither the ignorance of the person of the right to bring an action nor the mere silence of the person liable to the action will prevent the running of the statute of limitations. Coe v. Sloan, 16 Idaho 49, 100 P. 354 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the fact of death is established by the presumption arising from seven years’ unexplained absence of a person, a cause of action on a benefit certificate payable upon the death of such person does not accrue until the end of the seven-year period of disappearance.

        Right of action on absolute contract of guaranty accrues immediately upon the breach of the obligation guaranteed. Rawleigh Medical Co. v. Atwater, 33 Idaho 399, 195 P. 545 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where contract contains acceleration clause positive in terms, default under such clause renders entire indebtedness due and statute runs from such default. Perkins v. Swain, 35 Idaho 485, 207 P. 585 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of limitations does not begin to run against an action based upon fraud until the plaintiff in the exercise of proper diligence discovers the facts constituting the fraud. Ryan v. Old Veteran Mining Co., 37 Idaho 625, 218 P. 381 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute does not begin to run against voluntary, continuing trust obligation, resting in parol, until the trustee begins to act in hostility to the obligation, and knowledge of the repudiation is brought home to the cestui que trust. Davenport v. Bird, 45 Idaho 280, 261 P. 769 (1927); Brasch v. Brasch, 55 Idaho 777, 47 P.2d 676 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        If holder of a municipal warrant issued under a contract relation has a remedy which he may pursue at the time of its issuance, the statute of limitations begins to run then, but if he has no remedy at that time, it begins to run when his remedy thereafter accrues. Little v. Emmett Irrigation Dist., 45 Idaho 485, 263 P. 40 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an indefinite delay in making demand for performance is contemplated by the terms of the contract, the period of the statutes of limitation will not be held to be the measure of time in which demands should be made. Johnston v. Keefer, 48 Idaho 42, 280 P. 324 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where obstructions placed in defendant’s dam caused periodic flooding of plaintiff’s land, statute of limitations began to run from date of each periodic overflowing. Lavin v. Panhandle Lumber Co., 51 Idaho 1, 1 P.2d 186 (1931).

       <p>
        Where a foreign object is negligently left in a patient’s body by his physician and the patient is in ignorance of the fact and consequently of his right of action for malpractice, the cause of action does not accrue until the patient learns of, or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have learned of, the presence of such foreign object in his body. Billings v. Sisters of Mercy, 86 Idaho 485, 389 P.2d 224 (1964).

        A court of equity is not bound to apply statute of limitations if it works an injustice to the creditor, and unusual conditions or extraordinary circumstances make it inequitable. Cummings v. Langroise, 36 F. Supp. 174 (D. Idaho 1940), aff’d 123 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 664, 62 S. Ct. 944, 86 L. Ed. 1741 (1942).

        Where the plaintiff who had loaned decedent large sums of money under circumstances, and at times, when it was greatly needed in the preservation of the decedent’s estate, to support himself, and for the payment of numerous large counsel fees, and upon decedent’s death, the plaintiff brought action for the amount of the loans and sought the enforcement of a lien on the interest of the decedent in an estate, a federal district court sitting as a court of equity would not adjudge that recovery was barred by the five-year statute of limitations even if it could properly do so. Cummings v. Langroise, 36 F. Supp. 174 (D. Idaho 1940), aff’d 123 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 664, 62 S. Ct. 944, 86 L. Ed. 1741 (1942).

        Legal malpractice action was barred by a two-year statute of limitations because “some damage” occurred when property was transferred to a trust to gain a tax advantage since two clients could have reformed the trust at that time to correct any defects; therefore, a district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of several lawyers.

        Where a patient eventually lost her sight after cataract surgery in October 1999, the only issue of negligence presented concerned the doctor’s post-operative care. The patient’s claim could not have accrued before the first incident of alleged malpractice, which was on November 12, 1999. The patient filed her request for a prelitigation screening panel on November 8, 2001, less than two years after the alleged act of malpractice, so her claim was not barred by the statute of limitations.

        Adverse Possession.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Title by adverse possession cannot be acquired against the state; this section does not bar suit by state to recover lands reserved for, or dedicated to, some public use, such as school land. Hellerud v. Hauck, 52 Idaho 226, 13 P.2d 1099 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Church’s occupation of state land held under certificate of purchase, prior to full payment of the purchase price by the certificate holder, is an unlawful possession of state land upon which no claim of adverse possession can be based. Hellerud v. Hauck, 52 Idaho 226, 13 P.2d 1099 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are certain categories of state-owned land which are immune from acquisition by adverse possession; the court having previously held that there are two such categories — land dedicated to a public use and school endowment land; however, the former bed of a navigable river which changed its course falls in no immune category. Rutledge v. State, 94 Idaho 121, 482 P.2d 515 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the reason for holding property in trust for the public benefit ceases, it is no longer a unique or special benefit to the general public; and the reasons for clothing such property with a protective shield of immunity from acquisition by adverse possession also became meaningless. Rutledge v. State, 94 Idaho 121, 482 P.2d 515 (1971).

        Statute begins to run against a grantee of the state only from the time he acquires title, and any occupancy prior to that time will not be deemed possession against the state. Hellerud v. Hauck, 52 Idaho 226, 13 P.2d 1099 (1932).

        Where an administrator’s payments of interest on mortgage indebtedness were approved by the probate court and the administrator’s account, including the final account, acknowledged liability on the note and mortgage, the order settling the final account and distributing the realty involved subject to the lien of the mortgage, which order was permitted to become final by a lapse of time, was conclusive on the validity of the mortgage and could not be collaterally attacked on the ground that the note and mortgage were barred by the statute of limitations.

       </h5>
       <p>
        By the execution and delivery of a deed of land the entire legal title in the premises vests in the grantee, and if the grantor continues in possession afterward, his possession will be that of either a tenant or trustee of the grantee and he will be regarded as holding the premises in subserviency to the grantee and nothing short of an explicit disclaimer of such relation and a notorious assertion of right in himself will be sufficient to change the character of his possession and render it adverse to the grantee. Trask v. Success Mining Co., 28 Idaho 483, 155 P. 288 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        One who establishes his legal title to real estate is presumed to have been possessed of the property within the meaning of this statute, and its occupation by another is deemed to have been in subordination to the legal title, unless it appears that it has been held and possessed adversely to such legal title for five [now 20] years; and where there is no proof showing that actual occupation was accompanied by a claim, or an intention, inconsistent with the title of the owner, an adverse claim based upon such occupation cannot be allowed. Bower v. Kollmeyer, 31 Idaho 712, 175 P. 964 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uninterrupted and continuous possession for the prescriptive period raises the presumption that it was adverse and under claim of right. Bachman v. Reynolds Irrigation Dist., 56 Idaho 507, 55 P.2d 1314 (1936); Northwestern & Pac. Hypotheekbank v. Hobson, 59 Idaho 119, 80 P.2d 793 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the owner of the property fails to eject the trespasser or enjoin the unauthorized use, after five [now 20] years his right to do so will be barred as against those who had actually made open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted use, under a claim of right, with the knowledge of the owner, for the five [now 20] year period, but those persons who had not made such use could be enjoined from further interfering with the owner’s superior rights. State ex rel. Haman v. Fox, 100 Idaho 140, 594 P.2d 1093 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to quiet title where the evidence showed that two parcels, which were part of a boundary dispute, were farmed as one field, either by a tenant who rented both parcels or by the owner of one parcel who rented the other, there was no showing of an open, hostile use for the full prescriptive period. Nelson v. Wagner, 108 Idaho 570, 700 P.2d 973 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any claim of title under an adverse possession theory involves a showing of adverse use. Christle v. Scott, 110 Idaho 829, 718 P.2d 1267 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no evidence is presented to establish how the use of a servient estate began, a presumption arises that the use is adverse and under claim of right; the owner of the servient estate must then rebut that presumption by showing the use is permissive or by virtue of a license, contract or agreement. Christle v. Scott, 110 Idaho 829, 718 P.2d 1267 (Ct. App. 1986).
    Where the claimant of a prescriptive easement testified that he originally thought there was a recorded easement across the land, he had never thought he was using the road in derogation of anyone’s rights, he never thought that he was in any way trespassing on the property, and his use had never interfered in any way with anyone else’s use of the property, the evidence supported a finding of permissive use. Christle v. Scott, 110 Idaho 829, 718 P.2d 1267 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A use initiated with permission may ripen into a prescriptive easement where the permission is later repudiated or revoked. Branson v. Miracle, 111 Idaho 933, 729 P.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, proof of open, notorious, uninterrupted use for the prescriptive period of five [now 20] years raises a presumption that the use was adverse. Branson v. Miracle, 111 Idaho 933, 729 P.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that proof of open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted use of the claimed right for the prescriptive period, without evidence as to how the use began, raises the presumption that the use was adverse and under a claim of right. Lemhi Cty. v. Moulton, 163 Idaho 404, 414 P.3d 226 (2018).

        Claimant of a prescriptive easement can rely on the adverse use by the claimant’s predecessor for the prescriptive period or the claimant may couple such predecessor’s use with the claimant’s own use to establish the requisite five [now 20] continuous years of adverse use; and, in the absence of any evidence indicating how the predecessor’s use began, the claimant may invoke a rebuttable presumption that the use was adverse and under a claim of right as against the servient landowner; absent evidence to rebut the presumption, the claimant is entitled to rely on the presumption of adversity.

        Where, from the evidence, the trial court found that the driveway involved, a strip of land 10 feet wide along the boundary between lots owned by the respective parties, was used in common by the parties and their predecessors for parking, for access to garages and for taking fuel into basement apertures of the adjoining homes for a period of 21 years, and that such mutual use was not merely permissive but was such as would ripen into an easement by prescription and in fact into reciprocal and equal rights in the adjoining owners, such finding will not be disturbed on appeal.

        Where a roadway across a parcel of land had been used since the early 1930’s to provide access to adjoining property which was used for a single-family residence and for farming purposes until 1970, a prescriptive easement for such uses was established but such easement would not be expanded to include an increase in use caused by construction of a business and other residences after 1970, since this increased use had not continued for five years at the time the action was instituted.

        Use of a driveway in common with the owner and the general public, in the absence of some decisive act on the user’s part indicating a separate and exclusive use on his part, negatives any presumption of individual right therein in his favor.

        Use of a roadway must invade or infringe on the owner’s rights in order for the use to be considered adverse and, thus, to ripen into a prescriptive right of way. Marshall v. Blair, 130 Idaho 675, 946 P.2d 975 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a claim for a prescriptive easement, the trial court erred in finding permissive use, as uncontradicted testimony revealed that the claimant’s use was without permission and the property owner knew of the use but never acted to curtail the usage, and there was no finding by the trial court that this testimony was not credible. Wood v. Hoglund, 131 Idaho 700, 963 P.2d 383 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendants inspected the land prior to their purchase and observed the trails on the land, the testimony in the record merely established that the defendants were aware of the trails at the time of purchase, and the mere appreciation of the abundant trails, without more, was insufficient to establish that the defendants were put on notice of a prescriptive easement across their land. Baxter v. Craney, 135 Idaho 166, 16 P.3d 263 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff’s testimony that he used a portion of the defendant’s land to access his back yard for debris removal, and to travel to his parents’ house, did not establish a prescriptive easement where the court found contradictory testimony more credible.

       </p>
       <p>
        One plaintiff landowner’s predecessor had maintained the road which ran across defendant landowner’s property, and that maintenance was sufficient for tacking under this section, if, on remand, the trial court made findings as to that predecessor’s use of defendants’ property; but it was error to find that maintenance was sufficient to rebut a presumption of permissive use without evidence that defendants or their predecessors refused to participate in a maintenance association established by the several plaintiff landowners. Hodgins v. Sales, 139 Idaho 225, 76 P.3d 969 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of prescriptive easement claim was affirmed because the district court properly concluded that the first neighbor used the path along with the general public and performed no independent act that would have put the owner on notice the first neighbor was claiming a prescriptive easement over his land.

       </p>
       <p>
        Factual findings supported a district court’s conclusion that the claimants’ use of a road was open and notorious, continuous and uninterrupted, with the actual knowledge of adjoining landowners, and for the five-year [now 20-year] statutory period. The claimants, thus, acquired a prescriptive easement against adjoining landowners. Beckstead v. Price, 146 Idaho 57, 190 P.3d 876 (2008).

        A party seeking to establish the existence of an easement by prescription must prove by clear and convincing evidence that use of the subject property was: (1) open and notorious, (2) continuous and uninterrupted, (3) adverse and under a claim of right, (4) with the actual or imputed knowledge of the owner of the servient tenement, and (5) for the statutory period.

        Where the fence was not on the true surveyed boundary between the properties, but the evidence indicated that the fence’s location was a matter of convenience, winding and meandering according to the lay of the land, and it was used as a livestock fence rather than as a boundary fence, there was no evidence of adverse possession.

        When reviewing a district court’s determination that a private prescriptive easement exists, the supreme court must determine whether the district court properly applied the legal requirements for a prescriptive easement to the facts that the district court found. Marshall v. Blair, 130 Idaho 675, 946 P.2d 975 (1997).
    Where the plaintiff in a suit against a canal company to quiet title to land and water rights did not plead the company claimed maintenance liens were barred by the two year statute of limitations, and the statutory period for foreclosure of the 1935 liens had not expired when the quiet title suit was filed, the plaintiff was confined to its remedy in collateral suits which had been brought in the state court by the company to foreclose liens. North Side Canal Co. v. Idaho Farms Co., 109 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to quiet title, evidence that the plaintiff had held the land under color of title for more than the prescriptive period justifies the finding in his favor. Stickel v. Carter, 63 Idaho 78, 117 P.2d 477 (9th Cir. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where purchasers of tax title for unpaid 1932 taxes entered into possession in 1933 and instituted quiet title suit which was decided in 1950 adversely to tax title purchasers and in favor of property owners, which decree was affirmed on appeal, and daughter of tax title purchasers instituted quiet title proceeding in 1951 pending appeal of prior case, the property owners though out of actual possession were in constructive possession of property since they had established legal title to property at the time daughter’s suit was instituted. Salvis v. Lawyer, 73 Idaho 469, 253 P.2d 589 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant’s predecessor in title for a period of 40 years claimed disputed area south of original boundary fence by cultivating crops within disputed area, a claim by plaintiff’s predecessor in title to disputed area on the ground that original boundary fence included some of his land, and statement by defendant that original boundary fence was probably not correct, did not prevent plaintiff’s action to quiet title to disputed area from being barred by five year limitation period. Beneficial Life Ins. Co. v. Wakamatsu, 75 Idaho 232, 270 P.2d 830 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff, in suit to quiet title, is not relying on an oral contract for the conveyance of real property and is the holder of the legal title and defendant does not establish adverse possession, the defense of limitations under the statute is not established. Dickerson v. Brewster, 88 Idaho 330, 399 P.2d 407 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where less than five years had elapsed between defendants’ contract of purchase and subsequent purchaser plaintiff’s bringing of an action to quiet title, no easement by prescription could have arisen during that time. Fajen v. Powlus, 96 Idaho 625, 533 P.2d 746 (1975) (now 20 years).

       </p>
       <p>
        Prima facie showing of legal title raises a presumption of seizin and possession for period of five years. Beneficial Life Ins. Co. v. Wakamatsu, 75 Idaho 232, 270 P.2d 830 (1954) (now 20 years).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affirmative defenses of mutual agreement and long acquiescence in fence boundary, and adverse possession included defense of five year limitation period, since affirmative defenses pleaded were inconsistent with seizin and possession of disputed area by plaintiff.

        Express trusts are not within the operation of the statute of limitations, but trusts which arise from an implication of law or constructive trusts are within the operation of the statute. Ames v. Howes, 13 Idaho 756, 93 P. 35 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        An express, as well as an implied, trust is repudiated by adverse possession, and the statute of limitations begins to run from the time the beneficiary has notice of such repudiation. Coe v. Sloan, 16 Idaho 49, 100 P. 354 (1909); Olympia Mining & Milling Co. v. Kerns, 24 Idaho 481, 135 P. 255 (1913), appeal dismissed, 236 U.S. 211, 35 S. Ct. 415, 59 L. Ed. 542 (1915).

        Unimproved Land.

       <p>
        Where land over which prescription was claimed was unimproved until 1961 the general rule that open, notorious, continued and uninterrupted use for the prescriptive period without explanation of how it began raises a presumption that it was an adverse use and under a claim of right was not applicable, it applying only to improved lands. Trunnell v. Ward, 86 Idaho 555, 389 P.2d 221 (1964).
       </p>

        If the lands of the servient estate are wild, unenclosed, or unimproved, it is presumed that the use is permissive. Christle v. Scott, 110 Idaho 829, 718 P.2d 1267 (Ct. App. 1986).

        Before adverse possession by one tenant in common against another can begin, the one in possession must, by the acts of the most open and notorious character, clearly show to the world, and to all having occasion to observe the condition and occupancy of the property, that his possession is intended to exclude and does exclude the rights of his cotenant. Vaughan v. Hollingsworth, 35 Idaho 722, 208 P. 838 (1922).

        An adverse right is not originated by consent but rather against the will and without consent of the true owner, and generally rests on an original trespass, which matures into a property right by reason of the true owner allowing the claimant or trespasser to continue the adverse use and possession uninterruptedly and with assertion of right until the statutory period has run, which bars the true owner from either asserting or defending his right to the property.

       <p>
        Where record failed to indicate the trustee or the contingent remaindermen had any notice that the cestui que trust was holding adversely to their respective interests, quiet title action failed for lack of proof of occupying the land adversely for the requisite five-year period. Robertson v. Swayne, 85 Idaho 239, 378 P.2d 195 (1963) (now 20 year period, following 2006 amendment). Adverse Possession.
       </p>
       <p>
        Enclosure by fence of strip of land for period of 8 years established title by adverse possession, even though owner was away from vicinity for six years, since owner does not have to have notice or knowledge of adverse possession, if possession of claimant is open and notorious under claim of title. Calkins v. Kousouros, 72 Idaho 150, 237 P.2d 1053 (1951) (now 20 year period, following 2006 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Enclosure and exclusive possession of disputed land by claimant prevails, even though claimant and true owner are mistaken as to exact lines covered by their deeds. Calkins v. Kousouros, 72 Idaho 150, 237 P.2d 1053 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Party claiming title by adverse possession through enclosure of disputed property by fence does not admit title of the other by offering to buy disputed property. Calkins v. Kousouros, 72 Idaho 150, 237 P.2d 1053 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action by plaintiffs to quiet title to house and lot in 1951, the defendants who entered into possession of property under a deed in 1933 and who remained in possession thereafter either in person or by renters were owners of property by adverse possession and color of title. Obermeyer v. Idohl, 76 Idaho 103, 278 P.2d 188 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commencement of action by plaintiff to quiet title filed 30 days prior to end of five year period of adverse possession asserted by defendant interrupted the period of defendant’s adverse possession, and the rights of the defendant as against the plaintiff must be determined as of the filing date. Smith v. Long, 76 Idaho 265, 281 P.2d 483 (1955) (now 20 year period, following 2006 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Running of the period of adverse possession was not suspended as to the interests of minors during their minority where the title of such minors was held in trust for them by a court-appointed trustee. Jones v. State, 91 Idaho 823, 432 P.2d 420 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        A survey subsequent to entering into possession cannot be used as a basis for adverse possession under written claim. Standall v. Teater, 96 Idaho 152, 525 P.2d 347 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence indicated that the adverse claimants had built a garage and placed a mobile home on the property, that their predecessor had rented trailer spaces on the land over a continuous period exceeding five years, that the claimants built a shop and that the predecessor poured gravel on the property in the trailer parking area, that the claimants’ possession and improvement of the property extended over a period of approximately four years, nine months, and that their predecessor occupied or used the property for seven years, the evidence supported the trial court’s findings both that the property had been “improved,” and that it had been put to “the ordinary use of the occupant,” as denoted in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-208" target="_blank">§ 5-208</a></cite>, over a continuous period of five years. Gage v. Davis, 104 Idaho 48, 655 P.2d 942 (Ct. App. 1982) (now 20 year period, following 2006 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonprofit corporation which supplied water to mobile home park asserted its claim to well lots under adverse possession pursuant to a written claim and/or an oral claim of right. However, the plaintiff’s use of the well lots could have been consistent with use by permission rather than adverse possession. As a result, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the corporation. East Lizard Butte Water Corp. v. Howell, 122 Idaho 679, 837 P.2d 805 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides that a party must possess property under color of title for five years to claim title by adverse possession. Rice v. Hill City Stock Yards Co., 121 Idaho 576, 826 P.2d 1288 (1992) (now 20 year period, following 2006 amendment).
    Where common driveway thirteen to twenty-one feet in width was maintained within a thirty-foot easement originally granted, improvements constructed by landowners which interfered with the thirty-foot easement were not adverse and party’s right to full width of the easement had not been extinguished because a need to actually utilize the unused portion of the easement had not yet arisen; judgment in favor of party’s right to full width of easement was upheld. Winn v. Eaton, 128 Idaho 670, 917 P.2d 1310 (Ct. App. 1996).

        Where grantor, in selling the land to the plaintiff, indicated that the fence in place was the boundary line, and nothing was said about any arrangement to change the fence, the plaintiff established title of all the land up to the fence by adverse possession. Mulder v. Stands, 71 Idaho 22, 225 P.2d 463 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a boundary is established by agreement, followed by acquiescence and possession, and particularly possession for the full statutory period for establishing title by prescription, the line thus established determines the location of the estate and establishes the true line or division.

        Even though a mayor has no authority to make a deed to a city street, still his deed gives to the grantee color of title. Boise City v. Wilkinson, 16 Idaho 150, 102 P. 148 (1909).

        Respondent’s uninterrupted and continuous use of the East Ditch for more than the prescriptive period raises the presumption that his use was adverse and under a claim of right and there was no evidence to overcome this presumption; therefore, respondent acquired and was the owner of an easement or right of way for the flow of his full head of 60 miners inches of water in and through the East Ditch, even though his 80 shares of stock in the canal company evidenced a water right appurtenant to his land of 50 miners inches of water.

        Respondent’s uninterrupted and continuous use of the East Ditch for more than the prescriptive period raises the presumption that his use was adverse and under a claim of right and there was no evidence to overcome this presumption; therefore, respondent acquired and was the owner of an easement or right of way for the flow of his full head of 60 miners inches of water in and through the East Ditch, even though his 80 shares of stock in the canal company evidenced a water right appurtenant to his land of 50 miners inches of water. Ramseyer v. Jamerson, 78 Idaho 504, 305 P.2d 1088 (1957).
    In general, a party asserting adverse possession under an oral claim of title must prove by clear and satisfactory evidence that he or she has been in possession of the property for the prescriptive period, and that the possession has been actual, open, visible, notorious, continuous, and hostile to the party against whom the claim of adverse possession is made. Shelton v. Boydstun Beach Ass’n, 102 Idaho 818, 641 P.2d 1005 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When applied to extinguishment of an easement, the elements of exclusivity and hostility require that the land owner use the property within the easement in a manner wholly inconsistent with enjoyment of the easement. Shelton v. Boydstun Beach Ass’n, 102 Idaho 818, 641 P.2d 1005 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that the owners of the servient beach premises constructed retaining wall, erected fences around their property, and planted grass and flowers within the easement, the trial court’s finding that the improvements by the servient owners were inconsistent with the express purposes of boating, bathing, driving and parking set forth in the grant of easement was supported by substantial and competent evidence and, thus, permitted the court’s judgment extinguishing that portion of the easement which had been enclosed and improved. Shelton v. Boydstun Beach Ass’n, 102 Idaho 818, 641 P.2d 1005 (Ct. App. 1982).

       <p>
        Nonprofit corporation which supplied water to mobile home park asserted its claim to well lots under adverse possession pursuant to a written claim and/or an oral claim of right. However, the plaintiff’s use of the well lots could have been consistent with use by permission rather than adverse possession. As a result, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the corporation. East Lizard Butte Water Corp. v. Howell, 122 Idaho 679, 837 P.2d 805 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant’s argument that he need only establish adverse possession as against original owner of land in his quiet title action was wholly without merit because action was also filed against “all unknown claimants” and county was an unknown claimant and ownership must, therefore, be proven against the county as against original owner. Cluff v. Bonner County, 126 Idaho 950, 895 P.2d 551 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there was evidence to the contrary, where the district judge was in the best position to determine the credibility of witnesses whose evidence demonstrated a shared maintenance of property, the finding that adverse possession by the plaintiffs was not established was affirmed.

        In an action to have title quieted in the plaintiffs and to have a fence located between the parties’ respective residences declared the boundary line, where location of the true boundary was known and where an oral agreement to fix another line as the boundary established only a right of permissive use in the plaintiffs, plaintiffs’ actions of erecting a fence and maintaining and cultivating the lawn, which did not constitute notice of hostile possession since done with the owner’s consent, were insufficient to commence running of the statute of limitations and to establish title through adverse possession.

        Where a purchaser of a right-of-way for a ditch across a tract of land has failed to record its conveyance prior to the record of a subsequent conveyance made in good faith, and in an action to quiet title seeks to recover on the grounds of adverse possession for the statutory period, the extent of the right-of-way or easement must be determined by the facts proven as to the extent of the use and occupation, and can not be determined by the calls of such unrecorded deed.

        Where common driveway thirteen to twenty-one feet in width was maintained within a thirty-foot easement originally granted, improvements constructed by landowners which interfered with the thirty-foot easement were not adverse and party’s right to full width of the easement had not been extinguished because a need to actually utilize the unused portion of the easement had not yet arisen; judgment in favor of party’s right to full width of easement was upheld.

       </p>
       <p>
        Enclosure by fence of strip of land for period of eight years established title by adverse possession, even though owner was away from vicinity for six years, since owner does not have to have notice or knowledge of adverse possession, if possession of claimant is open and notorious under claim of title. Calkins v. Kousouros, 72 Idaho 150, 237 P.2d 1053 (1951) (now 20 year requirement).

       <p>
        Fact that respondents and their predecessors possessed the disputed property by enclosure, exclusive use and payment of taxes constituted adverse possession, although the possession, was authorized by oral agreement. Lisher v. Krasselt, 94 Idaho 513, 492 P.2d 52 (1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of trial court that claimant of strip of land by adverse possession had paid all taxes levied and assessed against land was technically incorrect where evidence showed that no taxes were ever levied against the land, but finding was sufficient to cover favorable finding on matter of taxes in favor of claimant.

       <p>
        Finding of trial court that possession of party claiming title to strip of land by adverse possession was adverse and hostile was not overcome by evidence that claimant had made some inquiry as to ownership of disputed land at office of assessor. Hogan v. Blakney, 73 Idaho 274, 251 P.2d 209 (1952).
    Evidence that a driveway was used uninterruptedly and continuously for more than the prescriptive period, would raise a presumption that such use was adverse and under claim of right, especially since there was not sufficient evidence to overcome such presumption; in fact, evidence being given of improvements to the driveway being made, it being surfaced with concrete, which would support the contention that the use was not merely permissive.

       <p>
        Person claiming title to property by adverse possession has the burden of showing that the possession of disputed property was hostile to that of the real owner, and not with the permission of the real owner since occupation without hostile intent does not constitute adverse possession; if the initial entry of the adverse claimant upon the disputed land was with the permission of the record owner, the statute of limitation will not begin to run against the true owner until the adverse claimant establishes exclusive right in himself; and once it has been established that an adverse claimant’s initial entry upon disputed land was with the permission of the record owner, only an unequivocal act by the permissive user brought home to the true owner will start the running of the statute of limitations. Berg v. Fairman, 107 Idaho 441, 690 P.2d 896 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where adverse claimant’s predecessors in title to the disputed part of lot were her mother and father and her brother, she was faced with the presumption that their occupation was permissive since they were blood relatives; thus, in action to quiet title in part of lot some unequivocal act indicating occupier’s intent to claim adversely had to be shown to change the character of the use from permissive to adverse.

        In an action to quiet title based on adverse possession, if those who caused warehouse to be located on the land believed that it was standing on leased property, the act of plaintiff’s predecessors in interest in occupying the land was not an assertion of title in themselves so as to support a claim for adverse possession.

        Where claimant’s predecessors in title to disputed land were blood relatives she was faced with a presumption of law that the occupation of the disputed strip was permissive and, therefore, it was incumbent upon her to, by affidavit or otherwise, oppose the motion for summary judgment setting forth specific facts that would controvert the presumption of permissive occupation; where the record was devoid of any specific facts controverting the presumption, summary judgment in action to quiet title was proper.

      Provided, however, that in no case shall adverse possession be considered established under the provisions of any sections of this code unless it shall be shown that the land has been occupied and claimed for the period of twenty (20) years continuously, and the party or persons, their predecessors and grantors, have paid all the taxes, state, county or municipal, which have been levied and assessed upon such land according to law. Provided further, that adverse possession shall not be considered established under the provisions of any sections of this code if a written instrument has been recorded in the real estate records kept by the county recorder of the county in which the property is located and such written instrument declares that it was not the intent of a party to such instrument, by permitting possession or occupation of real property, to thereby define property boundaries or ownership. Provided further, that for purposes of establishing adverse possession pursuant to this section, a person claiming adverse possession must present clear and convincing evidence that the requirements of subsection (1) or (2) of this section have been met.

       <p>
        Because an adverse possessor does not acquire any interest in the real property adversely possessed until all of the requirements of this section have been met, the adverse possessor does not have a cause of action until that has happened. Thus, claimants, who had held the property at issue for four years and eight months, did not have a cause of action for adverse possession as of the effective date of the 2006 amendment, changing the period of possession from 5 to 20 years.. Since they had no interest in the strip of property and no cause of action for adverse possession of the real property, the amendment did not affect any of their rights. Schoorl v.

        Evidence that owners of land adjoining that in dispute and their predecessors in interest had built and maintained a fence enclosing both tracts since thirty years prior to the deed from said predecessors to the present owners, that both tracts, when assessed, were assessed to said parties, that all taxes paid during said period had been paid by said parties, and that both tracts had been generally regarded by nearby residents as one tract and known by the name of said predecessors, although disputed in part, was sufficient to sustain a decree quieting title in said owners as against the holders of title by an unbroken chain of conveyances beginning with the grantee of the original patent, which holders of title had never been in possession.

        Where one claims title to property by adverse possession, it is not necessary that the five years’ continuous, exclusive adverse possession and payment of taxes should have been immediately preceding the commencement of the action or at any special or particular time, but it is sufficient if the party claiming such title can establish any continuous five-year period subsequent to the acquisition of the legal title by the adverse party during which he has complied with the statute in maintaining his open, notorious, continuous adverse possession and payment of taxes for such period.

        Where one claims title to property by adverse possession, it is not necessary that the five years’ continuous, exclusive adverse possession and payment of taxes should have been immediately preceding the commencement of the action or at any special or particular time, but it is sufficient if the party claiming such title can establish any continuous five-year period subsequent to the acquisition of the legal title by the adverse party during which he has complied with the statute in maintaining his open, notorious, continuous adverse possession and payment of taxes for such period. Cramer v. Walker, 23 Idaho 495, 130 P. 1002 (1913) (now 20 year requirement).
    Mere intention to occupy land, however openly proclaimed, is not possession; intention must be carried into actual execution. Pleasants v. Henry, 36 Idaho 728, 213 P. 565 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Open and notorious occupation with hostile intent is necessary constituent of adverse possession and neither hostile intent without such occupation, nor such occupation without hostile intent, is sufficient. Pleasants v. Henry, 36 Idaho 728, 213 P. 565 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Party claiming title by adverse possession through enclosure of disputed property by fence does not admit title of the other by offering to buy disputed property. Calkins v. Kousouros, 72 Idaho 150, 237 P.2d 1053 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Enclosure by fence of strip of land for period of 8 years established title by adverse possession, even though owner was away from vicinity for six years, since owner does not have to have notice or knowledge of adverse possession, if possession of claimant is open and notorious under claim of title. Calkins v. Kousouros, 72 Idaho 150, 237 P.2d 1053 (1951) (now 20 year requirement).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of trial court that possession of party claiming title to strip of land by adverse possession was adverse and hostile was not overcome by evidence that claimant had made some inquiry as to ownership of disputed land at office of assessor. Hogan v. Blakney, 73 Idaho 274, 251 P.2d 209 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Adverse possession to real estate can only be sustained by proof of uninterrupted and continuous use for the entire prescriptive period. Hogan v. Blakney, 73 Idaho 274, 251 P.2d 209 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim of adverse possession to strip of land based solely on addition to building constructed by claimant applied only to that portion of the strip of land on which the addition stood and did not apply to balance of the strip of land. Hogan v. Blakney, 73 Idaho 274, 251 P.2d 209 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commencement of action by plaintiff to quiet title filed 30 days prior to end of five year period of adverse possession asserted by defendant interrupted the period of defendant’s adverse possession, and the rights of the defendant as against the plaintiff must be determined as of the filing date. Smith v. Long, 76 Idaho 265, 281 P.2d 483 (1955) (now 20 year requirement).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is no proof showing that actual occupation was accompanied by a claim or an intention inconsistent with the title of the owner, an adverse claim based on such occupation cannot be allowed. Swanson v. State, 83 Idaho 126, 358 P.2d 387 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the provisions of this section, protection by substantial enclosure and payment of the taxes are essential to the successful assertion of title to land by adverse possession; however, these requirements do not apply to an easement which is merely appurtenant to the dominant estate and is not taxable separate and apart from it. Sinnett v. Werelus, 83 Idaho 514, 365 P.2d 952 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that respondents and their predecessors possessed the disputed property by enclosure, exclusive use and payment of taxes constituted adverse possession, although the possession was authorized by oral agreement. Lisher v. Krasselt, 94 Idaho 513, 492 P.2d 52 (1974).
    Where defendants maintained substantial enclosure around the land claimed by them by adverse possession, but were assessed only on their land and the land was not described by metes and bounds, and where they paid all taxes assessed to them over the years, they met the requirement of payment of taxes precedent to adverse possession claim. Standall v. Teater, 96 Idaho 152, 525 P.2d 347 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a suit based on adverse possession under this section, where two property owners owned land on the opposite sides of the Boise River, which gradually changed its course northward, and the southerly land-owners fenced the land up to the northerly channel for 40 to 45 years, and where taxes had been paid on both lots by lot number rather than by acreage, the southerly owners had established their claim, to the land between the two channels, by adverse possession but not by accretion. Nesbitt v. Wolfkiel, 100 Idaho 396, 598 P.2d 1046 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where brothers used acre of land as horse breeding business following father’s death in 1962, paid taxes on it and three witnesses testified that they believed brothers were owners of the property, the manner of occupation did not sufficiently “bring home” to sisters, who claimed ownership through inheritance and quitclaim deeds obtained from other relatives, that brothers were claiming ownership through adverse possession, since knowledge of occupation is not knowledge of adverse possession. Tremayne v. Taylor, 101 Idaho 792, 621 P.2d 408 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In general, a party asserting adverse possession under an oral claim of title must prove by clear and satisfactory evidence that he or she has been in possession of the property for at least five years, and that the possession has been actual, open, visible, notorious, continuous, and hostile to the party against whom the claim of adverse possession is made. Shelton v. Boydstun Beach Ass’n, 102 Idaho 818, 641 P.2d 1005 (Ct. App. 1982) (now 20 year requirement).
       </p>
       <p>
        When applied to extinguishment of an easement, the elements of exclusivity and hostility require that the land owner use the property within the easement in a manner wholly inconsistent with enjoyment of the easement. Shelton v. Boydstun Beach Ass’n, 102 Idaho 818, 641 P.2d 1005 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a deputy county assessor testified that taxes on a disputed strip were not assessed to the party seeking adverse possession, rather, the taxes were assessed to the owners of the adjacent property and their predecessors-in-interest, there was no evidence in the record from which the trial court could have found that the party seeking adverse possession actually paid taxes assessed against the disputed property and adverse possession is not available to the party seeking adverse possession.

        Where one enters into the possession of a tract of land and maintains a fence, and occupies and uses the land up to the fence for a period of 40 years, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the successive owner of the adjoining land, such occupancy will amount to adverse possession, even though the division fence was erected through mistake as to the true boundary line.

       <p>
        Acquiescence in the maintenance of a line fence for a great length of time may be presumptive evidence of an agreement as to a boundary line, but is not conclusive evidence and will not overcome a positive agreement or understanding that after the true line is established the fence will be made to conform to it.

       <p>
        Where a fence constitutes a monument between tracts of conterminous owners and such monument establishes the boundary line between the adjoining premises, the requirement of this section as to payment of taxes is satisfied by such payment on the lot within which the disputed tract is enclosed.

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that the property being adversely claimed be usually cultivated or improved was satisfied by adverse claimant’s improving the property by planting hedgerows, flower gardens, shrubs and trees along the purported boundary line. Hyde v. Lawson, 94 Idaho 886, 499 P.2d 1242 (1972), overruled on other grounds, Nesbitt v. Wolfkiel, 100 Idaho 396, 598 P.2d 1046 (1979).

        Where the owner of a lot conveyed to plaintiff’s grantor the westerly 100 feet of the lot and subsequently conveyed all of said lot “except the westerly 100 ft. thereof” to defendant and the parties paid taxes on their respective tracts according to such descriptions, adverse possession of land between the boundary between the two tracts and a fence some distance to the west of the true boundary was not established in defendant.

        Inasmuch as adverse possession must be established by clear and satisfactory evidence, plaintiffs who sought to quiet title to property on basis of adverse possession had not established the requisite hostile possession in light of defendants’ evidence of an oral lease agreement.

        When one occupies the land of a blood relative, such occupation is presumptively with the permission of the true owner. Berg v. Fairman, 107 Idaho 441, 690 P.2d 896 (1984).

        Lot Number Exception.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where claimant’s predecessors in title to disputed land were blood relatives, she was faced with a presumption of law that the occupation of the disputed strip was permissive and, therefore, it was incumbent upon her to, by affidavit or otherwise, oppose the motion for summary judgment setting forth specific facts that would controvert the presumption of permissive occupation; where the record was devoid of any specific facts controverting the presumption, summary judgment in action to quiet title was proper. Berg v. Fairman, 107 Idaho 441, 690 P.2d 896 (1984). Lot Number Exception.
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment quieting title in favor of the claimant was affirmed because the lot number exception to this section applied to the claimant’s cause where his property was described by a lot number for tax purposes, and the claimant provided evidence he paid taxes on his lot from 1996 to 2001; the neighbor did not demonstrate that the county assessor assessed taxes on the neighbor’s farm according to a metes and bounds description, but, instead, the assessor used a government survey description from which the precise quantity of land being assessed could not be determined.

        Where an easement has been created, but no occasion has arisen for its use, the owner of the servient tenement may plant trees, erect a fence, etc., and such use will not be deemed to be adverse, until the need to use the easement arises.

        Where common driveway thirteen to twenty-one feet in width was maintained within a thirty-foot easement originally granted, improvements constructed by landowners which interfered with the thirty-foot easement were not adverse and party’s right to full width of the easement had not been extinguished because a need to actually utilize the unused portion of the easement had not yet arisen; judgment in favor of party’s right to full width of easement was upheld.

        Payment of taxes must be shown in order to establish title by adverse possession. Brose v. Boise City Ry. & Term. Co., 5 Idaho 694, 51 P. 753 (1897); Blayden v. Morris, 37 Idaho 37, 214 P. 1039 (1923), overruled on other grounds, Scott v. Gubler, 95 Idaho 441, 511 P.2d 262 (1973).

        Adverse possession cannot be established unless it is shown that the land has been occupied and claimed for five years continuously, and the claimant or his predecessors have paid all taxes levied upon such land or that the property was exempt from taxation or has never been assessed. Swank v. Sweetwater Irrigation & Power Co., 15 Idaho 353, 98 P. 297 (1908); Dickerson v. Hansen, 32 Idaho 18, 177 P. 760 (1918) (now 20 year requirement).

       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant holding land by adverse possession need only pay taxes levied and assessed, and where no taxes were levied or assessed on land during a period of eight years in which the claimant held the land under color of title, he could not be divested of his title by adverse possession by a claim that he had not met the requirements of the statutes on adverse possession of paying taxes levied and assessed on the land. Stickel v. Carter, 63 Idaho 78, 117 P.2d 477 (1941) (now 20 year requirement).
    Evidence by assessor that he assessed land enclosed by fence in name of claimant established payment of taxes on disputed land, even though assessor did not know for sure that land within fence was owned by claimant. Calkins v. Kousouros, 72 Idaho 150, 237 P.2d 1053 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of trial court that claimant of strip of land by adverse possession had paid all taxes levied and assessed against land was technically incorrect where evidence showed that no taxes were ever levied against the land, but finding was sufficient to cover favorable finding on matter of taxes in favor of claimant. Hogan v. Blakney, 73 Idaho 274, 251 P.2d 209 (1952).

        If there is an established boundary line between tracts occupied by parties, the payment of taxes by the parties is a payment as to the land actually in possession of the respective parties. Edgeller v. Johnston, 74 Idaho 359, 262 P.2d 1006 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of taxes by parties to quiet title proceeding on their properties as described by the tax rolls constituted payment of taxes on their properties up to the established boundary line between their properties. Beneficial Life Ins. Co. v. Wakamatsu, 75 Idaho 232, 270 P.2d 830 (1954).
       </p>

        The fact that appellants did not nor did their predecessors pay taxes and assessments levied against properties involved would defeat their cause of action seeking to establish fence as boundary of their and adjoining landowners’ property.

        The defendants did not establish adverse possession in a suit to quiet title when they offered no evidence that they had paid the taxes on the property in dispute during the period of limitations. Dickerson v. Brewster, 88 Idaho 330, 399 P.2d 407 (1965).

        A village cannot claim title by adverse possession to land on which it has levied and collected taxes from the record owner during the period of asserted possession. Hamilton v. McCall, 90 Idaho 253, 409 P.2d 393 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since, according to the tax collection procedures followed in this state, the counties act as a collecting agency in the collection of taxes for the state and municipality, payment of property taxes to the county rather than the state itself was sufficient to establish payment of taxes as required to sustain a claim pursuant to this section. Rutledge v. State, 94 Idaho 121, 482 P.2d 515 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of the payment of taxes is met where the person adversely occupying land which is situated between property owned by him and the property owned by his opponent has paid the required taxes on the property owned by him, because payment of taxes assessed on property deeded to adverse claimant is deemed payment of taxes on the lands in his possession. Hyde v. Lawson, 94 Idaho 886, 499 P.2d 1242 (1972), overruled on other grounds, Nesbitt v. Wolfkiel, 100 Idaho 396, 598 P.2d 1046 (1979).

    Where taxes were assessed by lot number rather than by metes and bounds description payment of taxes on the lot within which disputed property is enclosed satisfied the tax payment requirement of this section. Scott v. Gubler, 95 Idaho 441, 511 P.2d 258 (1973).

        In a quiet title action, where plaintiff had erected a fence which encroached about 60 feet onto adjacent lot and where plaintiff improved the overlapping strip by planting a lawn and trees and installing a septic tank, plaintiff’s payment of all taxes assessed upon the amount of land he claimed for a period longer than five years satisfied the requirements of this section for title by adverse possession, even though the tax assessment sheets did not particularly describe the land being taxed.

        When both the record owner and the adverse possessor have paid taxes on the same parcel of land during the period of adverse possession, the adverse possessor prevails; accordingly, where a county tax plat erroneously showed the northern edge of a street, rather than its center line, as the southern border of the plaintiff adverse possessors’ property thereby shifting plaintiffs’ property, for assessment purposes, 25 feet to the north of its actual location as described by metes and bounds with the result that both the plaintiffs and the record owner of the property to the north were paying taxes on the 25-foot strip of land, the plaintiffs were entitled to the 25-foot parcel.

       <p>
        Statute of limitations is affirmative defense which imposes burden upon one asserting it of proving every element necessary to establish it. Johnston v. Keefer, 48 Idaho 42, 280 P. 324 (1929).

       <p>
        Where a contract contains an acceleration clause, positive in its terms and without optional features, a default under said clause renders the entire indebtedness due and the statute runs from such default. Canadian Birkbeck Inv. & Sav. Co. v. Williamson, 32 Idaho 624, 186 P. 916 (1920); Perkins v. Swain, 35 Idaho 485, 207 P. 585 (1922).

        In action to recover purchase price of stock, cause of action ordinarily accrues only upon demand. Johnston v. Keefer, 48 Idaho 42, 280 P. 324 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no time is fixed for demand, it will be presumed to have been made in reasonable time or at expiration of period within which statute would have run from its date, and statute is then set in motion. Johnston v. Keefer, 48 Idaho 42, 280 P. 324 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no time is specified for doing of act, other than payment of money, it is rule of law that demand for performance is necessary in order to put promisor in default. Johnston v. Keefer, 48 Idaho 42, 280 P. 324 (1929).
    In malpractice action, summary judgment based upon statute of limitations was upheld because plaintiff failed to establish a triable issue of material fact respecting fraudulent concealment of bullet in the body, where plaintiff’s sole affidavit contained no reference to the time when the bullet was discovered but a general statement that it was discovered within two years, no time as to feeling of pain was specific, surgeon who found bullet was not identified and no discussion of particulars as to alleged misleading by surgeon was given.

        Although Idaho’s statute of limitations for foreclosure of a deed of trust had lapsed, this did not allow the Chapter 7 Trustee to avoid the lien under 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a). Under Idaho law, in order for a bona fide purchaser to prevail against the beneficiary under a deed of trust, that purchaser must first record its instrument of conveyance; the trustee was not such a purchaser.

        Where the promissory note expressly stated that the maturity date was March 1, 2047, and there was no provision in the note providing that the maturity date would change if the amounts owing under the note were declared to be immediately due and payable because of a default, the five-year statute of limitations for foreclosure would not begin to run until March 1, 2047, not on the 2008 date of default. Kempton-Baughman v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 162 Idaho 174, 395 P.3d 393 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acceleration of the debt, caused by a default in payment by the lendee, does not change the maturity date of the loan, and trigger the start of the statute of limitations period, unless there is a provision in the promissory note which alters the stated maturity date in the event of acceleration.

        Where the beneficiaries received, on November 8, 2012, a partial payment on a trust deed note with an original maturity date of June 28, 2006, and applied that payment to the debt, that partial payment restarted the five-year statute of limitation on any action on the note.

        Where in an action for damages resulting from the seller’s representations that the property extended beyond the highway and the purchaser could build over the road, the purchaser knew of the existence of the highway prior to the execution of the contract for the sale of the property in 1974, and the breach of contract action was not brought until 1982, the statute of limitations precluded the purchaser from asserting a breach of contract.

        Student’s breach of contract claims were time-barred where there was no evidence of an express or formal contract with the university. The handbooks and other documents the student referenced did not constitute an express contract, and, thus, the breach of contract claim was based on an implied contract and the four-year limitations period of this section applied.

        Where the plaintiff who has loaned decedent large sums of money under circumstances, and at times, when it was greatly needed in the preservation of the decedent’s estate, to support himself, and for the payment of numerous large counsel fees, and, upon decedent’s death, the plaintiff brought an action for the amount of the loans and sought the enforcement of a lien on the interest of the decedent in an estate, a federal district court sitting as a court of equity would not adjudge that recovery was barred by the five-year statute of limitations even if it could properly do so.

    Section 41-2401 requires that fire insurers issue policies only on the New York standard form as revised in 1943; the form includes a clause specifying a 12-month limitation period for claims.

        Absent an acceleration clause in the parties’ agreement, where money is payable in installments, the statute of limitations begins to run against a cause of action for the recovery of a delinquent installment as of the time it becomes due. Where a loan contract contains a clause accelerating the full balance due upon the debtor’s default, the Idaho statute of limitations commences to run from the date of that default, unless the acceleration clause is elective, in which case, the statute of limitations does not run as to the entire indebtedness unless the lender makes an affirmative election.

        A written approval by the debtor of the report of the lender showing advances and loans made and reciting that none of the advances or loans have been repaid constituted an “acknowledgment” that the loans had not been repaid and of the continuing indebtedness, so that the statute of limitations began to run anew on the date of such acknowledgment.

        Repair Doctrine.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The “repair doctrine” bars a contractor or vendor of faulty goods, who has discouraged the owner or purchaser from filing suit until the applicable statutes of limitation have run, from utilizing the statutes of limitations as a defense; such doctrine has not been subscribed to either as a version of equitable estoppel or an alternative means of barring or tolling a statute of limitations defense by the courts of Idaho. J.R. Simplot Co. v. Chemetics Int’l, Inc., 126 Idaho 532, 887 P.2d 1039 (1994).

        The statute of limitation applicable to a bank’s action against a school district for moneys advanced in payment of school warrants, issued against taxes on lands within the district, was suspended by a moratorium act extending time for payment of delinquent taxes and redemption of lands from tax liens. American Nat’l Bank v. Joint Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 9, 61 Idaho 405, 102 P.2d 826 (1940).

        A credit union’s exercise of its “self-help” right of set-off contained in the pledge agreement with the plaintiff and her husband did not require any court action to accomplish, and, accordingly, the statute of limitations was not implicated when the credit union set off funds deposited with it against defaulted loans of the husband.

        Because the five-year statute of limitations did not begin to run against buyers of farmland while the buyers were in uninterrupted possession, the buyers were not barred from asserting a claim for specific performance as to land they possessed in accordance with the terms of a land exchange agreement they had made with the sellers more than five years earlier.

        Refusal to allow amendment of complaint to foreclose contractor’s lien by adding a cause of action for quantum meruit, where more than four and one-half years had elapsed since the performance of the alleged extra work and the extra work was independent of the original contracts, was proper inasmuch as the four year statute of limitations was applicable to the cause of action for quantum meruit.

    Where water heater was installed in home pursuant to contract and, 18 years later, heater exploded, an action by homeowner alleging misfeasance in installation of water heater was a claim in tort, not contract, and statutes of limitations relating to contracts did not apply.

        The running of the statute of limitations does not extinguish a debt. Statutes of limitations are limitations on a party’s right to bring an action.

        In suit for specific performance of oral contract for purchase of mother’s farm by the plaintiff upon which plaintiff had made substantial improvements, the trial court was not required to make a finding relative to statute of limitations pleaded as a defense to the oral contract since plaintiff’s right for recovery for improvements did not accrue until after mother repudiated the oral contract of purchase.

        Legal malpractice cause of action brought by decedent’s sons in 1974 in regard to probate of father’s estate in 1954 accrued in 1954 at the time of the alleged negligence, rather than in 1972, when the alleged negligence was discovered; thus, whether the limitation in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-224" target="_blank">§ 5-224 </a></cite>or this section was applicable, the action was barred, having been brought more than four years after its occurrence.

        The cause of action for an accountant’s malpractice for each fiscal year first accrued at the time of the actual occurrence of the illegal acts of malpractice, rather than the date when the auditors first discovered the defalcations. Owyhee County v. Rife, 100 Idaho 91, 593 P.2d 995 (1979).

        Since the alleged promise of seller that certain property adjoining that of purchasers would be reserved for common use was not a lien or encumbrance, order of bankruptcy court authorizing sale of part of such property “free and clear of all liens and encumbrances” did not put the purchasers on notice of fraud and did not start the statute of limitations running on purchasers’ action to enforce the promise.

        Where the parties to an alleged oral agreement concerning the restoration and repair of a vintage automobile failed to reach any agreement as to the particular work to be performed, the time frame within which the restoration would be completed, or the dates when any payments would be due, the entire course of dealings between the parties involving the restoration of the vehicle constituted a single transaction, and a cause of action on the alleged agreement did not accrue until all of the work was completed and the automobile was ready to be picked up. Anderson v. Schwegel, 118 Idaho 362, 796 P.2d 1035 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of limitations does not begin to run until a claim accrues upon the breach of contract and, as sufficient and competent evidence to support a finding of breach was not available until 1988 when evidence of discovery of logging and the listing of the property for sale became apparent, there was substantial evidence to present the issue to the jury. Spence v. Howell, 126 Idaho 763, 890 P.2d 714 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiffs’ claim for specific performance of an agreement to convey real property was not barred by the statute of limitations where the statute did not begin to run until mortgages or loans encumbrancing the property at issue were extinguished, thereby fulfilling a condition in the agreement and requiring the defendant to convey the property. Simons v. Simons, 134 Idaho 824, 11 P.3d 20 (2000).
    Trial court did not err in holding that a property owner’s breach of contract claim against a well-drilling company was barred by the statute because the four-year limitations period began to run in August 2006 when construction of a well on the owner’s property was completed; hence, the owner’s April 6, 2011 action was untimely.

        Where a promise to repay money fails to include a date for repayment, courts imply a promise to repay the loan after a “reasonable time”, and the statute of limitations begins to run at a reasonable time after the loan was made. When parties to a contract have not agreed to a term essential to determine their rights and duties, the court supplies a term reasonable in the circumstances. Where no time is expressed in a contract for its performance, the law implies that it shall be performed within a reasonable time as determined by the subject matter of the contract, the situation of the parties, and the circumstances attending the performance.

        Where a former client’s disability checks were alleged to have been cashed and spent by the law firm which received the checks, the cause of action was not subject to the statute of limitations for legal malpractice under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-219" target="_blank">§ 5-219</a></cite>(4) or the statute of limitations for fraud under subsection (4) of this section.

Caldwell, 152 Idaho 15, 266 P.3d 490 (Ct. App. 2011).
    Section 30-21-810 provides a cause of action for parties who suffer damages as a result of a party’s failure to file a certificate of assumed business name. In a case where a plaintiff has been misled to his or her prejudice resulting in a failure to timely name a proper defendant before the expiration of the statute of limitations, the plaintiff’s damages will include the lost opportunity for recovery in the original action. In order to recover in such a case in which personal injury is alleged, the plaintiff must show that he or she would have prevailed in his or her personal injury action and the amount of damages he or she would have recovered, in addition to any other damages that may have been proximately caused by the defendant’s breach of its statutory duty. As this is a statutory remedy, a party must bring this action within 3 years of the accrual of the cause of action, pursuant to this section. Gallagher v.

        Where county treasurer and tax collector served successive two-year terms of office, an action brought by county to recover under performance bonds due to an official’s misappropriation of funds and failure to collect delinquent taxes was barred by the three-year statute of limitations under subdivision 1. of this section where discovery of the misdeeds occurred more than three years after the particular term of office ended, since the action accrued at the end of each individual term of office.

        All of the possible dates upon which the running of the statute of limitation could have commenced were more than three years prior to the date when the action was filed; therefore, the action was brought beyond the three-year limitation and should not have been decided on the merits by the magistrate.

        Where the company had sufficient facts to know, or with the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of the corporation’s alleged fraudulent concealment and fraudulent misrepresentation no later than July 1990, the company’s fraudulent concealment and fraudulent misrepresentation claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations under this section.

        Fraud statute of limitations governed constructive fraud claims because the elements of a constructive fraud claim were essentially the same as the elements of fraud claims; the statute of limitations applies to constructive fraud claims even though those claims may also involve a breach of fiduciary duty, and it is left for the trial court to determine whether a plaintiff’s cause of action is, in substance, a true constructive fraud claim, a breach of fiduciary duty claim, or something else.

        While a constructive fraud claim may include a breach of fiduciary duty, it does not necessarily follow that a breach of fiduciary duty always results in constructive fraud, nor is a breach of fiduciary duty required to establish constructive fraud; thus, a constructive fraud claim is not removed from the fraud statute of limitations merely because it involves a breach of fiduciary duty.

        An action for fraud or a deceit against a professional is covered by the statute of limitations for fraud, subdivision 4. of this section, rather than the statute of limitations for professional malpractice, subdivision 4. of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-219" target="_blank">§ 5-219</a></cite>.

        The plaintiff’s allegations based on fraud were not covered by the professional malpractice statute, but rather by the fraud statute of limitations contained in subsection (4) of this section. McCoy v. Lyons, 120 Idaho 765, 820 P.2d 360 (1991).

        The cause of action for an accountant’s malpractice for each fiscal year first accrued at the time of the actual occurrence of the illegal acts of malpractice, rather than the date when the auditors first discovered the defalcations. Owyhee County v. Rife, 100 Idaho 91, 593 P.2d 995 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, a cause of action accrues at the time of the wrongdoing, rather than at the time of discovery of the wrongful act. Wing v. Martin, 107 Idaho 267, 688 P.2d 1172 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since, under the cause of action for wrongful birth, there is no defective child until and unless the birth occurs, the statute of limitations cannot begin to run until the date of birth. Blake v. Cruz, 108 Idaho 253, 698 P.2d 315 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no broad discovery exception under this section; instead, the limitation period begins to run from the date damage has occurred. Zumwalt v. Stephan, Balleisen & Slavin, 113 Idaho 822, 748 P.2d 406 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        A cause of action against a notary public for falsely acknowledging forged signatures on a promissory note and mortgage did not accrue until sellers of land first learned that they had been damaged by forgery, not when the signatures had been forged and notarized. Osborn v. Ahrens, 116 Idaho 14, 773 P.2d 282 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the language in subdivision 4 of this section that a cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued as of the time of the occurrence, act or omission complained of, a cause of action does not accrue at the time of the act complained of unless some damage has occurred. Hawley v. Green, 117 Idaho 498, 788 P.2d 1321 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Debtor’s suit for libel, against bank issuing credit card, based on the erroneous reporting of credit information was barred by the statute of limitations because the cause of action accrued at the time the bank first furnished the information to the credit reporting agency, not at the time of the discovery of the wrongful act four years later. Hoglan v. First Sec. Bank, 120 Idaho 682, 819 P.2d 100 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a patient eventually lost her sight after cataract surgery in October 1999, the only issue of negligence presented concerned the doctor’s post-operative care. The patient’s claim could not have accrued before the first incident of alleged malpractice, which was on November 12, 1999; the patient filed her request for a prelitigation screening panel on November 8, 2001, less than two years after the alleged act of malpractice, so her claim was not barred by the statute of limitations. Conway v. Sonntag, 141 Idaho 144, 106 P.3d 470 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in dismissing plaintiff’s federal civil rights action against the state for false imprisonment. It failed to afford plaintiff credit for the time that plaintiff served before a sentence was imposed, and the two-year statute of limitations did not begin to run until the false imprisonment ended; hence, plaintiff’s claim was timely. McCabe v. Craven, 145 Idaho 954, 188 P.3d 896 (2008).

        Chapter 7 trustee’s adversary proceeding alleging that a notary public and the notary’s employer were liable under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.51.html#t51c01s51-118" target="_blank">§ 51-118 </a></cite>for damages the notary caused when she notarized the forged signature of a debtor on a deed of trust was not time-barred, even though the trustee filed his adversary proceeding on March 25, 2009, more than three years after the notary notarized the debtor’s signature. Subsection (4) of this section gave the debtor two years from the date he discovered the notary’s misconduct to file a lawsuit. The debtor discovered the notary’s conduct in May 2006, and declared bankruptcy on March 28, 2008. 11 U.S.C.S. § 108 extended the period the trustee had to file his adversary proceeding until March 28, 2010. Gugino v. Alliance Title &amp; Escrow Corp. (In re Ganier), 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 1444 (Bankr. D. Idaho May 3, 2010).

        The cause of action for an accountant’s malpractice for each fiscal year first accrued at the time of the actual occurrence of the illegal acts of malpractice, rather than the date when the auditors first discovered the defalcations. Owyhee County v. Rife, 100 Idaho 91, 593 P.2d 995 (1979).

        Trial court erred in dismissing plaintiff’s federal civil rights action against the state for false imprisonment. It failed to afford plaintiff credit for the time that plaintiff served before a sentence was imposed, and the two-year statute of limitations did not begin to run until the false imprisonment ended; hence, plaintiff’s claim was timely.

Subsection (4) of this section gave the debtor two years from the date he discovered the notary’s misconduct to file a lawsuit. The debtor discovered the notary’s conduct in May 2006, and declared bankruptcy on March 28, 2008. 11 U.S.C.S. § 108 extended the period the trustee had to file his adversary proceeding until March 28, 2010.

    Products liability cause of action against a manufacturer of a hip device was not property of the estate where, even though it was implanted pre-petition and debtor began experiencing pain pre-petition, his injury had not accrued under Idaho law, as it was not objectively ascertainable. Nor was the cause of action sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past, because on the day of the bankruptcy filing, it remained only a nebulous possibility that the device would cause him injury.

    The latent circumstance of increased probability of embolization, resulting in possible future adverse medical consequences was far too attenuated an “occurrence” to give rise to a viable cause of action such as would activate a statute of limitations; plaintiff’s cause of action arose either at the time of his stroke in which case the action was timely filed or on date that plaintiff visited defendant complaining of chest pains, if the occurrences of that day were shown to have been damage caused by embolization from heart valve due to defendants’ alleged inadequate treatment, in which case action was untimely filed.

        A third-party action by a real estate loan broker against an attorney who helped close a loan was held to be an action for malpractice rather than one for indemnification or contribution where the complaint alleged a breach of fiduciary duty and negligence on the part of the attorney for failing to clear title to the property involved and failing to advise as to the property’s true value; hence, the two-year statute of limitations in this section applied.

        The existence or effect of any alleged negligence regarding the attorneys’ strategy and legal advice as to the statute of limitations depended upon the outcome of the litigation against the city by the insurer and contractor; there could not be objective proof of actual damage until the litigation was concluded, and the fact that the city was sued did not, by itself, constitute a breach of duty by the attorneys.

        District court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of an attorney and in dismissing his client’s legal malpractice action arising from the attorney’s representation of the client in a criminal case in which the client was later exonerated, because the client’s malpractice cause of action did not begin to accrue until he was exonerated on July 10, 2014. The district court erred in holding that the client’s malpractice cause of action, which was filed on February 17, 2015, was barred by the two year statute of limitations. Molen v. Christian, 161 Idaho 577, 388 P.3d 591 (2017).
    Subsection (4) barred a medical malpractice action, where a patient’s cancer was objectively ascertainable and capable of being diagnosed when it first became symptomatic for the patient, but the patient’s oncologist conceded uncertainty and the patient waited two years after a biopsy to pursue a legal claim.

        Trial court correctly treated all of a former client’s claims against an attorney as subject to the two-year statute of limitations for professional malpractice, rather than the five-year statute of limitations for a contract dispute, because all of the client’s claims arose out of the attorney’s alleged failure to perform services in connection with the representation of the client. There were no contractual provisions which guaranteed the outcome of the representation or specified an elevated standard of care which were breached. Greenfield v. Smith, 162 Idaho 246, 395 P.3d 1279 (2017).

        When professional malpractice involves fraudulent or intentional concealment of the wrongdoing, even when the initial wrongdoing is merely negligent, the statute of limitation contained in subdivision 4 of this section is tolled until the injured party “knows or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been put on inquiry regarding the matter complained of”; after that date, the statute of limitation period is one year, after which an action for professional malpractice is barred.

        Grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant attorney on a malpractice claim on the grounds that the applicable statute of limitations of subdivision 4 of this section had expired was proper because plaintiff was actually damaged when it accrued legal fees due to its need to hire new counsel to oversee damage control in a matter involving work done by the former attorney and that event, which occurred more than two years prior to the commencement of the malpractice action, started the running of the statute of limitations.

Rice v. Litster, 132 Idaho 897, 980 P.2d 561 (1999).
    Subsection (4) barred a medical malpractice action, where a patient’s cancer was objectively ascertainable and capable of being diagnosed when it first became symptomatic for the patient, but the patient’s oncologist conceded uncertainty and the patient waited two years after a biopsy to pursue a legal claim.

        Trial court correctly treated all of a former client’s claims against an attorney as subject to the two-year statute of limitations for professional malpractice, rather than the five-year statute of limitations for a contract dispute, because all of the client’s claims arose out of the attorney’s alleged failure to perform services in connection with the representation of the client. There were no contractual provisions which guaranteed the outcome of the representation or specified an elevated standard of care which were breached. Greenfield v.

        Normally, an intrauterine device (I.U.D.) in situ will not be considered a foreign object under this section; devices deliberately placed in the body, with the patient’s knowledge and consent, which are within the body intentionally are not “foreign objects.” Ogle v.

        Where an intrauterine device (I.U.D.) was negligently left in the body, after the surgeon represented to the patient that it has been removed, the I.U.D. was no longer deliberately or intentionally within the body; it was inadvertently or unintentionally left in the body; thus the I.U.D. then becomes a foreign object within the meaning of this section.

        Legal malpractice action was barred by a two-year statute of limitations because “some damage” occurred when property was transferred to a trust to gain a tax advantage since two clients could have reformed the trust at that time to correct any defects; therefore, a district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of several lawyers. Anderson v. Glenn, 139 Idaho 799, 87 P.3d 286 (2003).

        Because any injuries resulting from a surgery performed in the wrong location were objectively ascertainable at that time and would have been discovered if a more thorough examination had been performed, a medical malpractice suit was time-barred, although the patient’s symptoms subsided after the surgery and he had no knowledge of any negligence.

        Because actions under 42 U.S.C. 1983 are analogous to actions for injuries to personal rights, they are subject to the state statute of limitations for personal injury actions. The pertinent Idaho statute is subdivision 4 of this section, which provides a two-year statute of limitations for actions based on personal injury. Samuel v. Michaud, 980 F. Supp. 1381 (D.

        The “occurrence, act or omission” which this section defines as the accrual of a cause of action for wrongful death refers to the death of the person, caused by the wrongful acts of another, and the running of the statute of limitation on the wrongful death cause of action begins from the date of death.

        The statute of limitations on the decedent’s own cause of action is irrelevant when ascertaining the timeliness of his heirs’ wrongful death action.

        The statute of limitations on the decedent’s own cause of action is irrelevant when ascertaining the timeliness of his heirs’ wrongful death action. As the actionable wrong for a wrongful death action is not complete until the death of the decedent, the statute of limitations does not begin running until that time. Castorena v. GE, 149 Idaho 609, 238 P.3d 209 (2010).

        An action on a Canadian judgment, which was not specifically provided for by any other section of the statute of limitations provisions, fell within the purview of this section; in order to successfully assert the statute of limitations as a bar to this action defendant must show he had resided in Idaho for more than four years.

        Four-year statute of limitations applied to the buyers’ cause of action against the real estate company and realtor where, although the duties owed to the buyers were clearly statutory, the buyers had to deal with the breaches in tort, not contract. Sumpter v. Holland Realty, Inc., 140 Idaho 349, 93 P.3d 680 (2004).

       <p>
        The general rule is that length of time is no bar to a trust, clearly established, and that express trusts are not within the statute of limitations; but that rule is subject to the qualification that time begins to run against a trust as soon as it is openly disavowed by the trustee, which disavowal or repudiation is clearly and unequivocally made known to the cestui que trust.

        When two statutes are capable of coexistence, it is the duty of the courts to harmonize and reconcile them so as to deprive neither of potency and force; thus,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-236" target="_blank">§ 5-236 </a></cite>which declares that the statute of limitations remains tolled where a person is both a minor and incompetent has to be read in conjunction with this section which specifically limits the tolling period for both minority and incompetency to six years. Brackney v. Combustion Eng’g, Inc., 674 F.2d 812 (9th Cir. 1982).
    The 1976 amendment to this section enacted on March 31, 1976, which provided that subsequent to September 1, 1976, no action would be tolled for a period of more than six years, was expressly made retroactive by the Idaho legislature so as to destroy any stale cause of action which had been lying idle for more than six years; thus, a minor’s cause of action filed in 1979 for a wrongful death which occurred in 1961 was properly dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations, since the minor had sat on his remedy for more than 15 years under the old minority tolling provision and since he had failed to file suit during the five month period after the law was changed and before the new law became effective. Brackney v. Combustion Eng’g, Inc., 674 F.2d 812 (9th Cir. 1982).

        Where the plaintiff was arrested in July, 1974 on a criminal complaint of embezzlement and imprisoned for one day before being released on his own recognizance, and following his conviction was again imprisoned, his cause of action under the federal civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983, arose at the time of his first imprisonment and the three-year statute of limitations under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-218" target="_blank">§ 5-218 </a></cite>was not tolled under this section by his subsequent imprisonment; accordingly, the filing of his civil rights action in August, 1977 was not timely and the action was barred. Gowin v. Altmiller, 663 F.2d 820 (9th Cir. 1981). But see Idaho State Bar v. Tway, 128 Idaho 794, 919 P.2d 323 (1996).

        Under Idaho law, a married woman is empowered, without joining her husband, to bring an action for damages for her own personal injury; hence the provision governing the disability of a married woman did not toll the running of the statute as to a married woman’s action for medical malpractice until the termination of her marriage.

        When two statutes are capable of coexistence, it is the duty of the courts to harmonize and reconcile them so as to deprive neither of potency and force; thus, this section which declares that the statute of limitations remains tolled where a person is both a minor and incompetent has to be read in conjunction with<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-230" target="_blank">§ 5-230 </a></cite>which specifically limits the tolling period for both minority and incompetency to six years.

        Clear and definite acknowledgment of the existence of a contract and liability which has not at the time been barred by the statute of limitations, whether coupled with a direct promise to pay or not, carries with it an implied promise to pay the debt and fixes a new date from which the statute begins to run.

        Clear and definite acknowledgment of the existence of a contract and liability which has not at the time been barred by the statute of limitations, whether coupled with a direct promise to pay or not, carries with it an implied promise to pay the debt and fixes a new date from which the statute begins to run.

        Method of determining whether agreement after limitations had run was acknowledgment of a continued Carey Act water contract, or whether new obligation was created, is to inquire whether, in action to enforce obligation, new contract or old one as extended would be pleaded as foundation of plaintiff’s claim.

        The limitation period can be extended by an obligor who makes a partial payment after the note is due, as such partial payment is deemed equivalent to a new promise by the obligor to satisfy the debt. Thomson v. Sunny Ridge Village Partnership, 118 Idaho 330, 796 P.2d 539 (Ct. App. 1990).
    Because this section treats a payment of interest as the equivalent of a new promise, and because a promise binds only the person making it, so too a partial payment should extend a statutory period of limitation only as to the person who makes the payment, although, certain exceptions include when a nonpaying co-debtor directs or requests that the payment be made, authorizes or consents to the payment, or ratifies such payment. Thomson v. Sunny Ridge Village Partnership, 118 Idaho 330, 796 P.2d 539 (Ct. App. 1990).

        Payments made by a third party to a creditor on behalf of, and at the express request of, the debtor tolls the statute of limitations and creates a new promise to pay the residue of the debt. Joseph v. Darrar, 93 Idaho 762, 472 P.2d 328 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Collection of the merchandise account balance was not time-barred under this section because of payments on the account; a payment on account removes the debt from the operation of the statute of limitations pursuant to this section. Modern Mills, Inc. v. Havens, 112 Idaho 1101, 739 P.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence adequately supported the court’s conclusion that the promise to pay had been renewed by an interest payment, where the trial judge was persuaded that alterations on the face of the exhibits were made in response to the promisor’s directions; therefore, the action on the note was not barred by the five-year limitation period prescribed by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c02s5-216" target="_blank">§ 5-216</a></cite>.

        Settlement between farmer and manufacturer of herbicide did not toll the limitation period on the farmer’s product liability claim. The debt acknowledged and paid was for a particular year and for a particular acreage, and not a debt for any and all future uses; therefore, the settlement did not amount to payment of “principle or interest . . . equivalent to a new promise . . . to pay the residue of the debt.” Brower v.

       <p>
        The authorities are divided as to whether the suit should be upon the original demand or obligation or the new promise; however, Idaho is committed to the doctrine that the running of the statute of limitations does not extinguish the debt and that the action should be upon the original obligation, and that the bar of the statute of limitations merely operates on the remedy and does not extinguish the debt.

        Payment on a promissory note to remove the bar of the statute of limitations must be evidenced by a writing, must be a voluntary payment by the payee, and must be made for the purpose of applying the payment on the note.

        A written approval by the debtor of a report of the lender showing advances and loans made up to that time and showing that none of the advances or loans had been repaid constituted an acknowledgment that the loans had not been repaid and that the debt continued to exist so that the statute of limitations began to run anew on the date of such acknowledgment. Cummings v. Langroise, 36 F. Supp. 174 (D. Idaho 1940), aff’d 123 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 664, 62 S. Ct. 944, 86 L. Ed. 1741 (1942).

    , 103 Idaho 19, 644 P.2d 341 (1982) that this section engrafted a limited discovery exception in the area of tort liability arising out of the design or construction of improvements to real property, and that such exemption would only be applicable to latent defects since patent defects by definition would be those which should have been discovered, was not intended to be a broad statement expressing the general application of this section but rather, was an expression of how this section functions in the narrow setting of an action alleging defective design; where plaintiff had not sought to prove that defendant architect’s design was defective, but alleged that he was negligent in his inspection of the apartment, such statement of law did not apply.

        This section is not violative of the equal protection clause of the federal constitution because protecting against the litigation of stale claims is a legitimate state interest justifying a special classification for architects and builders.

       <p>
        Where there are valid differences supporting the legislative classification as between architects and builders on the one hand and owners, occupiers and material suppliers on the other, the various classes are not similarly situated and, therefore, this section does not violate Idaho Const., Art. III, § 19. Twin Falls Clinic & Hosp. Bldg. Corp. v. Hamill, 103 Idaho 19, 644 P.2d 341 (1982).

        The elements of equitable estoppel, the only non-statutory bar to a statute of limitations defense in Idaho, are: (1) a false representation or concealment of a material fact with actual or constructive knowledge of the truth; (2) that the party asserting estoppel did not know or could not discover the truth; (3) that the false representation or concealment was made with the intent that it be relied upon; and (4) that the person to whom the representation was made, or from whom the facts were concealed, relied and acted upon the representation or concealment to his prejudice.

        The intent of the legislature in enacting this section was to extend the viability of judgments and, thus, increase the term of a child support judgment to a child’s twenty-third birthday. Thomas v. Worthington, 132 Idaho 825, 979 P.2d 1183 (1999) (see 2011 amendment).

        Where a district court judge incorrectly interpreted this section to include a complaint for renewal of judgment for past child support arrearages as an action or proceeding to collect past child support obligations, an attempt at execution of a judgment after the children reached their twenty-third birthdays was not within the statute of limitations. Thomas v. Worthington, 132 Idaho 825, 979 P.2d 1183 (1999) (see 2011 amendment).

      § 5-246. Prescriptive overflow easements.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In conformity with the limitations of actions time period set forth in sections 5-203 through 5-206, Idaho Code, the owner of a dam shall be deemed to have obtained a nonexclusive prescriptive overflow easement over real property which has been inundated or overflowed by the operations of the dam for at least a part of a year for any consecutive five (5) year period prior to commencement of an action by the property owner seeking relief inconsistent with such nonexclusive prescriptive overflow easement. Said dam owner shall be deemed to have not forfeited said nonexclusive prescriptive overflow easement if the reason for the failure to exercise the easement is a lack of water caused by drought or acts of God.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further provided that if a dam has inundated or overflowed real property for at least a part of a year for the five (5) consecutive years prior to the enactment of this section, then the owner of the dam shall be deemed to have obtained a nonexclusive prescriptive overflow easement hereunder over said real property one (1) year after the enactment of this section, provided, no action seeking relief inconsistent with such nonexclusive prescriptive overflow easement has been commenced by the property owner within one (1) year of the enactment of this section. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect the riparian and littoral rights of property owners to have access to and use of waters in this state, or to restrict any use of the underlying property for any purpose otherwise consistent with ownership thereof, even if said use reasonably interferes with the storage of water on the property, but said use shall not unreasonably interfere with the storage of water on the property. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect any prescriptive overflow easement that any dam owner may have previously acquired under common law. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to apply to the beds of navigable waters lying below the natural or ordinary high watermark as defined in subsection (c) of section 58-1302, Idaho Code, and subsection (9) of section 58-104, Idaho Code, or any other lands owned by the state of Idaho.

      When an infant or an insane or incompetent person is a party, he must appear either by his general guardian or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action is pending in each case.

        Infant must appear by guardian who must be made a party to the action and appear for his ward; infant’s representation by attorney is insufficient. Hutton v. Davis, 56 Idaho 231, 53 P.2d 345 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        There must be a pending action in which the infant has been served with process before the appointment of a guardian ad litem; the court must acquire jurisdiction over the infant before this section can apply; the appointment of a guardian ad litem is a matter of procedure and not of jurisdiction.

        The appointment of a guardian ad litem after the trial of a case and on the hearing of a motion for new trial, by an order of the trial court nunc pro tunc, is not a jurisdictional defect, but at most an irregularity which does not of itself vitiate the proceedings.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The effect of failure to appoint a guardian ad litem, where one is required by law, does not deprive the court of jurisdiction or power to act, and neither is the judgment rendered void; but a judgment rendered therein may be set aside thereafter on appropriate proceedings by the minor.

       <p>
        Since a guardian ad litem appointed under this section must act in the best interest of the child and not the parents, and it is absolutely essential that guardians are free to make such a determination without fear that a parent seeking a larger award or settlement will later sue the guardian for legal malpractice, guardians ad litem so appointed operate under the cloak of absolute quasi-judicial immunity; however, this does not leave the parties without recourse for they may object to the appointment or seek an appeal of a position adverse to that of the guardian or the court may reject the guardian’s recommendation or even remove a guardian who is not performing his duties.

        Legal Capacity to Sue.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Any person of sound mind, lawful age, and under no restraint or legal disability has the “legal capacity to sue,” which means the right to come into court and that the plaintiff is free from general disability such as infancy or insanity, or if he sues as a representative that he possess the character in which he sues. American Home Benefit Ass’n v. United Am. Benefit Ass’n, 63 Idaho 754, 125 P.2d 1010 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        A complaint is not demurrable on the ground that the plaintiff did not have the legal capacity to sue, where the complaint did not disclose that there was a legal disability of the plaintiff to prosecute the action, such as insanity, minority, or the like.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t05c03s5-311ol11">
       When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, his or her heirs or personal representatives on their behalf may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death, or in case of the death of such wrongdoer, against the personal representative of such wrongdoer, whether the wrongdoer dies before or after the death of the person injured. If any other person is responsible for any such wrongful act or neglect, the action may also be maintained against such other person, or in case of his or her death, his or her personal representatives. In every action under this section, such damages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case as may be just.
      </li>
      <li id="t05c03s5-311ol12">
       For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, and subsection (2) of section 5-327, Idaho Code, “heirs” means:

         Those persons who would be entitled to succeed to the property of the decedent according to the provisions of subsection (22) of section 15-1-201, Idaho Code.

         Whether or not qualified under subsection (2)(a) of this section, the decedent’s spouse, children, stepchildren, parents, and, when partly or wholly dependent on the decedent for support or services, any blood relatives and adoptive brothers and sisters. It includes the illegitimate child of a mother, but not the illegitimate child of the father unless the father has recognized a responsibility for the child’s support.
         <ol>
          <li id="t05c03s5-311ol12b1">
           “Support” includes contributions in kind as well as money.

          <li id="t05c03s5-311ol12b2">
           “Services” means tasks, usually of a household nature, regularly performed by the decedent that will be a necessary expense to the heirs of the decedent. These services may vary according to the identity of the decedent and heir and shall be determined under the particular facts of each case.
          </li>
         </ol>

         Whether or not qualified under subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b) of this section, the putative spouse of the decedent, if he or she was dependent on the decedent for support or services. As used in this subsection, “putative spouse” means the surviving spouse of a void or voidable marriage who is found by the court to have believed in good faith that the marriage to the decedent was valid.

        Wrongful death actions are designed to reimburse heirs for the expectations of parental beneficence they would have received, had the decedent lived; this regime does not allow for consideration of financial and other circumstances that arise subsequent to the death of a parent who is survived by heirs, such as plaintiff’s remarriage subsequent to the loss of her husband.

       <p>
        Heirs are determined at the date of death for purposes of this section, and the later execution of a renunciation document by a widow renouncing inheritance of her husband’s one-half of the community to her children does not alter that fact. Schiess v. Bates, 107 Idaho 794, 693 P.2d 440 (1984).

        Because the decedent’s own cause of action against an underinsured motorist abated upon her death, her personal representative, and heirs who were not insureds under the policy, were not entitled to payment for wrongful death, pursuant to her underinsured motorist coverage.

       <p>
        If a defendant would not be liable for injuries to the decedent had death not ensued, then there is no basis for recovery by the decedent’s heirs; therefore, if a defendant’s conduct does not make him liable to an injured party, then that defendant cannot be held liable in the event of death for damages resulting from the same conduct; thus, there was no basis for recovery of damages by the heirs of decedent where 50 percent of the negligence was apportioned to decedent. Bevan v. Vassar Farms, Inc., 117 Idaho 1038, 793 P.2d 711 (1990).
    It is reasonable, in a wrongful death action, to bar the heirs’ recovery against a defendant if the deceased himself could not recover. Bevan v. Vassar Farms, Inc., 117 Idaho 1038, 793 P.2d 711 (1990).

        Subsection (1) of this section is construed to use “personal representative” to mean the personal representative of the decedent, not of the heirs; thus, an action may be maintained for wrongful death of a person by the decedent’s heirs or the decedent’s personal representative on behalf of the heirs.

        In a wrongful death case, an older brother to the decedents fell within the definition of an “heir,” under subsection (2)(b), provided the older brother was partly or wholly dependent on the decedents for support or services; however, that support did not extend to the emotional and social support that the older brother claimed as damages, and the older brother did not have standing to recover.

Whitley v. Spokane & I.E.R.R., 23 Idaho 642, 132 P. 121 (1913), aff’d, 237 U.S. 487, 35 S. Ct. 655, 59 L. Ed. 1060 (1915).
    Former similar section was construed to have the same force and effect as if it had expressly provided that those claiming under decedent may recover only when the act would have entitled the person injured to recover had death not ensued. Helgeson v. Powell, 54 Idaho 667, 34 P.2d 957 (1934).

       <p>
        The action created by former similar section is not a survival action, but an action, the right to prosecute which did not accrue in the lifetime of decedent but only upon her death; hence, in the case of the deceased being a married woman, contention that an action in tort can not be maintained by a wife against her husband need not be considered. Russell v. Cox, 65 Idaho 534, 148 P.2d 221 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The cause of action which accrues to the injured party during his lifetime may be prosecuted or compromised by the injured party and the receipts inure to the benefit of his estate; whereas the right of action which accrues on the death of the injured party can only be prosecuted by her heirs or personal representatives and does not benefit the estate.

        The expression “as under the circumstances of the case, may be just” means such circumstances as are properly shown to the jury by the evidence under the pleadings, and the jury should be so instructed; the jury should not be permitted to assess damages on their own ideas and notions of what the “circumstances of the case” are, regardless of the pleadings and proof.

        It is not error for the court to instruct the jury that in considering the amount of pecuniary damages sustained by the plaintiff they may take into consideration “the degree of intimacy existing between the father and the child and the loss of companionship if such be shown”; moreover the jury is not limited to a precise and specific pecuniary amount measured by the direct evidence given in the case, but are at liberty to take into consideration, guided by the evidence given in the case, the intrinsic probabilities that damages have been sustained by and on account of the loss of bodily care or intellectual culture or moral training which the parent of the deceased had previously supplied or bestowed. Anderson v. Great N.R.R., 15 Idaho 513, 99 P. 91 (1908).
    In an action by father for the wrongful death of a son seven years of age, caused by collision on the railway, where it is admitted that the death occurred through the negligence and carelessness of the servants of the defendant, the value of the child’s services to the father during the period of his minority should be ascertained by the jury from the evidence introduced and by using their own judgment, common sense and discretion, as an estimate of such services must, of necessity, to a considerable extent be a matter of opinion. Golden v. Spokane & Inland Empire R.R., 20 Idaho 526, 118 P. 1076 (1911).

        Elements entering into the determination of damages for death of a child include: contributions which the parents might reasonably have expected to receive from the earnings of the deceased during his minority; and comfort, society and companionship deceased would have afforded to them had he lived; but grief and anguish are not to be considered. Checketts v. Bowman, 70 Idaho 463, 220 P.2d 682 (1950), overruled in part, Meissner v. Smith, 94 Idaho 563, 494 P.2d 567 (1972).

The legislature, in enacting the Uniform Probate Code, intended that the wrongful death statute be applied in the same manner as it always had been, that is “heirs” would be determined by reference to the intestate succession provision in effect at the time of death. Nebeker v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 113 Idaho 609, 747 P.2d 18 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “heirs,” as used in this section as it read prior to the revision in 1984, is defined to mean those who would take under the intestate provisions of the probate code in effect at the time of the decedent’s death. Nebeker v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 113 Idaho 609, 747 P.2d 18 (1987).

        Statutes authorizing actions for wrongful death are remedial in nature, designed to alleviate the harsh rule of common law that if an injured person died, his cause of action ceased to exist. Volk v. Baldazo, 103 Idaho 570, 651 P.2d 11 (1982).

        The fact that the wife predeceased the husband did not preclude a daughter as wife’s “heir” from recovering for wife’s death, under this section, on the theory that immediately on the wife’s death, the right of action was given to the husband, under the community property laws, and that such right of action was completely extinguished by the husband’s subsequent death.

        A 33-year-old daughter was not entitled to recover damages for the death of her 54-year-old mother, for whose death the father had recovered $10,000, where the daughter was married, lived with her own family, and there was no showing of a single visit by the daughter at the maternal home or of the relation existing between the daughter and the mother.

       </p>
       <p>
        As the Idaho death statute is a new right of action to a designated class of persons, i.e., the decedent’s heirs or personal representatives, the determination of who must bring the action depends upon substantive law and in a diversity action in federal district court the determination whether a third person was an indispensable party plaintiff to such action would have to be determined by the law of Idaho.

        Since the right of action is not given to the decedent’s estate, but is granted only to his heirs, denial to executor of right of recovery was not a deprival of equal protection of the law.

      § 5-319. Death or transfer of interest — Procedure — Actions by or against public officers.
     </h3>
     <p>
      An action or proceeding does not abate by the death or any disability of a party, or by the transfer of any interest therein, if the cause of action or proceeding survive or continue. In case of the death or any disability of a party, the court, on motion, may allow the action or proceeding to be continued by or against his representative or successor in interest. In case of any other transfer of interest the action or proceeding may be continued in the name of the original party, or the court may allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in the action or proceeding. An action or proceeding brought by or against any public officer in his official capacity and which action or proceeding is pending at the time of his death, resignation, retirement or removal from office does not abate. The court on its own motion or on motion for substitution may substitute the successor in office and allow the action or proceeding to be continued against such successor.

       </p>
       <p>
        Whether, as a matter of right, a successor in office may be substituted for his predecessor as a party to an appeal to the supreme court in a mandamus proceeding was not decided; but where substituted was granted since no objection was made and no substantial right violated, court upheld such substitution.

       <p>
        A decree of court quieting title in a suit commenced by decedent during his lifetime, wherein his administrator was substituted on his death, was not subject to collateral attack by the heirs of the decedent who were not joined in the quiet title action; the ground of the attack being that the parties in the suit to quiet title were different than those in the action in which the heirs attempted to attack the decree, since, although the heirs might have been substituted to quiet title, they were not required to be made parties.

Bruun v. Hanson, 103 F.2d 685 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 308 U.S. 571, 60 S. Ct. 86, 84 L. Ed. 479 (1939).

The order shall not be made except on the condition that the person possessing the property shall deliver the property or its value to the clerk of the court or to such custodian as the court may direct, and unless it appears from the affidavit of the person possessing the property, filed with the clerk with the motion, that such person or persons claiming makes or make such demand without collusion with the party possessing the property. The affidavit of such third person as to whether he makes such demand of the defendant may be read on the hearing of the motion.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person possessing the property who follows the procedure set forth above may insert in his motion for interpleader a request for allowance of his costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in such action. In ordering the discharge of such party, the court may, in its discretion, award such party his costs and reasonable attorney fees from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the court. At the time of final judgment in the action, the court may make such further provision for assumption of such costs and attorney fees by one (1) or more of the adverse claimants. At the same time, the court may, in its discretion, award to the person determined to be entitled to the property his costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees against an unsuccessful claimant if the claim asserted by said claimant was frivolous or without substantial merit.

      § 5-335. General rules of pleading — Claims for relief.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) if the court has limited jurisdiction, a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depends, (2) a short and plain statement of the claims showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader deems himself or herself entitled. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded. In any action for recovery because of personal injury or death, the claim for relief shall not specify the amount of damages claimed, but shall, instead, contain a general allegation of damage and shall state that the damages claimed are within any minimum or maximum jurisdictional limits of the court to which the pleading is addressed. At any time after service of the pleading, the defendant may, by special interrogatory, demand a statement of the amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff, which shall be answered within fifteen (15) days. The information provided in the response to the special interrogatory shall not be admissible into evidence at trial, nor shall it be communicated to the jury by argument or otherwise, nor shall it affect or limit the verdict rendered by the jury or the judgment issued by the court, in accordance with Idaho rule of civil procedure 54(c).

P. 9(g), these statutes and rule should be reconciled, if possible, so that the provisions of each will not be nullified. Rule 9(g) and this section suggest a way to do this. According to the rule, “no dollar amount or figure should be included in the complaint beyond a statement reciting that the jurisdictional amount established for filing the action is satisfied;” a similar general pleading should suffice to support a claim for attorney fees under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120</a></cite>(1). For example, the complaint could contain an appropriate general allegation that the plaintiff’s claim is within the jurisdictional limits of the district court, or magistrate’s division thereof. The complaint could separately allege that “plaintiff’s claim for damages does not exceed the limit set by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120</a></cite>(1) and plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney fees under this statute.” Such allegations would satisfy the jurisdictional pleading requirement and also afford a plaintiff—or defendant—an opportunity to recover attorney fees under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120</a></cite>(1) without contravening<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.05.html#t05c03s5-335" target="_blank">§ 5-335 </a></cite>or Idaho R.

Therefore, to invoke the entitlement to attorney fees pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120</a></cite>, the complaint should also allege that the plaintiff’s claim for damages does not exceed the limit established by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120 </a></cite>and that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-120" target="_blank">§ 12-120</a></cite>; since this allegation will not specify the precise amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff, it will not violate this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the action involved allegations that the land board both exceeded its authority and improperly exercised its authority, part of the cause of action arose in the county where the vast majority of the land in issue was located and the persons most directly affected lived; therefore, venue was proper in that county under subdivision 2 of this section, even though the land board made its decision in a different county. Priest Lake Coalition, Inc. v. State ex rel. Evans, 111 Idaho 354, 723 P.2d 898 (1986).
    Pursuant to subdivision 1, the magistrate court had venue of action regarding the suspension of driving privileges in the county where the defendant refused to submit to a blood test to determine the alcohol content of his blood. State v. Griffiths, 113 Idaho 364, 744 P.2d 92 (1987).

       <p>
        As a general rule, motion for change of venue is appearance in case. American Sur. Co. v. District Court, 43 Idaho 589, 254 P. 515 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Granting or refusing change of venue is within discretion of trial court. Spaulding v. Hoops, 49 Idaho 289, 287 P. 947 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        A formal motion in addition to demand is not an essential prerequisite to defendant’s right to change of venue. Anderson v. Springer, 78 Idaho 17, 296 P.2d 1024 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere filing of a request for change of venue does not deprive a judge of jurisdiction to hear the cause. Rudd v. Rudd, 105 Idaho 112, 666 P.2d 639 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant corporation’s waiver of venue in the county of its principle place of business was not sufficient to change venue. Pintlar Corp. v. Bunker Ltd. Partnership, 117 Idaho 152, 786 P.2d 543 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was evidence upon which the district court could properly find that a contract was created and breached in the county in which the complaint was filed, that the ensuing damages occurred there, and that an unjust enrichment claim and false labor lien claim arose in the same county, the district court properly exercised its discretion when it denied a motion for change of venue. Corder v. Idaho Farmway, Inc., 133 Idaho 353, 986 P.2d 1019 (Ct. App. 1999).

        This section should not be construed as limiting jurisdiction of district court in action commenced before it. American Sur. Co. v. District Court, 43 Idaho 589, 254 P. 515 (1927). Contracts Fixing Venue Invalid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contracts attempting to fix venue are invalid, as for example, a provision in a promissory note that it may be sued on in any county in the state. McCarty v. Herrick, 41 Idaho 529, 240 P. 192 (1925).

        Corporations.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A corporation does not have the right to have actions against it tried in the county in which its principal place of business is located, or in which the agent who may have been designated under the statute resides. Smith v. Inter-Mountain Auto Co., 25 Idaho 212, 136 P. 1125 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action against multiple corporations, venue was proper in the county where one of the defendants had its principle place of business, rather than in the county where the cause of action arose. Pintlar Corp. v. Bunker Ltd. Partnership, 117 Idaho 152, 786 P.2d 543 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was permissible for court to disregard defendant corporation’s principal place of business when it denied a change of venue motion since the corporation had been voluntarily dismissed as a party to the lawsuit by plaintiff; although defendant was dismissed subsequent to the motion for change of venue, the dismissal occurred before any of the defendants had filed either an answer or a motion for summary judgment. Ponderosa Paint Mfg., Inc. v. Yack, 125 Idaho 310, 870 P.2d 663 (Ct. App. 1994).

        District court had jurisdiction of complaint to determine custody of minor child, though neither plaintiff nor defendant were residents of county in which complaint was filed, where defendant a non-resident of the state, was served by summons in the county in which the complaint was filed. Clemens v. Kinsley, 72 Idaho 251, 239 P.2d 266 (1951).

        The venue of a divorce action falls under this section. Finnell v. Finnell, 59 Idaho 148, 81 P.2d 401 (1938); Rudd v. Rudd, 105 Idaho 112, 666 P.2d 639 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        A divorce is sui generis with the marital relationship, the res of the action, and is ambulatory with the person of one or the other of spouses. Finnell v. Finnell, 59 Idaho 148, 81 P.2d 401 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case the action is brought in the wrong county, defendant has the right to have the cause transferred to the county of his residence. Finnell v. Finnell, 59 Idaho 148, 81 P.2d 401 (1938).

        Action to foreclose chattel mortgage joining an action in conversion against parties who are alleged to have converted part of the chattels was properly brought in the county where the remaining chattels were situated, rather than in county of defendant’s residence.

       <p>
        Where bank’s only viable cause of action in the foreclosure of a senior trust deed was an action on the note, the district court did not err in denying a change of venue from county where debtor resided to another county. First Interstate Bank v. Eisenbarth, 123 Idaho 895, 853 P.2d 640 (Ct. App. 1993). Foreign Corporations.
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determining venue, a foreign corporation must be regarded as a resident of the county where it maintains its principal place of business in the state, subject to the choice of plaintiff in cases where the action may be maintained in either of two or more counties and to the power of the court to change the place of trial as provided in the code.

        The common-law rule that libel suit may be brought in any county in which a paper is circulated was abrogated by this section and the action must be brought where the paper is published. O’Malley v. Statesman Printing Co., 60 Idaho 326, 91 P.2d 357 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a newspaper was composed, printed, and published in Ada County, and immediately after being put into type, the alleged libelous article was printed in the paper and copies thereof were circulated in all counties of the state, not less than 7,000 in number in Ada County, and approximately 70 in Bannock County, where the plaintiff resided, the plaintiff’s cause of action arose in Ada County, and not in Bannock County; and where the suit was filed in Bannock County, the defendant was entitled to a change of venue to Ada County. O’Malley v. Statesman Printing Co., 60 Idaho 326, 91 P.2d 357 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action for libel may be properly tried in the county wherein the defendants reside in accord with this section; on the other hand, the defendants may waive their right to have the action tried in the county of their residence. Bistline v. Eberle, 85 Idaho 167, 376 P.2d 501 (1962).

        A lis pendens does not create a lien; it’s purpose is simply to give notice of the pendency of a lawsuit affecting the title or the right to possession of real property to subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers of the property who have not actual knowledge of the action or of the claim upon which it is based.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where formal notices of lis pendens operated in the nature of recorded liens on property, yet it was clear from the record that none of the property which had been so encumbered was involved in the actions against property owners, the doctrine of lis pendens was wholly inapplicable and the liens and lis pendens were dissolved and ordered expunged from the record. Eismann v. Miller, 101 Idaho 692, 619 P.2d 1145 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The removal of a lis pendens, as the result of a settlement or judgment, has no effect on legal rights; it simply is a signal that a dispute over those rights has been resolved. Jerry J. Joseph C.L.U. Ins. Assocs. v. Vaught, 117 Idaho 555, 789 P.2d 1146 (Ct. App. 1990).

        If a third-party acquires rights to property before receiving actual notice that an action affecting the property has been filed, or before a notice of lis pendens has been filed, the third-party is not bound by the subsequent judgment or decree entered in the action, unless it is made a party to the action.

       <p>
        The filing of a lis pendens is necessary only for the purpose of giving record notice to subsequent purchasers or incumbrancers of the property, who do not have actual knowledge of the action or of the claim upon which it is based; one who has actual knowledge is not entitled to insist that the filing of a lis pendens was necessary. Smith v. Faris-Kesl Constr. Co., 27 Idaho 407, 150 P. 25 (1915).

        Subdivision (a) of this section is designed to provide a forum for in-state residents in a world of increasingly complex commercial transactions and, since it is remedial in nature, should be broadly construed.

        In order for jurisdiction to be obtained over an out-of-state defendant, the act giving rise to the cause of action must fall within the scope of this state’s long-arm jurisdiction and the constitutional standards of due process must be met.

        The fact that plaintiff’s place of business was in Idaho had no significance in determining whether Idaho may exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant; it is defendant’s activities, not plaintiff’s location, that must be considered.

        Sections 5-514 — 5-517 are designed to provide a forum for Idaho residents and are remedial legislation of the most fundamental nature; therefore, they are to be liberally construed. Doggett v. Electronics Corp. of Am., 93 Idaho 26, 454 P.2d 63 (1969); Duignan v. A.H. Robins Co., 98 Idaho 134, 559 P.2d 750 (1977).

        Subdivision (a) of this section is designed to provide a forum for in-state residents in a world of increasingly complex commercial transactions and, since it is remedial in nature, should be broadly construed.

        Because jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to decide disputes and to compel parties to come before it, a court in ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction must determine whether it has power to hear the complaint rather than utilize a forum non conveniens analysis.

        In suit against ex-wife and her attorney alleging numerous tort claims against the parties involved in taking custody of child where defendant attorney allegedly had known for 16 months that child was in Idaho before he obtained ex parte custody order in California in order that such order could be used in Idaho to obtain assistance of Idaho law and officials in obtaining custody of child and where alleged injury to plaintiffs arose out of his acts in procuring such order, Idaho assertion of jurisdiction over defendant was within accord with the constitutional principals of due process and defendant’s conduct in procuring such order for use in Idaho was sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over him. Lake v. Lake, 817 F.2d 1416 (9th Cir. 1987).
    Where activities by the principals of a joint venture as agents of each other were business transactions meant to further the joint venture’s pecuniary interest, the statutory basis for personal jurisdiction over defendant, who was a principal of the joint venture, was established. State Dep’t of Fin. v. Tenney, 124 Idaho 243, 858 P.2d 782 (Ct. App. 1993).

        The exercise of personal jurisdiction by Idaho courts over an out-of-state limited liability company (LLC) was proper where, by contracting with an in-state company, after being notified of the company’s presence in Idaho and of the company’s desire to perform contractual duties there, the LLC purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protection of Idaho laws. H2O Envtl. Inc. v. Proimtu MMI, LLC, 162 Idaho 368, 397 P.3d 398 (2017).

        In order for an Idaho court to exert jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, two criteria must be met; the act giving rise to the cause of action must fall within the scope of this section and the constitutional standards of due process must be met.

        The following acts were not enough to establish personal jurisdiction over broker because they do not show he purposefully availed himself of privilege of conducting activities within the state: 1) corporation for whom broker was procuring loan had principal place of business in state; 2) broker acquired statistical information from banks in state; 3) broker visited state to overlook land to be used as security; and 4) the final loan proposal was secured by land outside the state.

        Where state’s only interest was that plaintiff was a resident of Idaho, it would violate due process to subject the department of social services of another state, Missouri, and its employees, to Idaho’s jurisdiction, even on the limited issue of enjoining them from falsely reporting to third parties that the plaintiff is indebted for child support.

       <p>
        For Idaho courts to have personal jurisdiction, an act must fall within Idaho’s long arm statute and due process rights must not be offended. Idaho has held that defamatory matter published in the due course of a judicial proceeding, having some reasonable relation to the cause, is absolutely privileged and will not support a civil action for defamation. The privilege applies even if the defamatory statements were made maliciously and with knowledge of its falsity. The term judicial proceeding is not restricted to trials, but includes every proceeding of a judicial nature before a court or official clothed with judicial or quasi-judicial power. Dickinson Frozen Foods, Inc. v. J.R. Simplot Co., 164 Idaho 669, 434 P.3d 1275 (2019). — Procedure.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of personal jurisdiction, service of process under this section is ineffective. Donaldson v. Donaldson, 111 Idaho 951, 729 P.2d 426 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant could have raised the defense of lack of jurisdiction over his person by a pre-answer motion or in the answer itself, his failure to so raise the defense of lack of jurisdiction over his person constituted a waiver of that defense. Quintana v. Quintana, 119 Idaho 1, 802 P.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A resident of the state could not rely on section 7-1004 to argue that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him, since that section defines the basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents in proceedings to establish, enforce, or modify a support order or to determine parentage. State Dep’t of Health &amp; Welfare ex rel. Oregon v. Conley, 132 Idaho 266, 971 P.2d 332 (Ct. App. 1999).

        Where an insurer sued an aircraft parts manufacturer in strict liability or negligence for selling defective switches causing an aircraft to crash, and the manufacturer sold products solely to a non-forum state aircraft builder, knowing that the aircraft were distributed nationally and specifically in the forum state, the court adopted the insurer’s version of facts, construed its allegations in a light most favorable to the insurer, and noted the remedial nature of the statute, and found that the insurer showed a prima facie case of jurisdiction under subsection (b).

        The purpose of the legislature in including divorce actions as being within the purview of the long-arm statute was to extend the in personam jurisdiction of the courts of this state in divorce cases over those defendants who were maintaining matrimonial domicile in this state when the cause of action for divorce arose. Baker v. Baker, 100 Idaho 635, 603 P.2d 590 (1979).

        One contact with Idaho consisting of out-of-state manufacture by out-of-state defendants of boiler components which injured plaintiff in Idaho was sufficient to give Idaho jurisdiction over such defendants in ensuing tort action.

       <p>
        Where plaintiff, while resident of South Dakota, was treated by South Dakota doctor and, after she moved to Idaho, the doctor sent copies of original prescriptions to her in Idaho, the alleged injury by use of drugs did not constitute commission of tort by the doctor within the state of Idaho which would confer jurisdiction under this section. Wright v. Yackley, 459 F.2d 287 (9th Cir. 1972).

        For jurisdiction, the physical presence of an out-of-state corporation is not required if an independent contractor representing the out-of-state corporation in the transaction sued upon has been physically present in the state.

        Where the defendant Pennsylvania corporation carried on no activity whatsoever in Idaho and did not even conduct business with an Idaho corporation or resident, the mere fact that the corporation once sold a helicopter to a second Pennsylvania corporation and the helicopter was later purchased by an Idaho corporation and ultimately killed an Idaho resident did not constitute “minimum contacts” within the state of Idaho; and therefore, due process prohibited the exercise of in personam jurisdiction over the defendant corporation. Schneider v. Sverdsten Logging Co., 104 Idaho 210, 657 P.2d 1078 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that the defendant Pennsylvania corporation, whose business was servicing helicopters, had no agents in the state of Idaho, that it had never done business in Idaho, that it had injected no products into the interstate “stream of commerce,” and that it had not attempted to serve an Idaho market by means of its advertising, the defendant corporation had insufficient contacts with the state of Idaho for an Idaho court to exercise in personam jurisdiction over it consistent with due process principles. Schneider v. Sverdsten Logging Co., 104 Idaho 210, 657 P.2d 1078 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The out-of-state defendant corporation had sufficient minimum contacts with this state such that the assertion of jurisdiction was fair, where the defendant deliberately reached out to negotiate with a corporation in this state and executed a contract which established a relationship of some months with the plaintiff, and compelling trial in this state 200 miles from the county seat of the defendant’s home office was not unreasonable. Beco Corp. v. Roberts & Sons Constr. Co., 114 Idaho 704, 760 P.2d 1120 (1988), overruled on other grounds by Houghland Farms, Inc. v. Johnson, 119 Idaho 72, 803 P.2d 978 (1990), to the extent it conflicts with Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985).

        Mere personal presence in Idaho at one time is not sufficient in and of itself to form the basis for the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over a person who is later served process outside the state; here there were not sufficient other activities of defendant in Idaho to be enhanced by this one isolated event.

Southern Idaho Pipe & Steel Co. v. Cal-Cut Pipe & Supply, Inc., 98 Idaho 495, 567 P.2d 1246 (1977), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, 434 U.S. 1056, 98 S. Ct. 1225, 55 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1978).

        Where, in action for breach of contract, warranty and tort duties in manufacture of concrete pouring equipment and forms, it was shown that one defendant sent a service technician to Idaho work site for three days and that the other defendant gave plaintiff instructions in Idaho and its field representative spent a week there conducting tests and making representations in connection with defendant’s business, including ordering a new form, the transfer of the entire case to the United States district court in Idaho was proper since all of the events and most of the contract giving rise to the claim occurred in Idaho so that jurisdiction over the person of both defendants was established.

        The defendant’s conduct of negotiating a contract price with the plaintiff agreeing that the plaintiff should draft the agreement, executing the document over the plaintiff’s signature, and mailing the contract back to this state fell within the definition of “transaction of any business within this state”; and the fact that the defendant maintained no physical presence in this state did not affect the applicability of this section. Beco Corp. v. Roberts & Sons Constr. Co., 114 Idaho 704, 760 P.2d 1120 (1988), overruled on other grounds by Houghland Farms, Inc. v.

        The acquisition of statistical information by out-of-state defendant loan company, concerning plaintiff corporation, from various banks in Idaho, had no significance in determining whether defendant invoked the benefits and protections of the laws of Idaho, nor did the fact that defendant visited plaintiff’s Idaho properties to be able more fully to acquaint himself with the security that would be offered for a potential loan have any such significance.

    Where there is no applicable federal statute governing personal jurisdiction, the law of the state in which the district court sits applies. Because this section allows a broader application of personal jurisdiction than the Due Process Clause, the court need look only to the Due Process Clause to determine personal jurisdiction.

        State’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a native American cigarette retailer fully complied with due process; where the retailer’s importation of 100 million non-compliant cigarettes satisfied the requirements of the long-arm statute and the retailer was conducting business in the state, even though it was selling only to a company owned by a member of a Native American tribe. State v. Native Wholesale Supply Co., 155 Idaho 337, 312 P.3d 1257 (2013).
