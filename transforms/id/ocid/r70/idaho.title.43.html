      Whenever fifty (50), or a majority, of the holders of title, or evidence of title, to lands susceptible of one or more modes of irrigation from the same or different sources and by the same or different systems of works, desire to provide for the irrigation of the same, or when for other reasons they desire to organize the proposed territory into one district, they may propose the organization of an irrigation district under this title: provided, said formation into one (1) district meets with the approval of fifty (50), or a majority of the holders of title, or evidence of title, to lands in each of the communities affected: provided, further, said holders of title or evidence of title shall hold such title or evidence of title to at least one-fourth (¼) part of the total area of the land in the proposed district, exclusive of state and government land which will be assessable for the purposes of the district. The equalized county assessment roll next preceding the presentation of a petition for the organization of an irrigation district shall be sufficient evidence of title for the purpose of this title, but other evidence may be received, including receipts or other evidence of the rights of entrymen on lands under any law of the United States or of this state, and such entrymen shall be competent signers of such petition, and the lands on which they have made such entries shall, for the purposes of said petition, be considered as owned by them.

     <p>
      A corporation, the stock of which is owned entirely by natural persons related by blood or affinity, a limited liability company, in which all the members are natural persons related by blood or affinity, a partnership, in which all the partners are natural persons related by blood or affinity, and a trust, in which all of the beneficiaries are natural persons related by blood or affinity, shall have the same rights and privileges in the conduct of irrigation district business as do natural persons, including, but not limited to, voting in elections and signing petitions. A corporation shall vote or otherwise act through its majority shareholder; a limited liability company shall vote or otherwise act, if member-managed, through its member and, if manager-managed, through its manager; a partnership shall vote or otherwise act through its majority partner; a trust shall vote or otherwise act through its trustee. For voting purposes the residence of such person shall establish the residence of the corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust. If there is no single majority stockholder, no single majority member, no single manager, no single majority partner or no single trustee, then the corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust must furnish the irrigation district a written designation stating the name of the stockholder, manager or member, partner or trustee who is authorized to vote and otherwise act for the corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust, respectively. If the majority or designated stockholder, manager or member, partner or trustee is married, his or her spouse shall have the same rights and privileges in the conduct of irrigation district business as do the spouses of individual land owners in the district. A person, or the spouse of a person, voting for a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust shall not be entitled to vote again as an individual.

An election shall be held in the district each year thereafter in accordance with section 34-106, Idaho Code, to elect directors to succeed those whose terms expire. Each director’s term of office shall commence on the regularly scheduled board meeting closest to the date specified for taking office in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and shall continue for a term of three (3) years and until their successors are elected and qualified. If no director is elected and qualified at the end of an incumbent director’s three (3) year term, an election shall be held at the next regular election of the irrigation district for the incumbent director’s successor to hold office for the remainder of the unexpired term. This election requirement shall apply retroactively where an incumbent director remains in office on the date of the effective date of this act because the incumbent’s successor was not elected and qualified in the 2012 election.

Each clerk shall write down each office to be filled, and the name of each person voted for such office, and shall keep the number of votes by tallies as they are read by such chairman or judge. The counting of the votes shall continue without adjournment until all the votes have been counted.

     <p>
      Whenever any legal voter of the irrigation district, either individually or on behalf of an organization, desires to demand the recall and discharge of a director of an irrigation district, under the provisions of article VI, section 6, of the constitution of the state of Idaho, he shall prepare a typewritten petition. The petition may recite that the director has wilfully neglected or failed to perform faithfully a duty imposed by law; or acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner; or has committed an unlawful act; or has wrongfully acted so as to interfere with, interrupt, or adversely affect the performance of his official duty; or has violated his oath of office. The petition may describe the act or acts complained of, if applicable, in concise language, give a detailed description including the approximate date, location and nature of each act complained of, be signed by the person making the charge, give his respective post office address and be verified, under oath, that he believes the charge or charges to be true and that he has knowledge of the alleged facts relating to the charges if any have been alleged in the recall petition.

        § 43-305. Drainage of lands — Payment of cost — Apportionment of cost when payment deferred.
       </h3>
       <p>
        Any irrigation district heretofore organized or hereafter to be organized, may, whenever it appears necessary, proper or beneficial to drain any of the lands within said district, whether for the benefit of the land actually requiring drainage or for the protection of other lands within said district, whether the irrigation works have been actually acquired or constructed or not, cause drainage canals and works to be constructed and to this end such district shall in all respects have the same power and authority as is now conferred or may hereafter be conferred respecting irrigation, and all the powers conferred upon irrigation districts under the laws of this state with respect to irrigation shall be construed to include drainage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any irrigation district now, or which may hereafter be organized under the laws of the state of Idaho, shall have the authority to construct drainage works for the purpose of draining any land or lands within such irrigation district, and such authority shall be exercised by the board of directors in its discretion. The cost of any such drainage works may be paid for out of the maintenance, operation charges, tolls, or assessments, or out of either or all of such funds which are not otherwise necessary for the purposes for which such funds were created; that not to exceed twenty per cent (20%) of the total amount of such maintenance, operation charges, tolls and assessments for any year shall be expended for drainage.
       </p>
       <p>
        In all cases where the construction of drainage works requires the issuance of bonds or such works are constructed by the United States under a contract by which the payments therefor are deferred, the board of directors of such irrigation district shall apportion the cost of such drainage works to each tract of land in said district according to benefits. In determining the amount to be apportioned to each tract of benefits under this section, the board of directors may consider benefits to each tract drained; the damage done to the low land from seepage and saturation from irrigation water from high land, and the necessity for carrying off waste water, and such high land may be considered as being benefited to the extent and in the amount that such lands are responsible for damage to low lands from seepage and saturation by irrigation water; the board may also consider any advantage to the lands of the district and each tract thereof, growing out of the construction of such drainage works. In lieu of issuing bonds or contracting with the United States for the construction of drainage works, the board of directors may consider such drainage works as a part of the irrigation system and may make levies to pay for the same upon the same basis as assessments for the construction of the irrigation works by which the lands of the district are irrigated. In all cases where the cost of drainage works shall be apportioned to all the tracts of lands of the district as herein provided, all the provisions of this title applicable to procedure and the confirmation of the apportionment by the court, including the right of appeal, shall be applicable to the apportionment of benefits under this section.

The resolution calling the election shall prescribe an official notice of election, which notice shall be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, the last publication of which shall be at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for said election, in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published within the district, and no other or further notice of such election or publication of the names of election officers or of the precincts or polling places need be given or made.

      § 43-318A. Trade-in or exchange of district property.

     <p>
      Whenever the board of directors of an irrigation district finds and by resolution declares that the district no longer has use for any personal property of the district, or finds and declares that such property is no longer economical to use, the district may, in lieu of the sale of said property as provided in section 43-318, Idaho Code, dispose of the property by exchanging the same in part payment for new or replacement property.

      If the acquisition of the new or replacement property is required to be let to bid under the provisions of chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code, the district shall include in its request for bids, a full description of the property to be exchanged as part payment, and shall permit any interested bidder to examine the same, and any contract let as a result of said bid shall be awarded on the basis of net cost to the district after allowance for the property to be exchanged in part payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Exchange of property will be permitted only when, in the opinion of the board of directors of the district, the sale of the property under the provisions of section 43-318, Idaho Code, will yield a lesser monetary return to the district than the exchange thereof as herein provided.

      § 43-321. Special assessments — Elections — Collection of assessments — Delinquent list.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of directors may, at any time when in their judgment it may be advisable, call a special election and submit to the qualified electors of the district the question whether or not a special assessment shall be levied for the purpose of raising money to be applied to any of the purposes provided in this title, and shall, at the same time, fix a date upon which such assessment shall become delinquent, which date shall be not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days from the date of said meeting of said board. Such election must be called upon the notice prescribed, and the same shall be held, and the result thereof determined and declared, in all respects in conformity with the provisions of section 43-401[, Idaho Code]. The notice must specify the amount of money proposed to be raised, and the purpose for which it is intended to be used. At such elections the ballots shall contain the words “Assessment . . . . yes” or “Assessment . . . . no.” If two-thirds (2/3) or more of the votes cast are “Assessment . . . . yes,” the board shall immediately levy an assessment sufficient to raise the amount voted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessment so levied shall be computed and entered on the assessment roll by the secretary of the board, and within ten (10) days after such assessment, the secretary must deliver the assessment book to the treasurer of the district who shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of such book, publish a notice in a newspaper published in each county in which any portion of the district may lie, that said assessments are due and payable and will become delinquent at six o’clock p.m. of the day fixed by the board of directors, naming such day and date, and also the times and places at which the payment of the assessment may be made; which notice shall be published for a period of two (2) weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The treasurer must attend at the times and places specified in the notice to receive assessments which must be paid in lawful money of the United States. Within fifteen (15) days after the delinquent date as fixed by the board of directors, said treasurer shall begin the preparation of the delinquent list, which delinquent list shall contain a description of all the tracts of land upon which such special assessments are delinquent, and the amount of such assessment against each of the said tracts, and the name of the owner as shown on the assessment book. And on or before thirty (30) days thereafter, the treasurer shall complete said delinquent list, shall properly certify the same, and prepare a duplicate thereof; and deliver the delinquent list to the secretary of the district. At the same time the treasurer must commence to publish the delinquent list and publication shall continue three (3) weeks and must contain the names of the owners, a description of the property delinquent at that time, the amount of assessments and penalties and the costs due, opposite each name and description. After said publication shall have been made for the first time the treasurer shall collect twenty-five (25) cents in addition to the assessment and penalties on each description of lands published. The treasurer must append and publish with the delinquent list a notice that unless the assessments delinquent, together with penalties and costs, are paid, the real property upon which said assessments are made will be sold at public auction on the first Tuesday in September following date of notice. The publication must be made in some newspaper published in the district, if it can be so published, and if it cannot be so published, then in some newspaper published in the county in which the office of the board of directors is situated; and if it cannot be so published, then by posting in not less than three (3) places in said district, one (1) of which shall be at the door of the office of said board of directors.
    The place of such sale shall be at the office of said board of directors. The treasurer, as soon as he has made the publication required, must file with the secretary proof of such publication by affidavit, or like proof of posting in case such notice was posted as herein required. Such sales and all proceedings thereafter shall be in accordance with the provisions of sections 4392 to 4401, both inclusive, of Idaho Compiled Statutes, where not in conflict herewith.
     </p>
     <p>
      When collected such assessments shall be paid into the district treasury for the purposes provided in the notice of such special election.

      § 43-322. Power to incur debts — Warrants.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of directors, or other officers of the district, shall have no power to incur any debt or liability whatever, either by issuing bonds or otherwise, in excess of the express provisions of this section; and any debt or liability incurred in excess of such express provisions shall be and remain absolutely void: provided, that for the purpose of organization, or for any of the purposes of this title, the board of directors may, before the collection of the first assessment, incur indebtedness and cause warrants of the district to issue therefor according to the following limitations: Districts embracing fifty thousand (50,000) acres, or more, of irrigable land, not in excess of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) of warrants; districts embracing forty thousand (40,000) acres, or more, and less than fifty thousand (50,000) acres of irrigable land, up to twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) of warrants; districts embracing thirty thousand (30,000) acres, or more, and less than forty thousand (40,000) acres of irrigable land, up to nine thousand dollars ($9,000) of warrants; districts embracing twenty thousand (20,000) acres, or more, and less than thirty thousand (30,000) acres of irrigable land, up to six thousand dollars ($6,000) of warrants; districts embracing ten thousand (10,000) acres, or more, and less than twenty thousand (20,000) acres of irrigable land, up to four thousand dollars ($4,000) of warrants; districts embracing more than two thousand (2,000) acres, or more, and less than ten thousand (10,000) acres of irrigable land up to three thousand dollars ($3,000) of warrants, and districts embracing less than two thousand (2,000) acres of irrigable land up to two thousand dollars ($2,000) of warrants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, further, that for the purpose of defraying the expenses in the care, operation, repair and improvement of such portion of the irrigation works of the district as are completed and in use, including salaries of officers and employees, the board of directors of an irrigation district may at any time issue warrants of such district in payment of claims of indebtedness against the district, not to exceed the district’s anticipated revenue.
     </p>
     <p>
      The warrants herein authorized shall be in form and substance the same as county warrants or as near the same as may be practicable and shall be signed by the chairman and attested by the secretary of said board. All such warrants shall be presented by the holder thereof to the treasurer of the district for payment who shall indorse thereon the day of presentation for payment with the additional indorsement thereon, in case of nonpayment, that they are not paid for want of funds, and such warrants shall draw interest at a rate to be established by the board of directors from the date of their presentation to the treasurer for payment as aforesaid until such warrants are paid. No warrants shall be issued in payment of any indebtedness of such district for less than face or par value. It shall be the duty of the treasurer from time to time when he has sufficient funds in his hands for that purpose to advertise in some newspaper in the county in which the district is situated requiring the presentation to him for payment of as many of the outstanding warrants as he may be able to pay. Ten (10) days after the first publication of said notice by the treasurer calling in any of said outstanding warrants, said warrants shall cease to bear interest, which shall be stated in the notice. Said notice shall be published two (2) weeks consecutively and said warrants shall be called in and paid in the order of their indorsement.
    Provided, further, after an irrigation district has organized and has no warrants outstanding, the district may maintain its operation on a cash basis and pay by check the expenses of operation and maintenance, repair, improvement, obligations on contractual or bonded indebtedness, and all other general necessary expenses incurred by the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of directors, or other officers of the district, may incur debt by contracting indebtedness with a money-lending institution, subject to the election requirements contained in section 43-401, Idaho Code, or as described in section 42-322A, Idaho Code, but the term of such indebtedness shall not exceed thirty (30) years.

       The board may by resolution adopted by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the board, determine that the interest of the district and the public interest and necessity demand the development and operation of a mitigation plan or recharge project and shall set forth the amount of obligation or contract indebtedness proposed to be issued by the district under the provisions of this chapter for the development of such mitigation plan or recharge project. The board shall submit the contract indebtedness in the proposed resolution to a vote of the qualified electors of the district as defined in section 43-111, Idaho Code, at an election to be held only if within fifteen (15) days after the passage of such resolution a referendum petition signed by qualified electors of the district whose aggregate water rights equal not less than ten percent (10%), calculated on a per acre basis, of the aggregate water rights of all qualified electors of the district, shall be filed with the secretary of the district requesting that an election upon the issuance of the contract indebtedness be held and conducted under the provisions of this section. Any election required to be held pursuant to a referendum petition filed in accordance with this section for the purpose of submitting any proposition or propositions of incurring such obligation or indebtedness shall be held in accordance with section 34-106, Idaho Code. The resolution, in addition to such declaration of public interest or necessity, shall recite the objects and purposes for which the indebtedness is proposed to be incurred, the estimated cost of the mitigation plan or recharge plan, the amount of principal of the indebtedness to be incurred therefor, and the sources of the revenues and assessments pledged to the payment of the indebtedness. The separate election upon the assessments shall be held at the same time as and shall be combined with any such election required to be held upon the indebtedness question pursuant to a referendum petition. If no referendum petition is filed, or if so filed, if it shall appear from the returns that the qualified electors of the district representing two-thirds (2/3) of the aggregate water rights of the district, calculated on a per acre basis, have voted in favor of the proposition, the district thereupon shall be authorized to incur such indebtedness or obligations, or enter into such contracts, all for the purposes provided for in the proposition submitted in the resolution, and in the amount so provided subject to judicial examination as provided in subsection (2) of this section. Submission of the proposition of incurring such obligation or other indebtedness at such an election shall not prevent or prohibit submission of the same or other propositions at subsequent election or elections called for such purpose.

       Prior to the incurring of indebtedness, the board of directors of the irrigation district shall file in the district court of the county in which their office is situated a petition, praying in effect that the proceedings aforesaid may be examined, approved and confirmed by the court. The petition shall state generally that the irrigation district was duly organized and the first board of directors elected, that due and lawful proceedings were taken to authorize the incurrence of indebtedness by the issuance of bonds or otherwise for mitigation plans or recharge projects in an amount to be stated, and that said assessment, list and apportionment were duly made and a copy of said assessment, list and apportionment shall be attached to said petition. Whenever any district that is required to file a petition hereunder has or proposes to enter into a contract or contracts with one (1) or more districts or ground water district, the boards of such other districts or ground water districts may join in the filing of such petition, and the district court in which such petition is filed shall have jurisdiction to hear the petition and to grant the relief prayed for therein. Each such petition shall pray for a judicial examination and determination of any power conferred hereby or by any amendment hereto or of any assessment levied or of any apportionment of costs or of any act, proceeding or contract of the district or districts, whether or not said contracts shall have been executed, including, without limitation, proposed contracts for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, replacement and improvement of any well and other related structures and works and appurtenances, falling water contracts, contracts with other districts and contracts with other public and private persons, firms, corporations and associations associated with mitigation plans or recharge projects. Such petition shall set forth the facts whereon the validity of such powers, assessments, apportionments, acts, proceedings or contracts is founded. Notice of the filing of said petition shall be given by the clerk of the court in accordance with the requirements of section 43-407, Idaho Code, stating in brief outline the contents of the petition and showing where a full copy of any contract or contracts, therein mentioned, may be examined.

       Any water user in any district joining in the petition or any other person interested in the contracts or proposed contracts may appear and answer the petition at any time prior to the date fixed for the hearing or within such further time as may be allowed by the court; and the petition shall be taken as confessed by all persons who fail so to appear. The said petition and notice shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction and, upon hearing, the court: shall examine into and determine all matters and things affecting the question submitted; shall examine all of the proceedings of all of the districts as set forth in the petition; shall hear all objections either filed in the proceeding or brought up from the hearings before any of the boards; shall correct all errors in the assessments and apportionments of costs; shall ratify, approve and confirm all apportionments of costs and assessments levied; shall make such findings with reference thereto and render a judgment and decree thereon approving and confirming all of the powers, assessments, apportionments, acts, proceedings and contracts of each of the districts as set forth in the petition as the case warrants. Costs may be divided or apportioned among the contesting parties in the discretion of the trial court. Review of the judgment of the court may be had as in other similar cases.

Notwithstanding the filing of such map, only the legal description of an irrigation district’s boundaries recorded in compliance with title 43, Idaho Code, shall constitute conclusive proof of the district’s boundaries for purposes other than defining the generally described place of use for a water right held by the district.

     <p>
      The holders of title, or evidence of title, representing a majority of the acreage of any body of land within any irrigation district, may file with the board of directors of the district a petition in writing, praying for the construction of any improvement necessary or expedient for the efficient irrigation of the lands, including facilities for the recharge of ground water basins. The petition shall in a general way describe the proposed improvement and shall describe the tracts, or body of land, owned by the petitioners, and shall contain a description of the exterior boundaries of the land for which the proposed improvement is to be constructed, and describing therein any lands that are to be excepted from the benefit or use of the proposed improvement. The petition shall also contain an agreement on the part of the petitioners that the cost of construction of the improvement shall constitute a lien upon the lands within the exterior boundaries of the land described in the petition, except the lands that are therein excepted from the benefit or use of the proposed improvement, and that the lands shall be assessed for and pay the cost of the improvement. The petition shall be deemed to give assent of the petitioners to construction of the improvement and shall authorize the assessment of the cost of such improvement upon and against the lands described in the petition and not specifically therein excepted. The petition shall be acknowledged in the same manner that conveyances of land are required to be acknowledged.

      § 43-401. Plan of construction — Issuance of bonds — Indebtedness — Election.
     </h3>
     <p>
      As soon as practicable after the organization of any such district the board of directors shall, by a resolution entered on its records, formulate a general plan of its proposed operations, in which it shall state what constructed works or other property it proposes to purchase and the cost of purchasing the same; and further what construction work it proposes to do and how it proposes to raise the funds for carrying out said plan. For the purpose of ascertaining the cost of any such construction work, said board shall cause such surveys, examinations and plans to be made as shall demonstrate the practicability of such plan, and furnish the proper basis for an estimate of the cost of carrying out the same. All such surveys, examinations, maps, plans and estimates, shall be made under the direction of a competent irrigation engineer and certified by him. Said board shall then submit a copy of the same to the department of water resources, and within ninety (90) days thereafter the department shall file a report upon the same with said board, which report shall contain such matters as, in the judgment of the department may be desirable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receiving said report said board of directors shall proceed to determine the amount of money necessary to be raised, and shall immediately thereafter call a special election, at which shall be submitted to the electors of said district possessing the qualifications hereinafter prescribed the question whether or not the bonds of said district, or the right to enter into an obligation with the United States in the manner hereinafter in this title provided, or whether a contractual arrangement with a money-lending institution in the amount as determined, shall be authorized.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of such election must be given by posting notices in three (3) public places in each election precinct in said district at least four (4) weeks before the date of said election, and by publication of the same once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation within the district. Notice given by publication in a weekly newspaper shall be published in four (4) consecutive issues thereof, or if in a daily newspaper, at least six (6) days shall elapse between the first and last dates of publication, and in either case, publication shall be completed not less than fifteen (15) days before the election. Such notice must specify the time of holding the election, the qualifications of voters, the amount of bonds proposed to be issued, and, in case such maps and estimates have been made, it shall further state that copies thereof, and in all cases it shall state that said report of the department of water resources, are on file and open to public inspection by the people of the district, at the office of said board and at the office of the department of water resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person who is not a resident holder of title or evidence of title to lands located and subject to assessment within such district, or the wife or husband of such holder of title or evidence of title, shall be entitled to vote at such election. Otherwise said election must be held and the results thereof determined and declared in all respects as nearly as practicable in conformity with the provisions of this title governing the election of directors: provided, that no informalities in conducting such an election shall invalidate the same if the election shall have been otherwise fairly conducted. At such election the ballots shall contain the words “bonds—yes” or “bonds—no,” or other words equivalent thereto. If two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast are “bonds—yes” the board of directors shall cause bonds in said amount to be issued; if more than one-third (1/3) of the votes cast at any bond election are “bonds—no” the result of such election shall be so declared and entered of record.
    And whenever thereafter said board in its judgment deems it for the best interest of the district that the question of the issuance of bonds in said amount, or any other amount, shall be submitted to the electors, it shall so declare of record in its minutes, and may thereupon submit such questions to said electors in the same manner and with like effect as at such previous election.

      Whenever the electors shall have authorized an issue of bonds as hereinbefore provided, the board of directors shall examine each tract or legal subdivision of land in said district, and shall determine the benefits which will accrue to each of such tracts or subdivisions from the construction or purchase of such irrigation works; and the cost of such works shall be apportioned or distributed over such tracts or subdivisions of land in proportion to such benefits; and the amount so apportioned or distributed to each of said tracts or subdivisions shall be and remain the basis for fixing the annual assessments levied against such tracts or subdivisions in carrying out the purpose of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such board of directors shall make, or cause to be made, a list of such apportionments or distribution, which list shall contain a complete description of each subdivision or tract of land of such district, with the amount and rate per acre of such apportionment or distribution of cost, and the name of the owner thereof; or they may prepare a map on a convenient scale showing each of said subdivisions or tracts with the rate per acre of such apportionment entered thereon: provided, that where all lands on any map or section of a map are assessed at the same rate, a general statement to that effect shall be sufficient.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said list or map shall be made in duplicate and one (1) copy of each shall be filed in the office of the department of water resources and one (1) copy shall remain in the office of said board of directors for public inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever thereafter any assessment is made either in lieu of bonds, or any annual assessment for raising the interest on bonds, or any portion of the principal, it shall be spread upon the lands in the same proportion as the assessment of benefits, and the whole amount of the assessment of benefits shall equal the amount of bonds or other obligations authorized at the election last above-mentioned.

      If the reconstruction, rehabilitation or replacement of dams, structures or works determined necessary in accordance with section 43-401A, Idaho Code, involves a dam, structure or works which also provide water storage, diversion or delivery of water to water users or water user organizations for the use of said water on lands not within the boundaries of the district proposing the improvements, the district (hereinafter referred to as constructing district) may contract with such water users or water user organizations for payment by them, over a period of time not to exceed the period of any bonded indebtedness incurred by the constructing district to finance construction of the improvements, of a proportionate share of the cost of such improvements, including design, construction, land acquisition and other related costs, to include interest on the unpaid balance of said proportionate share of such water users or water user organization at a rate equal to the average rate of interest payable by the constructing district on any bonded indebtedness incurred by it in financing the improvements.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the water user organization contracting for payment of a proportionate share of the costs of the improvements is an irrigation district (hereinafter referred to as contracting district) organized pursuant to title 43, Idaho Code, the board of directors of such district shall negotiate a proposed contract with the constructing district. Thereafter, the question of entering into the proposed contract shall be submitted to the electors of such contracting district in a manner substantially in conformance with the provisions of section 43-401, Idaho Code. If at least two-thirds (2/3) of the electors approve the execution of the contract, the board shall confirm the proceeding as provided in connection with a bond issue, and following confirmation, the board shall execute the contract and thereafter an annual assessment to provide revenue for payment of the obligation and interest thereon shall be levied and collected on lands within the contracting district in the manner provided for assessment for payment of bonds and interest thereon. The provisions of section 43-404, Idaho Code, shall be applicable to apportionment of benefits accruing under the terms of said contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the water user organization contracting for payment of a proportionate share of the costs of improvements is an operating company entitled to a lien for maintenance charges under chapter 22, title 42, Idaho Code, it shall annually assess and collect the costs of meeting its obligations under the contract as a toll, assessment or charge under chapter 22, title 42, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the water user organization contracting for payment of a proportionate share of the costs of the improvements is a lateral ditch water user association organized and operating under chapter 13, title 42, Idaho Code, the annual cost of meeting the association’s obligation under the contract shall be included in the assessment made under section 42-1303, Idaho Code, and chapter 13, title 42, Idaho Code, shall apply to the collection and disbursement of said assessment.

     <p>
      After the board shall have examined the lands in said district, and before proceeding to make the assessment of benefits and the list and apportionment as provided in the last preceding section, the secretary shall give notice to the owners of said lands that the board will meet at its office on a day to be stated in said notice for the purpose of making such assessment and list and apportionment, and will at such meeting provide a hearing for all parties interested in such proceedings. The secretary shall give such notice by publication in a newspaper published in the county where said office is located in three (3) successive issues if published in a daily newspaper, or by publication in one (1) issue if published in a weekly newspaper, the first of which publications shall be at least fifteen (15) days before the date fixed for said hearing. Additionally, the secretary shall, not less than fifteen (15) days before the date fixed for said hearing, mail notice of the hearing to each owner of such land, if known, or his agent if known, addressed to such person at his post-office address if known, or if unknown, to the post office serving the area wherein his land lies.
     </p>
     <p>
      At such meeting the board shall proceed to hear all parties interested who may appear, and they shall continue in session from day to day until the assessment is completed. They shall hear all evidence offered, including any maps or surveys which any owners of lands may produce, and they may classify the lands in such way that the assessment when completed shall be just and equitable. Any person interested who shall fail to appear before the board shall not be permitted thereafter to contest said assessment or any part thereof except upon a special application to the court in the proceedings for confirmation of said assessment, showing reasonable excuse for failing to appear before said board of directors. In case any landowner makes objection to said assessment or any part thereof before said board, and said objection is overruled by the said board, and the landowner does not consent to the assessment as finally determined, such objection shall, without further proceedings, be regarded as appealed to the district court and to be heard at the said proceedings to confirm as aforesaid.

        Where irrigation district had proceeded in conformity with the statute to issue irrigation district bonds and had procured an adjudication and confirmation of the proceedings and of the assessment of benefits against the several tracts of land within district, the same was res judicata against both landowners and district in all subsequent proceedings insofar as the same may have involved the assessment of benefits against the several tracts of land.

    Judgment of district court which confirmed proceedings of irrigation district in entering into a contract with the United States to supply water to irrigate lands within district, and providing for the joint construction of drainage system, was not res judicata so far as assessment of benefits to lands within district was concerned, and did not preclude statutory proceedings for such assessment.

     </p>
     <p>
      Before making any sale the board shall, by resolution, declare its intention to sell a specified amount of the bonds, and if said bonds can then be sold at their face value and accrued interest, they may be sold without advertisement, otherwise said resolution shall state the day and hour and place of such sale, and shall cause such resolutions to be entered on the minutes, and notice of sale to be given by publication thereof at least four (4) weeks in three (3) newspapers published in the state of Idaho, one (1) of which shall be a newspaper published in the county in which the office of the board of directors is situated, if there be a newspaper published in said county, and in other newspapers at their discretion. Said notice shall state that sealed proposals will be received by the board at their office for the purchase of bonds until the day and hour named in the resolution.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the time appointed the board shall open the proposals and award the purchase of the bonds to the highest responsible bidder, or may reject all bids; but in case no bids are received, or all bids are rejected, at the time stated in the advertisement, it shall not be again necessary to advertise the sale of the same bonds, but they may be sold at any time until canceled: provided, said board shall in no event sell any of the said bonds for less than the par or face value thereof and accrued interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, for any reason, the duly authorized bonds of a district cannot be sold, or if at any time it shall be deemed for the best interests of the district to withdraw from sale all or any portion of an authorized bond issue, the board of directors may, in their discretion, cancel the same and they may levy assessments to the amount of the bonds canceled: provided, that the revenue derived from said assessments must be employed for the same purpose as was contemplated by the bond authorization; but no levy shall be made to pay for work or material, payment for which was contemplated by bonds which have been authorized, until bonds to the amount of said assessment have been canceled. Assessments made in lieu of bonds canceled shall be collected in the manner, and shall have the same force and effect, as assessments levied under any provision of this title: provided, that such assessment shall not, during any one (1) year, exceed ten per cent (10%) of the total bond issue authorized by such district, unless a greater assessment shall be authorized by a majority vote of the qualified electors of the district voting at a general election or a special election called for that purpose, said special election to be held in the manner provided in section 43-321[, Idaho Code].

      Upon the presentation of the coupons due to the treasurer, he shall pay the same from the bond fund. Whenever, after ten (10) years from the issuance of said bonds, said fund shall amount to the sum of $10,000, the board of directors may direct the treasurer to pay such an amount of said bonds not due as the money in said fund will redeem, at the lowest value at which they may be offered for liquidation, after advertising for at least four (4) weeks in some newspaper published in the county, and in other newspapers which said board may deem advisable, for sealed proposals for the redemption of said bonds. Said proposals shall be opened by the board in open meeting, at a time to be named in the notice, and the lowest bids for said bonds must be accepted: provided, that no bond shall be redeemed at a rate above par. In case the bids are equal, the lowest numbered bond shall have the preference. In case none of the holders of said bonds shall desire to have the same redeemed, as herein provided for, said money shall be invested by the treasurer under the direction of the board, in United States bonds or the bonds or warrants of the state, or municipal or school bonds, which shall be kept in said bond fund and may be used to redeem said district bonds whenever the holders thereof may desire.

      § 43-413. Safety fund for payment of bonds and contract obligations.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of directors of any irrigation district organized under the laws of this state, may, when in the opinion of the board it will improve the credit of the district, or the marketability of the district bonds, or tend to reduce the rate of interest necessary to be paid thereon, or in any other way be to the benefit of the district, provide by the adoption of a suitable resolution of the board of directors for inserting in the bonds of the district or the district contract of the United States, an agreement to the effect that a safety fund will be provided to insure the payment of the district’s obligations under the bonds or contract. Said resolution shall provide that the safety fund provided for in this section may be funded through either or both of the following methods:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t43c04s43-413ol1a">
       by making all annual levies for payment of the principal or interest of such bonds or the obligation of such contract (until a safety fund of at least ten per cent (10%) of the unpaid bonded indebtedness or contract indebtedness of the district has been created), fifteen per cent (15%) in excess of the amount which would be required to meet such obligations if all district taxes were paid without delinquency,
      </li>
      <li id="t43c04s43-413ol1b">
       by depositing in said safety fund from the proceeds of sale of such bonds an amount equal to at least ten per cent (10%) of the original principal amount of the issue of bonds.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Said safety fund shall be used to meet any deficiency which might otherwise occur in the payment of the principal and interest of said bonds or contract obligations as set forth in the resolution providing for the safety fund and said safety fund shall be kept intact by initiating or renewing such fifteen per cent (15%) excess levies whenever such safety fund is reduced below ten per cent (10%) of the unpaid bonded indebtedness or United States contract indebtedness of the district and continuing the same until such safety fund is again brought up to at least ten per cent (10%) of such unpaid bond or contract indebtedness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever such agreement shall have been inserted in the bonds or contract of any irrigation district, all levies thereafter made in such district shall be made in full compliance with such agreement until such bonds or contracts have been fully paid.

      § 43-414. Interim notes.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the permanent financing contemplated in this chapter, the board of any district may borrow money and issue interim notes in evidence thereof whenever it is deemed advisable and in the interests of the district to borrow funds temporarily for any of the purposes herein provided in advance of permanent financing. No election shall be required on the issuance of interim notes. The board may, from time to time and pursuant to appropriate resolution, borrow money and issue interim notes to evidence borrowing for the purpose of obtaining funds for any of the purposes authorized in this chapter. Any resolution authorizing the issuance of interim notes shall describe generally the purpose for which such notes are to be issued and shall specify the principal amount, rate of interest and maturity date, which shall be the same for all interim notes and which shall be not to exceed five (5) years from the date of issue of such notes, and such other pertinent terms as may be specified in such resolution. The interim notes shall be issued from time to time by the board as funds are borrowed in the manner the board may determine. Interest on the interim notes may be made payable semiannually, annually or at maturity. The interim notes may be made redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the board in the manner and upon the terms fixed by the resolution authorizing their issuance. Such interim notes shall be sold at such price or prices as may be determined by resolution of the board. All such interim notes and the interest thereon may be secured by a pledge of the proceeds of assessments to be levied and collected by the board pursuant to the provisions of section 43-404, Idaho Code, representing the amount of benefits which will accrue to each tract or legal subdivision of land in the district based upon the allocation of the cost of the project for which permanent financing has been authorized to each such tract or legal subdivision of land, but only when there shall have been held, in said district, an election on the right of the district to issue bonds for said project, which bonds shall have been approved at said election, and which election shall have been called, held and conducted in the manner now or hereafter provided in this chapter. Said interim notes and the interest thereon shall be payable solely from such assessments and from the proceeds to be derived from the sale of any bonds for permanent financing authorized to be issued pursuant to this chapter, provided, however, that none of the provisions of this title requiring the filing of a petition for confirmation of proceedings taken in connection with a bond issue of any district shall apply to interim notes of said district. Contemporaneously, with the issuance of the bonds as provided by this chapter, all interim notes, even though they may not have then matured, shall be paid, both principal and interest and applicable premium, if any, to date of payment, from the funds derived from the sale of bonds authorized hereunder for the permanent financing, and such interim notes shall thereupon be surrendered and canceled.

        Before the board of directors of any such irrigation district shall cause to be issued and sold any of the coupon bonds of said district mentioned in the preceding section, they shall first call a special election and there shall be submitted to the qualified electors of said district who are residents of the district, the holders of title or evidence of title to lands in said district, the question of whether or not the bonds in said district in the amount determined and set forth in the resolution of the board of directors of the district shall be authorized to be issued for said purpose.

       <p>
        Notice of such election must be given by posting notice in three (3) public places in each election precinct in said district at least four (4) weeks before the date of said election, and the publication thereof for the same length of time in some newspaper published in the district, and in case no paper is published in the district, then in a paper published in each of the counties in which the district or any part thereof is located. Such notice must specify the time for holding said election, the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the purposes for which the same are to be issued. Said election must be held and the results thereof determined and declared in all respects, as nearly as practicable, in conformity with the provisions of chapter 4 of this title, governing bond elections: provided, that no informality in conducting such election shall invalidate the same if the election shall have been otherwise correctly conducted. At such election the ballots shall contain the words “Bonds — yes” and “Bonds — no,” or other words equivalent thereto.

     <p>
      The board of directors of any irrigation district organized under the laws of the state of Idaho may issue negotiable coupon bonds, to be denominated refunding bonds, for the purpose of refunding any of the bonded indebtedness of the district, whether due or not due, or which has or may hereafter become payable at the option of the district or by consent of the bondholders, or by any lawful means, whether such bonded indebtedness be now existing or may hereafter be created, and there shall not be funds in the treasury of such district available for the payment or redemption of such bonds and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon; but the amount of such refunding bonds to be issued under the provisions of this chapter shall first be determined by such directors, and a certificate of such determination shall be made and entered in and upon the records of said district prior to the issuance of said refunding bonds.

       <p>
        Whenever the board of directors shall deem it expedient to issue refunding bonds under the provisions of this chapter, they shall, by resolution duly adopted and made a part of the district records, call a special election of the qualified voters of the district, for the purpose of voting upon the question of authorizing the board of directors of the district to issue such refunding bonds, or the question may be submitted at a general election for district directors.
       </p>
       <p>
        At any election held under the provisions of this chapter the question of authorizing the refunding of all or any part of the then outstanding bonded indebtedness of the district, including accrued and unpaid interest, may be submitted as one (1) question for determination whether such bonds are of the same or of different issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        The notice of said election shall be published and posted for the same length of time and in the same manner, and the election shall be conducted and the result thereof determined and declared in all respects, as nearly as may be, in conformity with the provisions of the irrigation district laws of Idaho governing elections authorizing original bond issues. Said election notice shall specify the time and place for holding said election, the amount and date of the bonds to be refunded, the amount of refunding bonds proposed to be issued, the rate of interest they shall bear, and the time or times when the debt evidenced by such refunding bonds shall be paid: provided, that the said time or times shall not extend beyond a period of forty (40) years from the date of said refunding bonds: provided further, that provision may be made, if deemed expedient by the board of directors, for the payment of the principal, with interest, in suitable installments throughout the term of the loan evidenced by said refunding bonds.
       </p>
       <p>
        At such election the ballots shall contain the words “Refunding bonds—yes” and the words “Refunding bonds—no,” and the voter shall answer the question submitted by marking a cross (X) opposite the words expressing his choice.

      If upon canvassing the vote cast at any election held under the provisions of this chapter it shall be determined by the board of directors that a majority of the legal votes cast upon the question submitted are in favor of refunding, the board of directors shall make such determination a part of the official records of the district, and shall immediately thereafter adopt and make a part of the records of said district a resolution providing for the issue of said refunding bonds in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Such resolution may provide that the refunding bonds so authorized will be issued in one or more series, shall designate the denomination or denominations thereof, fix the date or dates of said refunding bonds, the rate or rates of interest, the maturity date or dates, the place or places, within or without the state of Idaho, for payment of both principal and interest and shall prescribe the form of said refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds shall be negotiable in form, shall recite the title of the act under which they are issued, shall be executed in the name of the district and signed by the president, with the seal of the district affixed thereto, and attested by the secretary. The interest accruing on such refunding bonds shall be evidenced by interest coupons thereto attached, bearing the engraved facsimile signature of the treasurer of the district and when so executed such coupons shall be the binding obligations of the district according to their import. In the adoption of said resolution providing for the issue of such refunding bonds, the directors may, in their discretion, within the limits of the authority granted by the voters at the refunding bond election, make the principal of the debt or of each instalment of the debt, as the case may be, payable in certain specified sums, at certain specified times during the currency of the period (not exceeding forty (40) years) within which the debt or each instalment of the debt, as the case may be, is to be discharged: provided, that the first instalment of the debt evidenced by said refunding bonds shall be payable not more than ten (10) years from the date of said refunding bonds, and the instalments thereafter shall be of such amounts that the total thereof shall equal the aggregate principal indebtedness; and the directors may issue the refunding bonds of the district for the amounts and payable at the times corresponding with such specified sums, together with interest, payable semiannually, as may be set forth and provided by such resolution.

      § 43-610. Refunding bonds — Issuance upon resolution of board.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the board of directors of an irrigation district deems it for the best interests of the district to issue refunding bonds under this chapter without holding an election, a resolution may be adopted by the unanimous vote of the board of directors and made a part of the records of said district, dispensing with the calling and holding of an election as provided by this chapter. Such resolution shall specify the amount, date and maturities and amount of interest due on the bonds to be refunded, the amount and date of the refunding bonds proposed to be issued, whether the same will comprise one or more issues, the denomination or denominations thereof, the rate of interest they shall bear, which shall not exceed the rate of interest provided for in the bonds to be refunded, the place or places within or without the state of Idaho for payment of both principal and interest thereon, and the time or times when the debt evidenced by such refunding bonds shall be paid and such resolution shall prescribe the form of said refunding bonds; provided, that the said time or times of payment shall not extend beyond a date forty (40) years from the date of such issue of such refunding bonds; and provided further, that provisions shall be made by the board of directors for the payment of the principal of such refunding bonds in suitable annual or semi-annual installments commencing such number of years after the date of the bonds as the board of directors may deem best suited to the needs of the district, with semi-annual interest payments throughout the term such bonds shall run, conforming as nearly as may be practicable to the amortization plan, so called, so that the combined payments of principal and interest shall be approximately the same each year in which any of the refunding bonds authorized by said resolution mature. All of the provisions of this chapter, except as herein otherwise specifically provided, shall apply to refunding bonds issued under the provisions of this section.

       The secretary of the board of directors shall be the assessor of the district, and on or before August 1 of each year shall prepare an assessment book containing a full and accurate list and description of all of the land of the district, and a list of the persons who own, claim or have in possession or control thereof during said year, giving the number of acres listed to each person: provided, that where the property to be listed is described by metes and bounds description, the assessor of the district may give to each tract of land within the district which is described by metes and bounds description an irrigation district assessment number, which number shall be placed on the assessment roll to indicate the certain piece of land bearing such number, and entered on a plat book to indicate what tract is designated by such irrigation district assessment number, and no further description of such land shall be necessary upon the irrigation district assessment roll. The assessor of the district must, in the event irrigation district assessment numbers are used in lieu of the metes and bounds description, on or before the first day of August of each year, file with the board of directors of the district an accurate and complete list of all irrigation district assessment numbers entered on the assessment rolls for the year, showing opposite each number an accurate description of the tract of land designated by such number. Thereafter, in all cases where an irrigation district assessment number is used to designate the same tract of land in the assessment of succeeding year, the assessor of the district shall not include such number in his list of the irrigation district assessment numbers filed with the board of directors of the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c07s43-701ol12">
       Whenever a tract of land which has been given an irrigation district assessment number is subdivided, the assessor of the district shall give each subdivision a new irrigation district assessment number, which number with an accurate description of the tract of land designated by such new number, shall be included in his list of irrigation district assessment numbers filed with the board of directors; provided, that the owners of two (2) or more lots each of which is less than five (5) acres in size in any subdivision which has been given new assessment numbers may request of the assessor in writing that those lots be combined for assessment purposes, whereupon the assessor shall combine those lots into a single assessment number, which may be the same as the number previously assigned to one (1) of the lots, which number with an accurate description of the lots designated by such number shall be included in his list of irrigation district assessment numbers filed with the board of directors; thereafter, such combined area shall be deemed to be a single parcel for all purposes related to the levy and collection of assessments and all subsequent assessments shall constitute a single lien against the entire combined area. The request to combine the parcels for assessment purposes shall include the name and mailing address of the person designated by the requesting landowners to receive notices from the district. All assessment notices which otherwise would be sent to the individual landowners, shall be sent to the person thus designated, and shall be deemed to have been sent to the owner of each parcel included in the combined area.
    (3) In all irrigation districts where the collection of assessments is made by county officers as provided for by sections 43-727, 43-728 and 43-729, Idaho Code, said assessment book shall be prepared on or before June fifteenth of each year and the provisions of this section with reference to assessment numbers shall not apply. If the name of the person owning, claiming, possessing or controlling any tract of said land is not known, it shall be listed to unknown owners.

     <p>
      In all districts in which an assessment is levied for the purpose of maintaining and operating the works of said district, at a regular meeting of the board between August 1 and November 8 of each year, the board of directors shall levy an assessment upon all the lands of the district for the expense of maintaining and operating the property of the district; provided, that in all districts where the collection of assessments is made by county officers as provided by sections 43-727, 43-729, Idaho Code, said levy shall be made on or before the third Tuesday of July of each year.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) At the time of meeting of the board of directors to levy assessments as in this section provided, the board of directors of the irrigation district are authorized to determine the aggregate amount necessary to be raised for all purposes connected with the maintaining and operating of the works of said district, and may determine the total amount of said sum necessary and required to pay the expense of making the assessment book and extension of the assessments thereon, giving notice of assessments and making collections of assessments, which shall be designated as assessment expense fund. If the district has adopted a flat rate method of assessing residential lots of one (1) acre or less as authorized by section 43-701B, Idaho Code, the share of the assessment expense to be apportioned against the residential lots and the share to be apportioned against the tracts of land assessed by the regular method shall be determined separately so as to allocate as accurately as reasonably possible, between (1) such residential lots and (2) all other parcels, the assessment expenses specified above. The balance of said amount necessary to be raised shall be designated as operation and maintenance fund. The board of directors are authorized to apportion the total amount of assessment expense fund against the several tracts of land as shown on the assessment book, so that each tract shall pay its proportionate share of the cost of making assessments and collections thereof. The amount of said assessment designated operation and maintenance fund shall be spread upon all the lands in the district and shall be proportionate to the benefits received by such lands growing out of the maintenance and operation of the said works of said district. Such assessments shall be carried out by the secretary and entered into an appropriate column on the assessment roll immediately and shall be subject to review by the board of correction hereinafter provided for.

       (5) In districts that furnish water to landowners who have previously petitioned out of such district, the board of directors shall assess such owners in the same proportionate amount for maintenance and operation of the irrigation works of the district as they do on the land within such district, and in addition thereto shall assess such landowners in the same proportionate amount for bond interest and redemption of bonds outstanding under the provisions of chapters 4, 5, and 6, of this title, or other contract indebtedness of the district, as they do against the land of the district, and such assessment shall be considered as a toll, and if not paid by the first day of January following such assessment, the board of directors may refuse to deliver water to such landowner until this, or any other delinquent payment has been paid.

        During the course of the construction of an irrigation system, it would be unjust to exact payment for maintenance and operation, because tracts of land to which water has not been made available should not be assessed for that purpose.

        Benefits cannot be ignored in assessing for maintenance, but almost invariably benefits derived from maintenance are substantially equal, and therefore a flat assessment per acre is justifiable. Nampa & Meridian Irrigation Dist. v. Petrie, 37 Idaho 45, 223 P. 531 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the intention of the legislature, under this section, that the irrigable lands within the district should be considered as a whole and must be assessed for maintenance and operation of the water system at the same rate where the benefits, that is the water needed and received, are the same.

        It could not have been the legislative intention to create two methods of raising money for maintenance and operation of a completed irrigation system, one by assessment which must be uniform according to its benefits, and the other by tolls which need not be uniform or based upon benefits, but may be based upon costs of delivery.

      § 43-701A. Rehabilitation of irrigation works — Levy for preliminary study costs.
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the rehabilitation, reconstruction or replacement of irrigation works is determined necessary by the board of directors and a bond issue authorized by section 43-401A, Idaho Code, or other financing arrangement will be required for the project, the board of a district constructing the works or a district which will pay a proportionate share of the cost of the project may include in its assessment levy under section 43-701, Idaho Code, an amount sufficient to obtain surveys, examinations, plans and professional services necessary to determine the cost or feasibility of the project, or obtain its authorization. If other water user organizations contract with the constructing district for payment of a share of the costs of the project, sums expended by the constructing district or others as herein authorized may be included in total project cost; provided that if the monies so assessed and expended by the constructing district or other participating district are repaid, the district may (i) use the money to meet and offset future expenses or assessments of the district, and/or (ii) refund part or all of said money as an adjustment to the original assessment to the present landowners of the district in proportion to the previous assessments from which said money was obtained; provided further that in the event a district is a nonoperating entity, said district may refund part or all as above provided to the irrigation entities that comprise said district in proportion to the previous assessments to landowners within such irrigation entities levied against the lands of said irrigation entities.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of section 43-701, Idaho Code, whenever the cost of making and collecting assessments against residential tracts, one (1) acre or less in size, is determined by the board of directors to be burdensome on the district and on the owners of such lots, the board may assess all such tracts at a flat rate, to be determined by dividing the total amount assessable against all such tracts by the total number of such tracts, and the flat rate assessments thus determined may be certified to the county officers as specified in section 43-701C, Idaho Code, for collection or may be collected by the district in substantially the same manner that other assessments are collected pursuant to this chapter. The board, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, may establish the maximum lot size for flat rate assessments at any size within the range between one-fourth (¼) acre and one (1) acre. Tracts included or retained in an irrigation district for drainage purposes only shall be assessed only for drainage costs and may be certified to the county officers on a separate list. The board may, in its discretion, exclude from the flat rate assessment procedure any tracts upon which liens for construction costs exist under the provisions of sections 43-328 through and including 43-330, Idaho Code.

      § 43-701C. Flat rate assessments — Preparation and certification of lists — Changes in legal descriptions.
     </h3>
     <p>
      As soon as possible after the board of directors determines to make flat rate assessments as provided in section 43-701B, Idaho Code, the treasurer of the district shall prepare a list containing the legal description, the assessor’s parcel number and the name and last known address of the owner of record of each residential tract, one (1) acre or less in size, assessed by the district for all purposes, and a separate list in like manner for such tracts assessed only for drainage. The list or lists may be certified by the treasurer to the county auditor of the county in which the lands are situate. When an irrigation district includes lands in more than one (1) county, separate lists may be prepared for each county. When a tract lies partly in one (1) county and partly in one or more other counties, only the portion in any county shall be included in the list for that county if the treasurer is certifying a list or lists to the county auditor. If the legal description of any tract or tracts on any such list differs from the legal description as shown by the assessor’s records, the auditor shall notify the irrigation district treasurer of the discrepancy and the description in the list shall be changed by the irrigation district treasurer, by an addendum, to conform with the assessor’s records; provided, however, that where the discrepancy between the descriptions occurs because a portion of the parcel lies outside the boundaries of the irrigation district, no change in description shall be required, and the irrigation district assessments shall be effective only as to the portions of any such parcel that are within the boundaries of the irrigation district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      At a regular meeting between August 1 and November 8 of each year the board of directors shall levy an assessment upon the lands in said district upon the basis, and in the proportion, of the list and apportionment of benefits approved by the court as hereinbefore provided, which assessment shall be sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the outstanding bonds of the district as the same fall due. The secretary of the board must compute and enter in a separate column of the assessment book the respective sums, in dollars and cents, to be paid as an assessment on the property therein enumerated. When collected, the assessment shall be paid into the district treasury and shall constitute a special fund to be called “Bond fund of . . . . irrigation district.”
     </p>

      In case any assessment should be made for the purpose contemplated by a bond authorization, it shall be entered in a separate column of the assessment book in the same manner as the bond fund; and when collected shall constitute the “Construction fund of . . . . irrigation district.”

      Except in districts which have prior to such assessment entered into contracts with the United States requiring payments to the United States on or before December first of that year, on or before the first day of November the secretary must deliver the assessment book to the treasurer of the district, who shall within ten (10) days publish a notice in a newspaper published in each county in which any portion of the district may lie, that said assessments are due and payable and will become delinquent if not postmarked by or received by five o’clock p.m. on the twentieth day of December next thereafter, and also the times and places at which the payment of the assessments may be made, which notice shall be published for the period of two (2) weeks. If the twentieth day of December falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the assessment postmark or receipt deadline shall be the following Monday. The treasurer must attend at the times and places specified in the notice to receive assessments, which must be paid in lawful money of the United States: provided, that maintenance warrants of the district may be accepted as cash in the hands of the original owner for the payment of the maintenance assessments; and that matured bonds of the district and the accrued interest coupons detached from any of the bonds of the district, when presented by landowners within the irrigation district, may be accepted as cash in payment of assessments levied for bond interest and principal, and in the event that the said bonds so used are of a greater denomination than the said assessments the treasurer shall indorse upon said bond or bonds the amount necessary to pay said assessment or assessments and the date of said payment, and take a receipt from such bond holder for the amount so credited, and either such receipt describing the bond so indorsed or such indorsement shall be prima facie evidence that the said sum so indorsed has been paid on said bond or bonds. He must mark the date of payment of any assessment in the assessment book opposite the name of the person paying and give a receipt to such person, specifying the amount of the assessment and the amount paid with a description of the property assessed. Unpaid assessments for the current year are delinquent if not postmarked by or received by five o’clock p.m. on the twentieth day of December or the following Monday should the twentieth day of December fall on a Saturday or Sunday; provided, that if any person pays one-half (½) of his assessment before it becomes delinquent as aforesaid, the remaining one-half (½) shall not become delinquent until the twentieth day of June at five o’clock p.m. of each year if not received or postmarked by the same, or the following Monday should the twentieth day of June fall on a Saturday or Sunday.

        Although a personal representative of a potential purchaser was the only person to receive written notice of the pending issuance of a tax deed, he was neither the record owner nor a party in interest, and, thus, the irrigation district did not comply with the statutory requirements, because it failed to serve proper notice. The tax deed was void ab initio, and the district did not have the authority to transfer the deed to the purchasers, who had no claim on the property. Salladay v.

Whereupon, the treasurer shall note such assignment opposite the entry on his list of delinquency entries and in case of subsequent redemption thereof, he shall pay the amount so received in redemption to the assignee upon surrender of the tax certificate reassigned to the district; provided, however, that no assignment shall be made unless all prior assessments against the lands covered by such delinquency entry be first fully paid.

        Although a personal representative of a potential purchaser was the only person to receive written notice of the pending issuance of a tax deed, he was neither the record owner nor a party in interest, and, thus, the irrigation district did not comply with the statutory requirements, because it failed to serve proper notice. The tax deed was void ab initio, and the district did not have the authority to transfer the deed to the purchasers, who had no claim on the property. Salladay v. Bowen, 161 Idaho 563, 388 P.3d 577 (2017).

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2016, ch. 273 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify the scope and effect of Idaho’s statutes governing tax deeds. In the case of
    Regan v. Owen
    , the Idaho Supreme Court addressed whether a tax deed issued pursuant to Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, has the effect of extinguishing an otherwise valid private easement across the subject property. Similar legislative language exists with respect to counties in Section 31-808, Idaho Code, with respect to irrigation entities in Section 43-720, Idaho Code, and with respect to cities in Section 50-1823, Idaho Code. The court did not decide the issue, but remanded to a lower court. The lower court subsequently ruled that, despite the harsh result, the statute has this effect. While a private access easement was at issue there, the reasoning would also result in the elimination of public utility easements, ditch rights, public highways and rights-of-way, conservation easements, and all manner of third-party rights in the land including, for example, interests of remaindermen following a life estate. By this legislation, the Idaho Legislature rejects that conclusion. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow local governments to destroy valid property interests held by third parties in land that is subject to a sale or other conveyance based on a tax delinquency, except where notice and opportunity to cure is provided under the statute. Doing so would constitute an uncompensated taking of property under both the Idaho Constitution and the United States Constitution. The Legislature would never have intended such a result and, by this legislation, makes that clear. As its context should have made evident, the purpose of Section 63-1009, Idaho Code, and the other referenced sections, has always been to convey title absolutely free and clear of liens and mortgages of a monetary nature. It was never the intent of the Legislature to allow a local governmental entity to convey more than the delinquent taxpayer owned and thereby to destroy valid property interests held by others without notice and an opportunity to cure. This clarification brings the interpretation of Idaho’s tax deed statute into line with the interpretation of similar statutes in other jurisdictions, as had always been the Legislature’s intent.”

        The sections of the Compiled Statutes of Idaho above referred to, and continued in effect for the purpose of proceedings under any assessments levied prior to the year 1925, are surely obsolete after the lapse of so many years. Consequently, this section as set out above is now probably obsolete.

     <p>
      The board of directors of any irrigation district organized under the laws of this state desiring to provide for the collection of district assessments by the county officers instead of the district treasurer, may do so by adopting a resolution providing for such collection by the county officers, and furnishing a copy thereof to the county auditor of each county in which any of the district lands are located:[;] provided, that the county commissioners of said county or counties, must first by unanimous vote concur in and agree to such resolution by a proper resolution made and entered upon the minutes of such board or boards of county commissioners. Such resolution may provide that only assessments against lands subdivided into tracts of four (4) acres or less shall be collected by the county officers. In addition to collection fees otherwise provided by law, the county commissioners may levy an additional fee against the irrigation district for the cost of transferring records and initiating the collection process. After the adoption of such resolution the board of directors of such district shall furnish the county auditor of each county in which any part of the district lands are located a duplicate or certified copy of any apportionment of benefits which has been made, and copy of the list or map showing said apportionment theretofore made in such district, and a notice of any district bond issue or district contract with the United States, stating clearly the amount thereof, the rate of interest, and the conditions of payment, and each year thereafter shall furnish the said auditor or auditors a certified copy, or duplicate, of any additional apportionment, including any annual apportionment for operation and maintenance purposes, and shall each year furnish such auditor or auditors a certified copy, or duplicate of the levy or assessment made by the order of said board of directors for operation and maintenance purposes, including organization expenses and maintenance of the district organization. All tracts benefited to the same extent, on a proportionate basis, by the water rights and irrigation system of the district, and by the operation and maintenance thereof, shall be included in a separate category plainly identified in the list showing said apportionment of benefits. After the receipt of said copy of such resolution of the board of directors of any irrigation district, the county auditor shall each year enter upon the county assessment roll against the property therein described the levy so made by the board of directors of said district as shown upon the copy or duplicate thereof furnished to the said auditor as above provided, in manner similar to that in which other municipal school or road district assessments are entered by him on said assessment roll, except that the sum assessed and charged against each description of land therein contained for such irrigation district purposes shall be entered by the auditor as the operation and maintenance assessment of the . . . . irrigation district against the same. Such district operation and maintenance tax shall be collected and accounted for by the county officers in the same manner as other municipal taxes and paid over to the district treasurer together with any penalties or interest collected thereon, and the collection thereof shall be enforced in the same manner, and neglect to pay the same shall be subject to the same penalties as the other taxes of the county:[;] provided, however, that the collection of such district assessments by such county officers, as herein provided, shall not make the bonds, contracts and interests due from such irrigation districts the obligation of such county or counties.

The county auditor of each county in which such district lands are located shall each year enter upon the county assessment roll against the property therein described the levy so made by the board of county commissioners, in manner similar to that in which school or other municipal or road district assessments are entered by him on said assessment roll, except that the sum assessed and charged against each description of land therein contained for such irrigation district purposes shall be entered by the auditor as the bond or contract assessment of the . . . . irrigation district against the same. Such district bond or contract tax shall be collected and accounted for by the county officers in the same manner as other municipal taxes and the collection thereof shall be enforced in the same manner, and neglect to pay the same shall be subject to the same penalties as the other taxes of the county and the same shall be paid over to the state treasurer who shall act as treasurer of the district for the purpose of receiving and depositing such funds and disbursing the same in payment of the district’s bond and United States contract obligations and the interest thereon.

      The cost and expense of purchasing and acquiring property and constructing works and improvements to carry out the formulated plan, shall be paid out of the construction fund.

     <p>
      For the purpose of defraying the expenses of the organization of the district, and of the care, operation, management, repair and improvement of such portion of said canal and works as are completed and in use, including salaries of officers and employees, the board may fix rates of tolls and charges for use of water from the canals and irrigation works and plants or equipment of the district, and in addition thereto may provide for the payment of such expenses, either in whole or in part, by levy of assessments therefor, as provided in section 43-701[, Idaho Code]. Where a toll is fixed for the payment of part of such expenditures and an assessment levied for the remainder, any portion of such toll, remaining unpaid at the time fixed for levying the next annual assessment, in the discretion of the board may be added to and become part of the assessment against the land delinquent in the payment of such toll; and where both a toll is fixed and assessment levied for the same expenditures, the amount paid as toll may be applied as credit upon such assessment. The board in its order fixing or levying such tolls may fix the date or dates on or before which the same must be paid, may make the same payable in advance of the delivery of any water during the year for which the same are fixed, and may make provision for the collection thereof and the keeping of a toll book by the district treasurer. The procedure for levying and collection of assessments, where not provided for in sections 43-701 and 43-703[, Idaho Code], shall conform to the provisions of this title relating to the payment of principal and interest of bonds. All assessments shall be listed and carried out in the regular assessment book and collected by the treasurer at the time and in the manner of the regular annual assessment. All special assessments are a lien on the lands assessed from the time when they are ordered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever an assessment book or toll book shall be delivered to the treasurer, the secretary shall charge the treasurer with the total amount of the various amounts as carried out in said books. On the second Monday of January in each year, the treasurer shall make a semiannual statement with the secretary and deliver to the secretary a statement in brief of all assessments delinquent at that time, and account for all sums therefor collected. The treasurer shall make such settlements for tolls at such times as may be ordered by the board. On the second Monday of July the treasurer shall make final settlement with the secretary and deliver to the secretary a duplicate delinquent list and account for all sums not shown on said delinquent list. The secretary shall then charge the treasurer with the amount of said list and penalties added, and upon receiving the affidavit of publication thereof, he shall charge the treasurer with twenty-five cents (25¢) additional for each description published. On the first Monday after the sale, the treasurer shall make final settlement for assessments by receiving credit for the property sold to the district and accounting for all the balance.

      If within ninety (90) days of board approval of an order allowing annexation a petition signed by either ten (10) landowners or by two percent (2%) of the landowners, whichever number is greater, of the district is presented to the board which petition states that those signing request an election to approve or disapprove said annexation, then the board shall order an election be held within said district to determine whether the boundaries of the district shall be changed as mentioned in said order; and shall fix the time at which such election shall be held. Notice thereof shall be given and published, and such election shall be held, and all things pertaining thereto conducted, in the manner prescribed by this title in case of an election to determine whether bonds of the district shall be issued. The ballots cast at said election shall contain the words “For change of boundary,” or “Against change of boundary,” or words equivalent thereto. The notice of election shall describe the lands to be annexed to said district.

      If at such election a majority of all the votes cast at said election shall be against such change of the boundaries of the district, the board shall rescind its order and it shall be of no force or effect.

        It is the apparent purpose of the provisions of this section to make the landowners within an irrigation district equal (except as to any disparity which may be found to exist in benefits received) so far as may be consistent with priority of water rights as recognized and protected by the provisions of the constitution.

       <p>
        The court recognizes the right acquired by the owners of new lands, by their inclusion within the district, to the use of any water owned by the district when the use thereof was not required for the proper irrigation of the old lands and when such use was not in conflict with the rights previously acquired by the owners of the old lands.

       <p>
        The owners of the old lands, through and by means of the irrigation district, acquired, and for many years applied to the irrigation of their lands, valuable water rights which had become appurtenant and dedicated to their lands and which were held in trust by the district for their use: they could not thereafter, without their consent, be deprived of the use of that water when needed to irrigate their lands.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person or persons owning land within any irrigation district and forming a part thereof may file with the board of directors of such irrigation district a petition in writing requesting the exclusion of the land or lands owned by them and described in the petition from the irrigation district. As many parties owning separate tracts or parcels of lands in any irrigation district or who are united in interest to which the same state of facts apply, may unite in the same petition. The petition shall be signed by all of the petitioners, but need not be acknowledged. A filing fee in the amount of five dollars ($5.00) for each parcel of land described in the petition shall accompany the filing of each petition, plus an exclusion fee in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each lot containing less than one (1) acre which is in a subdivision as defined in section 50-1301, Idaho Code, or an exclusion fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each parcel containing less than one (1) acre that is not in a subdivision, or an exclusion fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each acre and additional portion thereof in all other parcels of property, for which the district shall provide a suitable receipt evidencing payment. Any petition not accompanied by the required filing fee and exclusion fee shall be returned to the petitioner. The filing fee and the exclusion fee are borne by the petitioner and are not potentially apportionable costs as provided in sections 43-1105, 43-1106 and 43-1107, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person or persons purchasing land under a written contract shall be deemed to be the owners of that land for purposes of this section.

        If land which cannot derive a benefit from an irrigation district was included therein, under this section such land may be excluded. Nielson v. Board of Directors, 63 Idaho 108, 117 P.2d 472 (1931).

        The owners of land that was used only as a gravel pit and that could not be supplied with water by the irrigation district because of the construction of an interstate highway across the land were entitled to have it excluded from the irrigation district. Lodge v. Miller, 91 Idaho 662, 429 P.2d 394 (1967).

        In action to exclude property from irrigation district, evidence that property in question had never used water from irrigation district, that irrigation district delivered sufficient water to municipal irrigation system to satisfy any irrigation needs of the property and that some system could be constructed at the expense of the property owner to deliver water to the property from its present terminus some 250 feet away and if such water were delivered it would not confer a benefit on the property but would result in a flooding problem, was sustained by trial court’s finding that the property was not served by irrigation district. Pioneer Irrigation Dist. v. College Park Assocs., 104 Idaho 830, 663 P.2d 1132 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under paragraph 3 of subsection (a) of this section in order to exclude property from an irrigation district it must be shown that the property sought to be excluded is “served” by an irrigation entity before the question of injury to the irrigation entity becomes relevant.

        The statutory term “served” as used in paragraph 3 of subsection (a) of this section need not be equated with the term “benefited” as used in the case that dealt with inclusion of land within irrigation district and which was decided before the enactment of this section.

      The board of directors of the irrigation district may conduct its own investigation of the facts alleged in the petition and, by resolution duly adopted, which may address the allegations of several petitions, accept the facts as alleged and determine that no hearing is required prior to granting the petition or petitions for exclusion. If the allegations are not thus accepted such petition must be heard by the board of directors of such irrigation district within one hundred fifty (150) days of filing of the petition. If no hearing is held within one hundred fifty (150) days, the land described in the petition is excluded from the district. If a hearing is ordered, the petitioner or petitioners must establish by competent evidence the allegations of the petition, and the chairman or presiding member of the board is hereby empowered to administer oaths for the purpose of the hearing.

     <p>
      When (1) the board of directors accepts the facts as alleged without a hearing, or (2) the allegations of the petition are established at a hearing, or (3) the land has been excluded by reason of the board’s failure to hold a hearing within one hundred fifty (150) days of filing of the petition, the board must make an order forthwith changing the boundaries of such district so as to exclude the lands described in the petition which the proof has established to be entitled to exclusion, and thereafter the lands so excluded shall not form a part of the irrigation district for any purpose except as provided in subsection (b) of section 43-1102, Idaho Code; provided however, that the lands so ordered excluded shall not be relieved of their obligation to pay their proportionate share of any existing bonded or contract indebtedness of the irrigation district, and the lands shall remain a part of the irrigation district for the purpose of discharging the existing bonded or contract indebtedness.

      No hearing shall be held when, prior to the date set for the hearing, the board issues an order excluding the land described in the petition from the district.

     <p>
      When land is excluded from the district pursuant to a petition filed on or before December 1 in any calendar year, assessments against the land for any calendar year subsequent to the year in which the petition was filed shall not be valid and no lien for any such attempted assessment shall attach under section 43-706, Idaho Code. Petitioners are, however, required to pay any outstanding assessments levied the calendar year and prior in which the petition is filed and said lien shall attach until said assessments are paid.

      § 43-1105. Survey of land to be excluded.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of directors may cause any survey to be made it deems necessary for the purpose of determining the change in the district by reason of an exclusion or proposed exclusion. In any case where the land is excluded on the ground that it is too high to receive any benefit from the irrigation works of said district without pumping by the landowner, the cost of all surveys shall be borne by the irrigation district. The board may not, however, require a survey when the land sought to be excluded lies entirely within a subdivision as defined in section 50-1301, Idaho Code. If the land described in the petition is described in accordance with the public survey or in accordance with a plat approved, filed and recorded as provided by law, the cost of survey shall be borne by the district.

If the petitioner is required to pay the costs of exclusion hearing proceedings, the board may require a deposit of the estimated costs before they will hear the petition and the one hundred fifty (150) day period in which the petition must be heard as provided in section 43-1104, Idaho Code, shall not begin to run until the estimated costs have been deposited; provided however, that, in case of a successful appeal by the petitioner, the costs taxed by the district to the petitioner or petitioners whose lands are excluded by the district court shall be borne by the irrigation district. If the actual costs of the exclusion proceedings are less than the amount deposited by the petitioner, the excess deposit shall be credited against any amounts which are to be paid by the petitioner prior to entry of the order of exclusion, and the balance, if any, shall be refunded to the petitioner within fourteen (14) days after the hearing; if the actual costs of the exclusion proceedings are more than the deposit, the difference shall be paid to the district by the petitioner within fourteen (14) days after receipt of a statement to that effect from the district, and the board shall not be required to enter an order of exclusion until the difference is paid.

Lots or parcels of land in contiguous subdivisions may be included in the same resolution. Platted lots which theretofore received water through the same ditch operated by a lateral ditch water users’ association may be included in the same resolution. If the board is petitioned by over fifty per cent (50%) of the lot owners of a subdivision, the board shall conduct the entire proceedings according to sections 43-1110 through 43-1117, Idaho Code.

Upon receipt of such a request the board of directors of the irrigation district, in its discretion, may enter an order declaring that the lands are reinstated to their former status, including the water rights, and directing the assessor of the irrigation district to enter the lands on the assessment roll. A copy of the order or resolution of reinstatement, certified by the president and secretary of the district, shall be filed for record in the office of the county recorder of each county wherein any portion of the reinstated land is situated.

     <p>
      Whenever twenty-five (25) or a majority of the landowners in any irrigation district heretofore organized or hereafter to be organized so desire they may petition the board of directors to call a special election for the purpose of submitting to the qualified electors of such irrigation district a proposal to vote on the modification of such district by the exclusion of land within its boundaries or a proposal to vote on the dissolution of such district, or for the sale or transfer of its water rights, canal system and all or any other property or for dissolution and for sale or transfer, as the case may be. Such petition shall set forth the reasons for such proposal and in case it is proposed to modify said district by the exclusion of lands therein shall set forth particularly the land to be excluded and the reasons therefor. Such petition for modification or dissolution of the district or for such sale or transfer either shall state that all outstanding bonds, warrants and other obligations of every nature whatsoever, legal and enforceable, against said district have been fully satisfied and paid or shall set forth facts showing reasonable ground for the belief that the consent of the holders of all outstanding bonds, warrants and other obligations of the district, legal and enforceable, can be obtained, or that the district is able to satisfy all those not consenting.

The board shall not modify the boundaries set forth in the original petition. Provided however, the board may permit any holder of evidence of title to land lying within the boundaries of the original district of forty (40) acres or more in size used primarily for agricultural purposes to include such land in the new irrigation district, if such landowner has filed a separate petition with the board establishing that such land meets all the criteria required to have been joined in the original petition, including ownership of water rights appurtenant to the land.

Notice of such election shall be published as required for notices of election for indebtedness. At such election should two-thirds (2/3) of the electors voting, vote in favor of said contract and the consolidation of said districts, the board of directors of the smaller district shall petition the board of directors of the larger district, which notice shall be published in a newspaper published within the county wherein the office of the board of directors of the larger district is situated, for such length of time and covering the same matters as required by a petition of a private owner of land to have same included within the boundaries of an irrigation district. The law applicable to the inclusion of land within the boundaries of an irrigation district, after the petition is filed and notice given, shall apply to the consolidating, including and annexing of a smaller district in and to the boundaries of a larger district. After the board of directors of the larger district has made the order including said smaller district within the boundaries of the larger district, the board of directors of the larger district shall file a petition in the district court within the county wherein the principal office of the larger district is situated, asking for an approval and confirmation of the proceedings thereunder, and the same procedure shall be followed as provided by sections 43-406, 43-407, and 43-408[, Idaho Code,] with reference to the confirmation of the proceedings within irrigation districts. In such petition the prayer shall be that the proceedings, together with the contract, may be examined and approved by the court; that after the confirmation of said proceedings the order of the board of directors admitting the smaller district into the larger district, containing a description of all the land properly certified by the secretary of the district, shall be filed for record in the office of the recorder of the county within which said land lies.

      § 43-1705. Proof of reclamation and settlement — Patent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Within one (1) year after the district authorized to construct irrigation works under the provisions of this title shall have notified the settlers under such works that it is prepared to furnish water under the terms of the contract with the state, said settlers shall cultivate and reclaim not less than one-sixteenth (1/16) part of the land filed upon, and within two (2) years after said notice, the settler shall have irrigated and cultivated not less than one-eighth (1/8) of the land filed upon, and within three (3) years after the date of said notice the settler shall appear before the director of the department of water resources, a judge or clerk of any court of record within the state, or a commissioner appointed by the department of water resources, and make final proof of the reclamation, settlement and occupation, which proof shall embrace evidence that he has paid all of the assessments levied and assessed against said land by the district, or he shall present a tax deed issued by the treasurer of said district and also prove that all assessments levied and assessed by the district against said land have been paid; that he has been an actual settler thereon and has cultivated and irrigated not less than one-eighth (1/8) part of said tract; and such further proof, if any, as may be required by the regulations of the department of the interior and the department of water resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      The officer taking this proof shall be entitled to receive a fee of two dollars ($2.00), which fee shall be paid by the settler and shall be in addition to the price paid to the state for the land: provided, that when the director of the department of water resources takes final proof, all fees received by him shall be turned into the state treasury. The commissioners appointed by the department of water resources are hereby authorized to administer oaths.
     </p>
     <p>
      All proofs so received shall be submitted to the department of water resources accompanied by the final payment for the said land, and upon approval of the same by said department, the settler shall be entitled to his patent. If the land shall not be embraced in any patent theretofore issued to the state by the United States, the proof shall be forwarded to the secretary of the interior with the request that a patent to said lands be issued to the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the works designed for the irrigation of lands under the provisions of this chapter shall be so far completed as to actually furnish an ample supply of water in a substantial ditch or canal to reclaim any particular tract or tracts of such lands, the state of Idaho shall, through the department of water resources, make proof of such fact, and shall apply for a patent to such lands in the manner provided in the regulations of the department of the interior.

        Where additions made to spaceholder’s contracts after election approving such contracts were merely procedural, clarifying the manner in which reimbursements, if any, would be made and did not impose any obligations on the spaceholders or landowners which were not already present under prior drafts, it was not necessary to submit such contracts to the voters in another election for approval.

        The contracts actually executed by the districts need not be identical in every respect to the contracts approved by the voters in the election, rather the districts may make minor changes in the details of the contracts without submitting them to the voters provided such changes do not increase the obligation of any irrigation district, but, if the district’s obligation is increased, the modified contracts would have to be resubmitted to the voters for approval.

        This chapter does not require other irrigation districts to enter into contracts with the reservoir district; it merely empowers the districts to do so, and neither this chapter nor Public Law 93-206 requires the reservoir district to act as the constructing agency and to issue the bonds. Kerner v. Johnson, 99 Idaho 433, 583 P.2d 360 (1978).
    This chapter does not impose an agency relationship between the reservoir district and other irrigation districts and does not establish a new entity with authority over the spaceholders in the present dam; this section merely extends the authority of an irrigation district to include the power to improve or replace dams and related structures and it is apparent from this section that where the proposed improvements would inure to the benefit of several irrigation districts or other entities, the legislature intended to authorize an irrigation district to execute contracts for the construction of the entire project and issue bonds to finance the construction and then to enter into repayment contracts with other irrigation districts or other entities benefitting from the improvements and willing to participate in their construction.

        § 43-2202. Issuance of bonds or interim notes — Terms and conditions.
       </h3>
       <p>
        The board of directors is authorized to issue the bonds of the district in the manner for which provision is made in this chapter, which bonds shall be fully negotiable for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code of the state of Idaho as the same may be in force from time to time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds issued hereunder shall be authorized by resolution or resolutions of the board. They shall be in coupon form but may be made registrable as to principal if so provided in the resolution authorizing their issuance. Such bonds shall be in denominations of one hundred dollars ($100) or a multiple thereof, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, payable annually or semiannually as the board shall elect, shall mature serially or otherwise at any time or times, shall be payable at such place or places within or without the state, may be made redeemable prior to maturity in such manner and at such premiums, shall be executed in such manner, and shall be sold in such manner and at such price or prices as may be determined by resolution of the board.

        Bonds may be issued hereunder at one (1) time or from time to time. If more than one (1) issue or series of bonds is delivered hereunder the bonds of the respective issues or series shall have such priorities of payment as may be provided in the proceedings authorizing the bonds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds hereunder shall provide for the creation of a sinking fund into which shall be paid from the revenues and assessments pledged to such payment in the authorizing resolution sums fully sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds and to create such reserve for contingencies as may be required by the resolution. Any resolution so authorizing bonds may contain such covenants with the future holders of the bonds as to the disposition of such revenues and assessments, the issuance of future bonds and the creation of future liens and encumbrances against the revenues and assessments and other pertinent matters deemed necessary or proper by the board to assure the merchantability of the bonds, provided such covenants and agreements are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any resolution, or any contract with another irrigation district, may adopt the provisions of section 43-413, Idaho Code, with respect to the providing of a safety fund with respect to any assessments levied for the repayment of the bonds or the payment of any contract obligation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It may be provided in any such resolution that any holder of the bonds or of any of the coupons thereto attached may by appropriate legal action compel performance of all duties required of the board and the officials of the district by the provisions of title 43, Idaho Code, and the provisions of the resolution authorizing the bonds. If any bond issued hereunder is permitted to go into default, as to principal or interest, any court of competent jurisdiction may, pursuant to the application of the holder of any bond, or if applicable the trustee pursuant to a trust indenture, appoint a receiver to collect and distribute the revenues and assessments pledged to the repayment of the bonds pursuant to the provisions and requirements of the resolution and of this act and as the court may direct.
       </p>
       <p>
        The board of any district which shall have issued any bonds under the provisions of this chapter may authorize the issuance of bonds hereunder for the purpose of refunding all or any part of such outstanding bonds. Refunding bonds may be either sold and the proceeds thereof applied to or deposited in an escrow for the retirement of the outstanding bonds or may be delivered in exchange for the outstanding bonds. The refunding bonds shall be authorized and secured in the manner herein provided for the issuance and securing of other bonds and may but shall not be required to have the same source of security and payment as the bonds refunded. No election on the issuance of refunding bonds shall be required, but if by an increase in the amount of bonds or by changes in the security, the requirements of the constitution for an election become applicable, then any such refunding bonds shall be approved at an election held and conducted pursuant to the provisions of section 43-2203, Idaho Code.
    In addition to the permanent financing contemplated in this section, the board of any district may borrow money and issue interim notes in evidence thereof whenever it is deemed advisable and in the interests of the district to borrow funds temporarily for any of the purposes herein provided in advance of permanent financing. No election shall be required upon the issuance of interim notes. The board may from time to time and pursuant to appropriate resolution borrow money and issue interim notes to evidence borrowings for the purpose of obtaining funds for any of the purposes authorized in subsection (D) of section 43-2201, Idaho Code. Any resolution authorizing the issuance of such interim notes shall describe generally the purpose for which such notes are to be issued and shall specify the principal amount, rate of interest and maturity date, which shall be the same for all interim notes and which shall be not to exceed five (5) years from the date of issue of such notes, and such other pertinent terms as may be specified in such resolution. The interim notes shall be issued from time to time by the board as funds are borrowed, in the manner the board may determine. Interest on the interim notes may be made payable semiannually, annually or at maturity. The interim notes may be made redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the board in the manner and upon the terms fixed by the resolution authorizing their issuance. Such interim notes shall be in such denominations, shall be executed in such manner, and shall be sold at such price or prices as may be determined by resolution of the board. All such interim notes and the interest thereon may be secured by a pledge of the proceeds of the revenues and assessments provided in subsection (D) of section 43-2201, Idaho Code, and shall be payable solely from such revenues and assessments and from the proceeds to be derived from the sale of any bonds for permanent financing authorized to be issued pursuant to this chapter. Contemporaneously with the issue of the bonds as provided by this chapter, all interim notes, even though they may not have then matured, shall be paid, both principal and interest and applicable premium, if any, to date of payment, from the funds derived from the sale of bonds authorized hereunder for the permanent financing, and such interim notes shall thereupon be surrendered and canceled.

      § 43-2203. Election for issuing bonds — Referendum petition.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the board shall by resolution adopted by a four-fifths (4/5) majority of the said board, determine that the interest of said district and the public interest or necessity demand the reconstruction, rehabilitation, replacement and improvement of any dam and other related structures and works together with all necessary appurtenances related thereto, in order to preserve, restore, protect and maintain rights of storage, diversion and delivery of water necessary and appurtenant to the purposes for which such district and other like similarly situated districts were organized and shall set forth the amount of obligation or bonded or other indebtedness proposed to be issued by the district under the provisions of this chapter, said board shall be required to order the submission of the proposition of issuing such obligation or bonded or other indebtedness for the purposes set forth in said resolution to the vote of the qualified electors of the district as defined in section 34-104, Idaho Code, at an election to be held for that purpose only if within fifteen (15) days after the passage of such resolution a referendum petition signed by legal voters equal in number to not less than ten percent (10%) of the electors of the district, based upon the aggregate vote cast at the general election of directors of the district next preceding the filing of such referendum petition, shall be filed with the secretary of the district requesting that an election upon the issuance of such obligation or bonded or other indebtedness be held and conducted under the provisions of this section. Any election required to be held pursuant to a referendum petition filed in accordance with this section for the purpose of submitting any proposition or propositions of incurring such obligation or indebtedness may be held separately, or may be consolidated or held concurrently with any other election authorized by law. The resolution, in addition to such declaration of public interest or necessity, shall recite the objects and purposes for which the indebtedness is proposed to be incurred, the estimated cost of the reconstruction, rehabilitation, replacement or improvement as the case may be, the amount of principal of the indebtedness to be incurred therefor, and the sources of the revenues and assessments pledged to the payment of said bonds, as enumerated in section 43-2201(D)(1), (2), (3) and (4), Idaho Code. The separate election upon the assessments provided for in section 43-2201(D)(1), Idaho Code, shall be held at the same time as and shall be combined with any such election required to be held upon the issuance of the bonds pursuant to a referendum petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such election required to be held hereunder shall be called by resolution, which resolution shall also fix the date upon which such election shall be held, the manner of holding the same and the method of voting for or against the incurring of the indebtedness or issuance of the bonds. Such resolution shall also fix the compensation to be paid the officers of the election and shall designate the precincts and polling places and shall appoint for each polling place, from each precinct from the electors thereof, the officers of such election, which officers shall consist of three (3) judges, one (1) of whom shall act as clerk, who shall constitute a board of election for each polling place. The description of precincts may be made by reference to any order or orders of the board of county commissioners of the county or counties in which the district or any part thereof is situated, or by reference to any previous order, or resolution of the board or by detailed description of such precincts. Precincts established by the boards of the various counties may be consolidated for special elections held hereunder. In the event any such election shall be called to be held concurrently with any other election or shall be consolidated therewith, the resolution calling the election hereunder need not designate precincts or polling places or the names of officers of election, but shall contain reference to the act or order calling such other election and fixing the precincts and polling places and appointing election officers therefrom. The resolution calling the election shall prescribe an official notice of election, which notice shall be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, the last publication of which shall be at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for said election, in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published within the district, and no other or further notice of such election or publication of the names of election officers or of the precincts or polling places need be given or made.
    The respective election boards shall conduct the election in their respective precincts in the manner prescribed by law for the holding of district elections to the extent the same shall apply and shall make their returns to the secretary of the district. At any regular or special meeting of the board held not earlier than five (5) days following the date of such election, the returns thereof shall be canvassed and the results thereof declared.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that no referendum petition is filed, or if so filed, if it shall appear from said returns that a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the qualified electors of the district who shall have voted on any proposition submitted hereunder at such election voted in favor of such proposition, the district shall thereupon be authorized to incur such indebtedness or obligations, enter into such contracts or issue and sell such bonds of the district, all for the purpose or purposes and object or objects provided for in the proposition submitted hereunder or in the resolution therefor, and in the amount so provided. Submission of the proposition of incurring such obligation or bonded or other indebtedness at such an election shall not prevent or prohibit submission of the same or other propositions at subsequent election or elections called for such purpose.

        When more than two-thirds of the landowners of the irrigation district have voted to approve the execution of contracts to repay their proportionate amount of major new capital improvements in order to assure that adequate supplies of water will be available, it cannot be said that the action of the board of directors divests those landowners who voted against the contracts of valuable property rights.

        Although the board’s resolution under this section may become final without some of the landowners within the district having knowledge of its adoption, the landowners will suffer no detriment and no burdens will be placed on their land until they have been given notice of the proposed contracts and assessments and have been afforded an opportunity to approve or reject the proposed actions in an election.

        Where the notices of election as to whether irrigation district should enter into spaceholder’s contract and help finance bonds to build replacement dam specifically stated that delivery of water was contingent upon the execution of the spaceholder contract and upon the continued fulfillment of the obligations under that contract, the notices were sufficient to provide reasonable notice of the chief features of the proposal. Kerner v. Johnson, 99 Idaho 433, 583 P.2d 360 (1978).
    This section does not require notice to the electorate of the adoption by an irrigation district of a resolution imposing a bonded indebtedness upon the lands of the district, which resolution becomes final in 15 days unless a referendum petition is filed, within that time, seeking an election on the question.

Whenever any district which is required to file a petition hereunder has or proposes to enter into a contract or contracts with one or more irrigation districts pursuant to section 43-2201(D)(2), Idaho Code, and such other irrigation district or districts is authorized or required to bring a confirmation proceeding or proceedings pursuant to the provisions of section 43-406 or of section 43-1808, Idaho Code, with respect to such contracts or the levy of assessments or the apportionment of costs, the boards of each of such other irrigation districts shall join in the filing of such petition, and the district court in which such petition is filed shall have jurisdiction to hear the petition and to grant the relief prayed for therein. Each such petition shall pray for a judicial examination and determination of any power conferred hereby or by any amendment hereto or of any assessment levied or of any apportionment of costs or of any act, proceeding or contract of the district or districts, whether or not said contracts shall have been executed, including proposed contracts for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, replacement and improvement of any such dam and other related structures and works and appurtenances, falling water contracts pursuant to section 43-2201(D)(4), Idaho Code, contracts with other irrigation districts pursuant to section 43-2201(D)(2), Idaho Code, and contracts with other public and private persons, firms, corporations and associations pursuant to section 43-2201(D)(3), Idaho Code. Such petition shall set forth the facts whereon the validity of such powers, assessments, apportionments, acts, proceedings or contracts is founded. Notice of the filing of said petition shall be given by the clerk of the court by mailing, and by publication in at least one (1) newspaper published and of general circulation within the boundaries of each irrigation district joining in the petition, or if no newspaper is so published within any district, then in a newspaper published in the same county in which any part of such irrigation district is located which is of general circulation in such irrigation district, pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of section 43-407, Idaho Code, under the seal thereof, stating in brief outline the contents of the petition and showing where a full copy of any contract or contracts, therein mentioned, may be examined.

     <p>
      Any owner of property in any district joining in the petition or any other person interested in the contracts or proposed contracts may appear and answer said petition at any time prior to the date fixed for said hearing or within such further time as may be allowed by the court; and the petition shall be taken as confessed by all persons who fail so to appear. The said petition and notice shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction and, upon hearing, the court shall examine into and determine all matters and things affecting the question submitted, shall examine all of the proceedings of all of the irrigation districts as set forth in the petition, shall hear all objections either filed in said proceeding or brought up from the hearings before any of the boards, shall correct all errors in the assessments and apportionments of costs, shall ratify, approve and confirm all apportionments of costs and assessments levied, shall make such findings with reference thereto and render a judgment and decree thereon approving and confirming all of the powers, assessments, apportionments, acts, proceedings and contracts of each of the irrigation districts as set forth in the petition as the case warrants. Costs may be divided or apportioned among the contesting parties in the discretion of the trial court. Review of the judgment of the court may be had as in other similar cases, except that such review must be applied for within thirty (30) days after the time of the rendition of such judgment, or within such additional time as may be allowed by the court within thirty (30) days. The Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure shall govern in matters of pleading and practice where not otherwise specified herein. The court shall disregard any error, irregularity or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

        The contracts actually executed by the districts need not be identical in every respect to the contracts approved by the voters in the election; rather, the districts may make minor changes in the details of the contracts without submitting them to the voters provided such changes do not increase the obligation of any irrigation district, but, if the district’s obligation is increased, the modified contracts would have to be resubmitted to the voters for approval.

        Where additions made to spaceholder’s contracts after election approving such contracts were merely procedural, clarifying the manner in which reimbursements, if any, would be made and did not impose any obligations on the spaceholders or landowners which were not already present under prior drafts, it was not necessary to submit such contracts to the voters in another election for approval.

        The legislature, by requiring in this section the constructing district to file a confirmation petition and by requiring the other participating districts to join in the petition, intended to spare the irrigation districts the burden of duplicative and repetitious confirmation proceedings in the situation where a number of districts were participating in a joint project to replace a dam.

       <p>
        Although this section directs the court to examine a broad range of matters, it does not require the court to resolve in a confirmation proceeding every legal issue which may arise in connection with the project, particularly a project as massive and complex as the replacement of a major federal dam; rather, the district court in a confirmation proceeding pursuant to this section is only required to consider those matters which affect or are somehow pertinent to the proposed bond issue.

       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the function of the courts in a confirmation proceeding to review the merits of the board’s decision, since those policy decisions belong to the boards of directors and the voting landowners; the court’s duty is limited to determining whether the decision was made and carried out in accordance with the law.

The interim notes shall be issued from time to time by the board as funds are borrowed, in the manner the board may determine. Interest on the interim notes may be made payable semiannually, annually or at maturity. The interim notes may be made redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the board in the manner and upon the terms fixed by the resolution authorizing their issuance. Such interim notes shall be sold at such price or prices as may be determined by resolution of the board. All such interim notes and the interest thereon may be secured by a pledge of the proceeds of the revenues provided in subsection (e) of section 43-2301, Idaho Code, and shall be payable solely from such revenues and from the proceeds to be derived from the sale of any bonds for permanent financing authorized to be issued pursuant to this chapter. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the bonds as provided by this chapter, all interim notes, even though they may not have then matured, shall be paid, both principal and interest and applicable premium, if any, to date of payment, from the funds derived from the sale of bonds authorized hereunder for the permanent financing, and such interim notes shall thereupon be surrendered and canceled.

      Any election required to be held hereunder shall be called by resolution, which resolution shall also fix the date upon which such election shall be held, the manner of holding the same and the method of voting for or against the execution of the contract. Such resolution shall also fix the compensation to be paid the officers of the election and shall designate the precincts and polling places and shall appoint for each polling place, from each precinct from the electors thereof, the officers of such election, which officers shall consist of three (3) judges, one (1) of whom shall act as clerk, who shall constitute a board of election for each polling place. Description of precincts may be made by reference to any order or orders of the board of county commissioners of the county or counties in which the district or any part thereof is situated, or by reference to any previous order, or resolution of the board or by detailed description of such precincts. The resolution calling the election shall prescribe an official notice of election, which notice shall be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, the last publication of which shall be at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for said election, in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in the district, and no other or further notice of such election or publication of the names of election officers or of the precincts or polling places need be given or made.

      § 43-2504. Initiation of organization of local improvement district.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The organization of any local improvement district herein provided for may be initiated upon a petition signed by not less than sixty percent (60%) of the owners of property subject to assessment within such local improvement district, or by resolution of the board adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the full board at a regular or special meeting thereof. The terms of a petition shall include a description of the boundaries of a proposed local improvement district, the improvements to be made and the property to be assessed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may, in its discretion, authorize a preliminary study to determine the feasibility and costs and expenses of a proposed local improvement district and pay for such study out of the general fund of the district. In the event the local improvement district is formed, the cost of the study may be included in the cost of the local improvement district and added to the assessment roll. In the event the local improvement district is not formed, for any reason, the board may authorize the cost of the study to be added to the general assessment rolls of the district as to the property within the proposed local improvement district.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the alternative, the board may, in its discretion, as a condition of the board proceeding further with the formation of the local improvement district, require the petitioners to provide to the district a deposit in an amount determined in the board’s discretion to pay for a preliminary study of the proposed local improvement district to determine the feasibility and costs and expenses of the project.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall include an acknowledgment by the petitioners that the district may require the petitioners to provide to the district a deposit in an amount determined in the board’s discretion to pay for a preliminary study or that the board may, in its discretion, authorize the cost of the study to be paid out of the general fund of the district, with the cost of the study to be included in the cost of the local improvement district and added to the assessment roll if one is formed or to be added to the general assessment rolls of the district as to the property within the proposed local improvement district if the local improvement district is not formed.

     <p>
      Any owner of property to be assessed in the proposed local improvement district described in the notice of intention shall have the right, in advance of the hearing, to file, in writing, a protest to the creation of the district or making any other objections in relation thereto. At the date, time and place specified in the notice of intention the board shall, in open and public session, consider all protests which have been filed in writing in advance of the hearing, and the hearing may be adjourned one (1) or more times at the discretion of the board to a fixed future time and place for the same, by publicly announcing at the hearing the continued date and time for such hearing, until all such protests have been heard. No further or additional notice of any kind shall be required. At any continued hearing, the board shall not consider any protests that were filed after the original hearing date. The decision of the board as to all protests shall be conclusive and final, and if it should so determine, the board may delete any improvements on any property which had originally been contemplated in the said notice. If owners of more than two-thirds (2/3) of the property to be assessed protest any of the proposed improvements which affect their property, the board shall not proceed further with the work so protested unless a majority of the members of the full board shall vote to proceed with such work. The vote on the hereinafter mentioned resolution creating the local improvement district shall constitute the vote as to whether or not the board will proceed. Any property owner who fails to file a protest within the time specified, or having filed one withdraws said protest, shall be deemed to have waived any objection to the creation of the local improvement district, the making of the improvements, and the inclusion of his property in the local improvement district. Such waiver shall not preclude his right to object to the amount of the assessment at the later hearing provided for such purpose.

     <p>
      In cases where written protests are filed and sixty percent (60%) of the owners or the owners of two-thirds (2/3) of the lots and lands within such proposed local improvement district have signed such protest, the board shall not be allowed to proceed with the creation of the local improvement district for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days.
     </p>

      After expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day period, the district may recommence the initiation of a local improvement district as originally proposed or as modified as provided in this chapter.

The board shall appoint an engineer and shall have prepared the necessary plans and specifications for the construction work ordered.

If the board chooses to do so, it shall provide in said resolution that any property owner who has not paid his assessment in full within said thirty (30) day period will be conclusively presumed to have chosen to pay the same in installments, and the resolution shall then establish the number of years said installments shall run, the dates of payment of the same and the rate of interest that the unpaid assessments shall bear, which rate shall not be less than the rate of interest borne by the warrants or bonds payable therefrom, said interest running from the date of the passage of the assessment resolution, irrespective of the date of its official publication, and being payable at the same time and place as the installment payments of assessments. Said installments shall be due and payable in not to exceed thirty (30) years to the treasurer or other proper officer as provided by the board. The resolution shall establish the due date of the first installment payment and that the local or special assessments may be carried on the rolls of the district and collected as hereinafter provided. If any installment is not paid within twenty (20) days from the date it is due, the same shall become delinquent and the treasurer shall add a penalty of two percent (2%) thereto. In addition to any other method of collection provided in this code, the board may certify delinquent installments to the treasurer, and when so certified they shall be extended on the assessment rolls and collected as other assessments levied upon lands in the district. In the event that any property owner should choose to pay his assessment in full after such time as it has been conclusively presumed that he will pay in installments, such payment in full shall include the full amount of the unpaid assessment plus penalties and all interest payable on the same plus additional interest thereon at the rate provided in the bonds from the date of the last installment due to one (1) year after the next interest date of said bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any errors in description, ownership of property or amounts in any assessment resolution adopted pursuant to this section may be corrected by the passage of an amendatory resolution which need set forth only the corrected descriptions or amounts. The passage of such amendatory resolution shall serve only to postpone the thirty (30) day period for payment in full of the assessments actually affected by such amendatory resolution and the due dates of installments of such affected assessments shall be the same as the due dates of installments not affected. Notice of any assessments so affected shall be given in the same manner as hereinafter provided for the giving of notice of assessments.

      Any person who properly has filed objections to the assessment roll or any other person who feels aggrieved by the decision of the board in confirming the same shall have the right to appeal to the district court of any county in which the local improvement district or any portion thereof may be situated. Such appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the resolution confirming the assessment roll by filing a written notice of appeal with the secretary of the district and with the clerk of the district court aforesaid describing the property and objections of the appellant. The appellant shall also provide a bond to the district in a sum to be fixed by the court, but not less than two hundred dollars ($200) with sureties to be approved by the court, conditioned to pay all costs to be awarded to the respondent upon such an appeal. After said thirty (30) day appeal period has run, no one shall have any cause or right of action to contest the legality, formality or regularity of said assessments for any reason whatsoever and, thereafter, said assessments and the liens thereon shall be considered valid and incontestable without limitation.

      If an appeal is filed within said period, the case shall be docketed by the clerk of said court in the name of the person taking the appeal against the district as “an appeal from assessments.” Said cause shall then be at issue and have precedence over all civil cases pending in said court, except proceedings under the act relating to eminent domain by cities and actions of forcible entry and detainer. Such appeal shall be tried in said court as in the case of equitable causes except that no pleadings shall be necessary. The judgment of the court shall be either to confirm, modify or annul the assessment insofar as the same affects the property of the appellant, from which judgment an appeal may be taken to the supreme court as provided by law. In case the assessment is confirmed, the fees of the secretary of the district for copies of the record shall be taxed against the appellant with other costs.

The segregation shall be made as nearly as possible on the same basis as the original assessment was levied, and the total of the segregated parts of the assessment shall equal the assessment before segregation. The resolution shall describe the original tract, the amount and date of the original assessment, and shall define the boundaries of the divided parts and the amount of the assessment chargeable to each part. A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the county recorder. The board may require, as a condition to the order of segregation, that the person seeking the segregation pay the district the reasonable engineering and clerical costs incident to making the segregation. No segregation need be made if the board shall find that by such segregation the security of the lien for the assessment will be so jeopardized as to reduce the security for any outstanding local improvement district obligations payable from such assessment.

Such bonds shall be payable each year from and after the date of the bonds and shall be of such denomination and bear interest, payable annually, at such rate as is determined by the board, but in no event shall such rate of interest be greater than the rate of interest borne by the unpaid assessments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bonds shall be in such form and denomination as may be provided by the board and they shall mature serially over a period not exceeding thirty (30) years. The board may reserve the right to redeem any of the bonds at its option on any interest payment at such price or prices as determined by the board. The bonds shall be signed by the president of the district, and shall be countersigned by the treasurer and attested by the secretary of the district. No bond or coupon shall be invalid because an officer whose manual or facsimile signature thereon has ceased to hold office at the time of the delivery of the bonds so long as he held the office at the time such signature was placed on the bond or coupon. The coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of said officers and each bond shall have the seal of the district affixed thereto. Each bond shall provide that the principal thereof and the interest thereon are payable solely from the principal of and interest on the unpaid assessments levied in the local improvement district to pay the total cost and expenses of the project concerned.

      In lieu of bonds, registered warrants may be issued under the same circumstances and in the same manner as bonds, such warrants to be issued in payment of any or all costs or expenses of the improvements to the amount said costs or expenses were set out in the engineer’s report. The warrants shall be redeemable in numerical order and further shall be subject to all provisions of this code relating to local improvement bonds so far as the same may be applicable.

      If the board shall determine to issue and sell bonds, it may for the purpose of meeting any costs and expenses of making the improvements, as the same are installed prior to the sale of the bonds, issue interim warrants of the local improvement district, payable to the contractor or other proper person upon estimates of the engineer, bearing interest at a rate provided by the board, which interim warrants together with the interest due thereon at the date of the issue of the bonds, shall be redeemed and retired from the proceeds of the sale of the bonds or prepayment of assessments.

      Bonds issued hereunder shall have all the requisites of negotiable paper under the uniform commercial code, and shall not be invalid for irregularity or defect in the proceedings for their issuance, sale or delivery, and shall be incontestable in the hands of bona fide purchasers or holders for value thereof. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit any district from issuing bonds or warrants in the denomination of one hundred dollars ($100), or an even multiple thereof, except that bond number one (1) of any issue may be of a denomination other than one hundred dollars ($100).
