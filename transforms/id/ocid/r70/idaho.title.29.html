       <p>
        Where the purchaser of a poultry business agreed to pay the business’s debts, including a debt to a poultry supplier, and that agreement was supported by adequate consideration and not rescinded, the supplier was a third-party beneficiary of the contract and was entitled to assert and have judgment in its favor by way of setoff against a debt owed by the supplier to the purchaser. Treasure Valley Foods, Inc. v. J-M Poultry Packing Co., 98 Idaho 366, 564 P.2d 978 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where buyer agreed in a lease contract, executed with the purchase of the seller’s land, to pay the seller’s arrearage with a power company, the power company could not enforce that lease provision against the buyer because the lease was executed only to provide cash flow to the buyer and to the seller to continue to operate a business on the land; hence, the company was not an intended beneficiary of the lease contract. Idaho Power Co. v. Hulet, 140 Idaho 110, 90 P.3d 335 (2004).

        A contract between the lessee-grower and crop purchaser, which enumerated the rights and duties of those parties toward each other, was not drawn expressly for the benefit of the farmowner lessor; thus, the farmowner was not entitled to demand performance from the crop purchaser. Wing v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., 106 Idaho 905, 684 P.2d 307 (Ct. App. 1984), overruled on other grounds, NBC Leasing Co. v. R & T Farms, Inc., 112 Idaho 500, 733 P.2d 721 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before recovery can be had by a third party beneficiary, it must be shown that the contract was made for his direct benefit or, as sometimes stated, primarily for his benefit; it is not sufficient that he be a mere incidental beneficiary. Adkison Corp. v. American Bldg. Co., 107 Idaho 406, 690 P.2d 341 (1984).
    Where a contract was not made expressly for the benefit of any of the plaintiffs as third parties to the arrangement between the contracting parties, and where it referenced Utah law in a generalized statement that the rights and obligations of the parties should be governed in accordance with the laws of Utah, this did not suffice to invoke the terms of this section, and the district court’s decision that the plaintiffs, who did not have valid liens, could recover under the Utah bond statutes as an alternative theory was vacated. Great Plains Equip., Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., 132 Idaho 754, 979 P.2d 627 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the owners entered into a contract with the general contractor for the design of a cabin and the supply of construction materials, the owners were not permitted to directly sue a subcontractor for breach of contract as a third party beneficiary where the benefits the owners received from the subcontractor’s performance were merely incidental. Nelson v. Anderson Lumber Co., 140 Idaho 702, 99 P.3d 1092 (Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Client, the promisor, directed his promise to pay to the company, making the company the named promisee of the note, and as such, the company did not have an enforceable right against the client as a third party beneficiary but, rather, had an enforceable right as the promisee of the note so long as the note was otherwise enforceable; thus, the district court’s holding that the company may enforce the note as a third party beneficiary was made in error. Sirius LC v. Erickson, 144 Idaho 38, 156 P.3d 539 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not give a party to a contract the right to enforce the contract against a nonparty on the ground that the nonparty is a third-party beneficiary to the contract. Clearwater REI, LLC v. Boling, 155 Idaho 954, 318 P.3d 944 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Company was not a third-party beneficiary of the bid contract between a business and a general contractor, for purposes of this section, given that the contract did not clearly show an intent expressly to benefit the company. De Groot v. Standley Trenching, Inc., 157 Idaho 557, 338 P.3d 536 (2014).

       <p>
        California and Oklahoma have statutes providing that third party beneficiaries may sue to enforce nonrescinded contracts. See Cal. Civ. Code, § 1559 and Okla. Stat., tit. 15, § 29. These statutes have been interpreted to leave untouched the doctrine that after acceptance or reliance, a third party beneficiary contract cannot be unilaterally rescinded. Baldwin v. Leach, 115 Idaho 713, 769 P.2d 590 (Ct. App. 1989).

       <p>
        The federal court decisions permit a third person, not a party to a contract, to enforce the promissory obligation only where he is the beneficiary solely interested in the promise. Twin Falls Canal Co. v. American Falls Reservoir Dist. No. 2, 59 F.2d 19 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 287 U.S. 638, 53 S. Ct. 87, 77 L. Ed. 552 (1932).

       <p>
        The contract itself must express an intent to benefit the third party; this intent must be gleaned from the contract itself unless that document is ambiguous, whereupon the circumstances surrounding its formation may be considered. Adkison Corp. v. American Bldg. Co., 107 Idaho 406, 690 P.2d 341 (1984).

        Under Idaho law, if a party can demonstrate that a contract was made expressly for his benefit, he may enforce that contract, at any time prior to rescission, as a third party beneficiary. Baldwin v. Leach, 115 Idaho 713, 769 P.2d 590 (Ct. App. 1989).
    There was no evidence in the record showing that hauler and farmer intended to benefit dairyman when they entered into an agreement regarding the hauler handling hay produced by the farmer. At most, dairyman was only an “incidental beneficiary” within hauler’s contemplation when the agreement was made. Hilt v. Draper, 122 Idaho 612, 836 P.2d 558 (Ct. App. 1992).

        If a party can demonstrate that a contract was made expressly for its benefit, it may enforce that contract, prior to recision, as a third-party beneficiary; the test for determining a party’s status as a third-party beneficiary, capable of properly invoking the protection of this section, is whether the agreement reflects an intent to benefit the third party. Seubert Excavators, Inc. v. Eucon Corp., 125 Idaho 744, 874 P.2d 555 (Ct. App. 1993), rev’d on other grounds, 125 Idaho 409, 871 P.2d 826 (1994).

        Under this section, if a party can demonstrate that a contract was made expressly for its benefit, it may enforce that contract, prior to rescission, as a third-party beneficiary. The test for determining a party’s status as a third-party beneficiary, capable of properly invoking the protection of this section, is whether the agreement reflects an intent to benefit the third party. The third party must show that the contract was made primarily for his benefit, and that it is not sufficient that he be a mere incidental beneficiary. Further, the contract itself must express an intent to benefit the third party. This intent must be gleaned from the contract itself unless that document is ambiguous, whereupon the circumstances surrounding its formation may be considered. Am. W. Enters. v. CNH, LLC, 155 Idaho 746, 316 P.3d 662 (2013).

        Absent a manifest intent to the contrary, construction contracts between a contractor and a state or other public body for highway repair or construction of a new highway are generally not considered as being for the benefit of third persons, but are, on the one hand, for the benefit of the state in the performance of its duties to maintain highways on behalf of the public and, on the other hand, for the benefit of the contractor by way of compensation to be paid.

        Provisions of contract between local improvement district and construction company, whereby construction company agreed to provide continuous ingress and egress to and from all businesses that might be affected by the work and to protect such businesses from damages, obligated the construction company to take certain precautionary measures for the benefit of a limited, defined class of third parties, the businesses within the local improvement district; thus, members of that class of third-party beneficiaries were entitled to sue for the construction company’s alleged breach of those contract provisions.

        Contention of appellants that trial court committed error in sustaining respondent’s objection to a question propounded to appellant whereby the witness was asked to explain what consideration was paid him by the corporation for the execution of the note and mortgage involved in this suit, such objection, being that an attempt was being made to alter a written instrument by parol evidence, was not sustained, in view of the fact that there was no issue under the pleadings regarding the consideration of either instrument nor anything pleaded by either party claiming want or failure of consideration or fraud on the part of any party.
