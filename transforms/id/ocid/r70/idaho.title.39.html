       The goal of the legislature in enacting the ground water quality protection act of 1989 shall be to maintain the existing high quality of the state’s ground water and to satisfy existing and projected future beneficial uses including drinking water, agricultural, industrial and aquacultural water supplies. All ground water shall be protected as a valuable public resource against unreasonable contamination or deterioration.

         The discovery of any contamination that poses a threat to existing or projected future beneficial uses of ground water shall require appropriate actions to prevent further contamination.

      § 39-104A. Authority to make rules regulating large swine feeding operations — Financial assurances.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c01s39-104Aol11">
       The state of Idaho is experiencing the development of large swine feeding operations which are inadequately controlled through existing state regulatory mechanisms. If not properly regulated, these facilities pose a threat to the state’s surface and ground water resources. Due to existing rulemaking authority, the department of environmental quality is in the best position of all state agencies to modify its present rules and to make new rules to develop an adequate regulatory framework for large swine feeding operations.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-104Aol12">
       The department of environmental quality is authorized to modify its existing administrative rules and to make new rules regulating large swine feeding operations, as they shall be defined by the department. The department is authorized to work with the Idaho department of agriculture in the development of such rules.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-104Aol13">
       Owners and operators of swine facilities required to obtain a permit from the department of environmental quality to construct, operate, expand or close the facilities shall provide financial assurances demonstrating financial capability to meet requirements for operation and closure of the facilities and remediation. Requirements for financial assurances shall be determined by the agency as set forth in rule. Financial assurances may include any mechanism or combination of mechanisms meeting the requirements established by agency rule including, but not limited to, surety bonds, trust funds, irrevocable letters of credit, insurance and corporate guarantees. The mechanism(s) used to demonstrate financial capability must be legally valid, binding and enforceable under applicable law and must ensure that the funds necessary to meet the costs of closure and remediation will be available whenever the funds are needed. The director may retain financial assurances for up to five (5) years after closure of a facility to ensure proper closure and remediation, as defined by rule.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-104Aol14">
       Those swine facilities described in section 39-7905, Idaho Code, shall meet the requirements of section 39-7907, Idaho Code, in addition to the requirements of this chapter and the department of environmental quality’s rules regulating swine facilities, prior to the issuance of a final permit by the director. The director shall require that swine facilities be constructed in a phased manner over a period of time and that no additional facilities be constructed until the director approves the associated waste treatment system.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-104Aol15">
       Nothing in this section prohibits the boards of county commissioners of any county or the governing body of any city from adopting regulations that are more stringent or that require greater financial assurances than those imposed by the department of environmental quality. A board of county commissioners of a county or a governing body of a city in which a swine facility is located may choose to determine whether the facility is properly closed according to imposed standards or may leave that determination to the department. This choice shall be communicated to the director in writing when closure begins; provided that determinations of closure by a board of county commissioners of a county or a governing body of a city in which the swine facility is located shall not permit closure under less stringent requirements than those imposed by the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-104Aol16">
       As used in this section:
    (a) “Animal unit” means a unit equaling two and one-half (2.5) swine, each weighing over twenty-five (25) kilograms (approximately fifty-five (55) pounds), or ten (10) weaned swine, each weighing under twenty-five (25) kilograms. Total animal units are calculated by adding the number of swine weighing over twenty-five (25) kilograms multiplied by four-tenths (.4) plus the number of weaned swine weighing under twenty-five (25) kilograms multiplied by one-tenth (.1).

       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Waterborne nutrients, including phosphorus and nitrogen, provide nourishment for aquatic plants and fish.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Nutrient enrichment or overloading can result in overfeeding aquatic plant life, and a subsequent increase in the growth of algae.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Nitrogen, phosphorus and the other nutrient elements are naturally occurring elements that exist in all living things and are essential to all life.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Nutrients enter the water through rainfall, land runoff, decomposition of plants and animals, and other nonpoint sources as well as from point sources, including discharges from industrial operations and sewage treatment facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) Effective nutrient management requires an understanding of a complicated array of technical factors, including nutrient sources, nutrient removal and use and the ability of a water body to clean itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(f) State and federal agencies are currently conducting comprehensive technical analyses to determine the magnitude of nutrient enrichment in certain bodies of water in the state of Idaho and to recommend methods to resolve potential nutrient overloading.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(g) A comprehensive statewide nutrient management plan offers a mechanism to facilitate collection and coordination of the information for a strong technical base to define methods to protect the rivers and lakes of the state of Idaho from nutrient overloading.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Therefore, it is hereby declared that the purposes of this act are:

       </p>
       <p>

        “(a) That the waters of Priest lake are threatened with deterioration that may endanger that natural beauty, wildlife and fisheries value, recreational use and economic potential of Priest lake.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) That preservation and protection of Priest lake and maintenance of the use and enjoyment of the lake is in the best interest of all citizens of the state.”

        Plaintiffs, asserting sensitivity to grass smoke, asserted that the burning of grass by seed growers constituted a trespass and a nuisance and that the immunity granted to the seed growers under a former law was unconstitutional. The supreme court disagreed. The amendments did not act as an unconstitutional taking of property, and they were not an unconstitutional special and local law. Moon v. N. Idaho Farmers Ass’n, 140 Idaho 536, 96 P.3d 637 (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1146, 125 S. Ct. 1299, 161 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2005).

        Section 1 of S.L. 2005, ch. 292 provided “Statement of Legislative Intent. The definition of ‘regulated air pollutant’ for purposes of determining whether permit to construct or permit to operate requirements apply, was intended to comply with but not exceed federal clean air act requirements. The Legislature intends that the Department of Environmental Quality uniformly apply Idaho law in an effort to conform with but not differ from federal definitions of regulated air pollutants. Nevertheless, the United States District Court for Idaho has applied portions of rules of the Department of Environmental Quality for air pollution in a manner which substantially exceeds federal requirements. This act is meant to clarify that Idaho law in this regard has always been intended to comply with but not exceed federal law and should not be construed as a change in the law, but rather a clarification of what the existing law has consistently meant.”

      The director shall have the authority to issue compliance schedule orders to any person who is the source of any health hazard, air contaminant, water pollution or solid waste for which regulatory standards have been established, including regulatory standards then in effect or to become effective at a future date or at future successive dates. The purpose of any compliance schedule order shall be to identify and establish appropriate acts and time schedules for interim actions by those persons who are or who will be affected by regulatory standards, such acts and schedules being designed to assure timely compliance by those affected by the regulatory standards. Prior to the issuance of a compliance schedule order, the director shall solicit the cooperation of the person to whom the compliance schedule order will be directed by providing the person notice that identifies with reasonable specificity the applicable statutes and rules, the events or occurrences that necessitate the order, and the proposed terms of the order and that informs the person that a conference with the director to discuss the proposed terms of the order shall be provided if requested within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice. If requested, the director shall confer with the person and shall solicit the person’s cooperation in the selection of the terms of the order. The compliance schedule order may be issued at any time after the conference, if one is requested, and the expiration of sixty (60) days following the receipt of the notice. Any compliance schedule order shall be enforceable in the same manner as any order entered pursuant to section 39-108, Idaho Code, except the order may be challenged by an administrative appeal to the board as provided in section 39-107(5), Idaho Code. The order shall be effective and enforceable during an administrative appeal, unless the board or its designated hearing officer issues a stay of the order.

       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Maintaining the air quality of the state of Idaho to protect human health and the environment is a paramount concern and responsibility of the legislature.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Due to the diminishing capacity of landfills nationwide and the increased costs of waste disposal, the amount of medical waste proposed for disposal by combustion in Idaho has and will increase significantly.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) The burning of medical waste, while an acceptable and effective form of disposal if controlled by reasonable measures, can create air emissions adversely affecting human health and the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Existing state rules and regulations do not adequately control the emission of air contaminants from medical waste combustors.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) The state’s comprehensive efforts to preserve its valuable air quality resources are being threatened by the potential of an unrestricted increase in medical waste.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(f) Uncontrolled increases in medical waste combustion can cause increased odors, noise, truck traffic and other significant adverse effects on local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(g) The state’s air quality resources will be threatened by the increased combustion of medical waste unless existing air resources are conserved to meet the needs of the state and a fair share of the need of other states.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(h) The amount of medical waste currently brought into or sent out of large regions of the state for purposes of combustion is negligible, and reasonable requirements controlling the combustion of these materials generated outside of large regions of the state will not adversely affect industry or commerce inside or outside large regions of the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(i) The effective local management of sewage, drinking water, traffic, health protection, and other local government concerns is dependent on the thorough knowledge of all the projected impacts of a proposed medical waste combustor proposed within the jurisdiction of a local government.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Therefore, it is hereby declared that the purposes of this act are:
       </p>

        “(a) To direct the department to develop and propose, and the board to adopt, rules and regulations controlling the emission of air contaminants from medical waste combustors.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) To establish a mechanism to control the amount of medical waste combusted within each major region of the state to those generated within the region plus a reasonable portion of these materials generated outside the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) To ensure that Idaho adequately conserves its air quality resources in a manner which protects human health and the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) To ensure that local communities and governments are provided with comprehensive information and the ability to ensure compliance with local requirements for any proposed medical waste combustor prior to the processing of a state air quality permit.”

      <li id="t39c01s39-171ol11">
       Wood and mill yard debris is a byproduct of wood processing and manufacturing; and

       This guidance will enable the department and local units of government to more effectively regulate the use or disposal of wood and mill yard debris.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The purpose of sections 39-171 through 39-174, Idaho Code, is to provide guidance for the sound use, storage, management and disposal of wood and mill yard debris by requiring the director of the department of environmental quality to appoint a committee to study the issues and to gather and disseminate information to persons and entities that deal with wood and mill yard debris.

      The legislature cannot conveniently or advantageously set forth in this chapter all the requirements of all of the regulations which have been or will be established under the clean water act. However, any state permitting program must avoid the existence of duplicative, overlapping or conflicting state and federal regulatory systems. Further, the board may promulgate rules to implement a state permitting program but such rules shall not impose conditions or requirements more stringent or broader in scope than the clean water act and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Further, the department will not require Idaho pollutant discharge elimination system (IPDES) permits for activities and sources not required to have permits by the United States environmental protection agency.

         Today, state and local vital records offices record over eleven million (11,000,000) vital events annually in the United States;

        </li>
        <li id="t39c02s39-240ol12e">
         Numerous courts have recognized that the purpose of vital records is to maintain an accurate database of factual information regarding births, deaths, and other vital events in a given jurisdiction. See

        </li>
        <li id="t39c02s39-240ol12f">
         According to the national research council committee on national statistics, factual information contained in vital records is used to help diagnose and solve problems that impact national health, including tracking and diagnosing disparities in mortality rates based on age and sex, identifying factors that account for the significant differences in life expectancy between males and females, measuring and seeking solutions to socioeconomic inequalities in health based on sex and age, and studying infant death rates based on sex, location, birth weight, and other information collected from vital records;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c02s39-240ol12g">
         Factual information from vital records is also necessary for national security. It is used to identify potential disease epidemics, such as the zika virus, that may disproportionately impact one sex over the other; expose covert bioterrorist attacks, such as determining whether a sudden increase in certain symptoms in a population is due to random chance or should be further investigated; and identify criminals and terrorists, where vital records can be used to uncover fraudulently obtained driver’s licenses or passports; and
    (h) Allowing individuals to alter their vital records, including birth certificates, based upon subjective feelings or experiences undermines the government’s interest in having accurate vital records.

          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11ai">
           There is a compelling interest in maintaining accurate, quantitative, biology-based material facts on Idaho certificates of birth that provide material facts fundamental to the performance of government functions that secure the public health and safety, including but not limited to identifying public health trends, assessing risks, conducting criminal investigations, and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders;
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11aii">
           The equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution prohibits purposeful discrimination, not facially neutral laws of general applicability, such as a biology-based definition of sex that has been consistently applied since our nation’s founding;
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11aiii">
           Decades of court opinion have upheld the argument that biological distinctions between male and female are a matter of scientific fact, and biological sex is an objectively defined category that has obvious, immutable, and distinguishable characteristics;
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11aiv">
           Identification of biological sex on a birth certificate impacts the health and safety of all individuals. For example, the society for evidence based gender medicine has declared that the conflation of sex and gender in health care is alarming, subjects hundreds of thousands of individuals to the risk of unintended medical harm, and will greatly impede medical research;
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11av">
           Vital statistics are defined in section 39-241(21), Idaho Code, as data, being the plural of datum, which is a known fact;
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11avi">
           Idaho certificates of birth are of an evidentiary character and prima facie evidence of the facts recited therein, according to section 39-274, Idaho Code;
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11avii">
           Age and sex, unlike the names of natural parents whose rights have been terminated, are legally applicable facts fundamental to the performance of public and private policies and contracts;
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11aviii">
           The failure to maintain accurate, quantitative vital statistics and legal definitions upon which the government and others may with confidence rely constitutes a breach of the public trust; and
          </li>
          <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol11aix">
           The government has a compelling interest in maintaining the public trust and confidence and a duty to fulfill, to the best of its ability, those functions that rely on accurate vital statistics.

        </li>
        <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol1a">
         Based on the findings in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the legislature directs that an Idaho certificate of birth shall document specific quantitative, material facts at the time of birth, as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

      <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol12">
       Any certificate of birth issued under the provisions of this chapter shall include the following quantitative statistics and material facts specific to that birth: time of birth, date of birth, sex, birth weight, birth length, and place of birth.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol13">
       For purposes of this chapter, “sex” means the immutable biological and physiological characteristics, specifically the chromosomes and internal and external reproductive anatomy, genetically determined at conception and generally recognizable at birth, that define an individual as male or female.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol14">
       The quantitative statistics and material facts identified in subsection (2) of this section may be amended within one (1) year of the filing of the certificate by submitting to the registrar a notarized affidavit of correction that:
    (a) Is on a form prescribed by the registrar;
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol14i">
         The parents identified on the certificate of birth; or

         The child’s legal guardian;
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol15">
       In those instances in which an individual suffers from a physiological disorder of sexual development and the individual’s biological sex cannot be recognized at birth as male or female based upon externally observable reproductive anatomy, the physician shall make a presumptive determination of the individual’s sex, which may thereafter be amended based on the appropriate combination of genetic analysis and evaluation of the individual’s naturally occurring internal and external reproductive anatomy as provided in section (4) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c02s39-245Aol16">
       Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a hospital may correct a birth certificate for a clerical or data entry error at any time by submitting a notarized affidavit on a form specified by the registrar with any appropriate supporting documentation.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      After one (1) year, the quantitative statistics and material facts identified in subsection (2) of this section may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the party challenging the acknowledgment.

      § 39-257. Marriage of natural parents of person born in Idaho — Judicial determination of parentage of person born in Idaho — New birth certificates — Procedure.
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a person born in Idaho has been legitimated by the subsequent marriage of said person’s natural parents and immediately assumes or is assigned a name other than is shown on the recorded birth certificate, the birth certificate of such person may be replaced by a new and conventional certificate (prepared and filed by the state registrar), reflecting the name so assumed or assigned, upon proper application therefor filed by such legitimated person or the parents or one of them, but no one else. Such application shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by a copy of the relevant marriage certificate (if there was one issued and regardless of where it was issued), certified by the issuer or recorder of the same, and, in any event, an affidavit of each of the spouses, factually indicating such parentage, the time and place of the marriage, the identity of the child concerned and the child named in the original birth certificate and giving the assumed or assigned name of the child, which instruments shall be filed of record along with the old birth certificate, but separate from any replacement issued hereunder (which shall be filed separately).
     </p>
     <p>
      When a person born in Idaho has had said person’s natural parentage finally determined by an Idaho court, the court shall require the preparation of a report of paternity on a form prescribed and furnished by the state registrar. The report shall include such facts as necessary to complete the amended birth certificate and be certified by the clerk of the court. If a court of some other state issued a decree or report of paternity, the state registrar may prepare and file a new and conventional birth certificate for that person, reflecting the name(s) of the parent(s) and the child’s new name, if applicable, upon application made by that person or either or both of the persons adjudged to be the natural parent(s), or that person’s guardian, but no one else. This application shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the court decree in question and an affidavit of one (1) person factually indicating that the decree involves the same person that the original birth certificate involved. These instruments shall be filed of record along with the old birth certificate, but separate from any replacement issued hereunder (which shall be filed separately).
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of each clerk of court in the state of Idaho to file with the state registrar certified copies of each final decree of paternity determination made by that court within fifteen (15) days after each of such decrees becomes final. Such certified copies of such decrees and all other instruments mentioned in this section, except any replacement certificate, are confidential and shall not be revealed to any person other than the registrant, if of age, the parents or the duly appointed legal representative of any of them, or upon court order issued in the interest of justice.

The examination will be conducted pursuant to rules promulgated by the state board of health and welfare for the purpose of determining those matters required for the issuance of an original birth certificate. Upon the examination of the doctor made pursuant to the rules of the state board of health and welfare, the court may order the vital statistics unit to issue an original birth certificate for the adoptive child based upon those facts determined by the examination and included in the court’s order. In such case a certified copy of the court order shall be provided to the vital statistics unit.

In a case where a single person adopts another person, any new birth certificate may designate the adopting parent as adoptive.

Unless otherwise directed by the court, the vital statistics unit shall amend the certificate of birth upon receipt of a certified copy of an amended decree of adoption. Upon receipt of a certified copy of a decree of annulment or rescindment of adoption, the original certificate of birth shall be restored to its place in the files and the new certificate and evidence shall not be subject to inspection except upon order of a court of record of this state.

      § 39-269. Disinterment — Rules.
     </h3>
     <p>
      No body or stillborn fetus shall be disinterred within the state of Idaho except upon a permit granted by the state registrar of vital statistics. The forms of disinterment permits shall be prepared by the state registrar. Disinterment and removal must be done under the personal supervision of a licensed mortician, and only upon verified application of the person or persons having the highest authority under the provisions of section 54-1142, Idaho Code. Only such persons as are actually necessary shall be present. The coffin shall not be opened either at place of disinterment or place of destination, except special permit be issued by the state registrar. And in case of disinterment of bodies dead by reason of contagious and infectious diseases, as shown by the certificate of death given by the certifying physician or coroner, the sexton and all other persons engaged in such removal or being present shall immediately thereafter change and disinfect their clothing and properly disinfect their hands, head and face, provided, that such disinterment may also be governed by rules promulgated by the state board of health and welfare and a synopsis of the same shall be printed on the back of every permit. In case of any contagious and infectious disease where remains are to be shipped to points in other states, permission must first be obtained from the state health officer of such state. The state registrar may also issue a special disinterment permit for legal purposes. This permit for legal purposes shall be granted only upon application of a prosecuting attorney, the attorney general of this state, or the coroner of the county in which the body is interred, stating therein such facts which make it evident to the state registrar that the ends of justice require that disinterment be permitted. Such special disinterment for legal purposes shall be governed by rules promulgated by the state board of health and welfare and a synopsis of the same shall be printed on the back of every such special disinterment permit for legal purposes. Bodies in a receiving vault when prepared by a licensed mortician shall not be regarded as disinterred bodies until after the expiration of thirty (30) days.

     <p>
      It is the policy of this state that alcoholics, intoxicated persons or drug addicts may not be subjected to criminal prosecution or incarceration solely because of their consumption of alcoholic beverages or addiction to drugs but rather should be afforded treatment in order that they may lead normal lives as productive members of society.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature hereby finds and declares that it is essential to the health and welfare of the people of this state that action be taken by state government to effectively and economically utilize federal and state funds for alcoholism and drug addiction research, and the prevention and for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics or drug addicts. To achieve this, it is necessary that existing fragmented, uncoordinated and duplicative alcoholism and drug treatment programs be merged into a comprehensive and integrated system for the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature continues to recognize the need for criminal sanctions for those who violate the provisions of the uniform controlled substances act.

       An intoxicated or drug addicted person may come voluntarily to an approved public treatment facility for emergency treatment. A person who appears to be intoxicated in a public place and to be in need of help, if he consents to the proffered help, may be assisted to his home, an approved public treatment facility, an approved private treatment facility, or other health facility by a law enforcement officer.
      </li>

       A person who appears to be incapacitated by alcohol or drugs shall be taken into protective custody by a law enforcement officer and forthwith brought to an approved treatment facility for emergency treatment. If no approved treatment facility is readily available he may be taken to a city or county jail where he may be held until he can be transported to an approved treatment facility, but in no event shall such confinement extend more than twenty-four (24) hours. A law enforcement officer, in detaining the person and in taking him to an approved treatment facility, is taking him into protective custody and shall make every reasonable effort to protect his health and safety. In taking the person into protective custody, the detaining officer may take reasonable steps to protect himself. A taking into protective custody under this section is not an arrest. No entry or other record shall be made to indicate that the person has been arrested or charged with a crime.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c03s39-307Aol1c">
       A person who comes voluntarily or is brought to an approved treatment facility shall be examined as soon as possible. He may then be admitted as a patient or referred to another health facility. The referring approved treatment facility shall arrange for his transportation.

       A person who by examination is found to be incapacitated by alcohol or drugs at the time of his admission or to have become incapacitated at any time after his admission, may not be detained at the facility (1) once he is no longer incapacitated by alcohol or drugs or (2) if he remains incapacitated by alcohol or drugs for more than seventy-two (72) hours after admission as a patient. A person may consent to remain in the facility as long as the person in charge believes appropriate.

      <li id="t39c03s39-307Aol1e">
       If a patient is admitted to an approved treatment facility, his family or next of kin shall be notified as promptly as possible. If an adult patient who is not incapacitated requests that there be no notification, his request shall be respected.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c03s39-307Aol1f">
       Law enforcement officers, personnel of the department, and personnel of an alcohol or drug treatment facility who act in compliance with this section are acting in the course of their official duty and are not criminally or civilly liable therefor.

       That any person taken to a seventy-two (72) hour evaluation and treatment facility shall be informed immediately that he has the right to request and take a chemical test in order to ascertain whether he is an intoxicated or addicted person. If the person requests to take the test and the professional person in charge of the facility then determines that the person taken to the facility is not intoxicated or addicted, he shall immediately release him. A record shall be maintained by the facility of the results of the test.

      § 39-401. Legislative intent.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The various health districts, as provided for in this chapter, are not a single department of state government unto themselves, nor are they a part of any of the twenty (20) departments of state government authorized by section 20, article IV, Idaho constitution, or of the departments prescribed in section 67-2402, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is legislative intent that health districts operate and be recognized not as state agencies or departments, but as governmental entities whose creation has been authorized by the state, much in the manner as other single purpose districts. Pursuant to this intent, and because health districts are not state departments or agencies, health districts are exempt from the required participation in the services of the purchasing agent or employee liability coverage, as rendered by the department of administration. However, nothing shall prohibit the health districts from entering into contractural [contractual] arrangements with the department of administration, or any other department of state government or an elected constitutional officer, for these or any other services.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is legislative intent to affirm the provisions of section 39-413, Idaho Code, requiring compliance with the state merit system, and to affirm the participation of the health districts in the public employee retirement system, pursuant to section 39-426, Idaho Code, chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code, and chapter 53, title 67, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also legislative intent that the matters of location of deposit of health district funds, or the instruments or documents of payment from those funds shall be construed as no more than items of convenience for the conduct of business, and in no way reflect upon the nature or status of the health districts as entities of government.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section merely affirms that health districts created under this chapter are not state agencies, and in no way changes the character of those agencies as they existed prior to this act.

        Through the 1992 amendment to § 39-421, it appears that the legislature intended that the expenses of special counsel should be recovered from persons violating this chapter. If the legislature intended to include attorney fees in the “any expense” provision of this section alone, then the amendment to § 39-421 would have been superfluous because the costs of special counsel would already have been covered by this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The protection of ground water quality is essential for life, health and furthering matters of commerce. Multiple public agencies have regulatory jurisdiction over various aspects of everyday human activity that can and do pose risks to vital underground water supplies. Enforcement of current rules and regulations, implementation of educational programs, and inspection of potential sources of pollution require funding beyond the budgets of agencies charged with these responsibilities. The coordination of work by public agencies to assist in the prevention of degradation of valuable ground water can be a cost-effective alternative to after the fact remediation of a degraded resource. Certain ground water quality problems cannot be remedied, only prevented. The purposes of establishing an aquifer protection district include protection of the state’s economy, maintaining a water supply that does not require extensive treatment prior to human consumption or commercial use, avoiding the economic costs of remedial action, and protecting the well-being of communities that depend upon aquifers for essential human needs.

       All persons who shall be confined or imprisoned in any state prison facility in this state shall be examined for on admission, and again upon the offender’s request before release, and, if infected, treated for the diseases enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code, and this examination shall include a test for HIV antibodies or antigens. This examination is not intended to limit any usual or customary medical examinations that might be indicated during a person’s imprisonment. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to interfere with the service of any sentence imposed by a court as a punishment for the commission of crime. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to impose upon any state prison facility an obligation to continue to treat a person who tested positive for any disease enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code, or be financially responsible for such treatment after the person is released from the state prison facility.

Whenever a prisoner tests positive for HIV antibodies or antigens, the victim(s) of said prisoner shall be entitled to counseling regarding HIV, HIV testing in accordance with applicable law, and referral for appropriate health care and support services. Said counseling, HIV testing and referral services shall be provided to the victim(s) by the district health departments at no charge to the victim(s).

        In order to find the defendant guilty of transferring body fluid which may have contained the HIV virus, the jury needed to conclude only that the defendant knowingly transferred or attempted to transfer his body fluid to the victim without first informing her of his HIV status.

        Defendant was properly convicted of transferring body fluid that might contain the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after engaging in oral sex with a woman without advising her of his HIV status. One can transfer one’s body fluid via oral-genital contact and “body fluid” includes saliva. State v. Mubita, 145 Idaho 925, 188 P.3d 867 (2008), overruled on other grounds, Verska v.

        Where the defendant had previous sexual encounters while HIV positive without informing his partner, and the current offense for which he was convicted demonstrated his lack of regard for the health and safety of others when those interests were in competition with the fulfillment of his own personal desires, then there was no abuse of discretion in the court’s imposition of a fixed seven-year sentence followed by eight years indeterminate.

      § 39-609. Declaration of policy.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature hereby declares that infection with human immunodeficiency virus, the virus which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an infectious and communicable disease that endangers the population of this state. The legislature further declares that reporting of HIV infection to public health officials is essential to enable a better understanding of the disease, the scope of exposure, the impact on the community, and the means of control and that efforts to control the disease should include public education, counseling, and voluntary testing and that restrictive enforcement measures should be used only when necessary to protect the public health. It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that an effective program of preventing AIDS must maintain the confidentiality of patient information and restrict the use of such information solely to public health requirements. This confidentiality is essential so that infected persons are encouraged to reveal their condition to persons who have a legitimate need to know in order that they may assist the patient. Conversely, there is a need for certain individuals to know of the patient’s condition so that they may be protected from the disease or protect themselves and others closely associated with them or with the patient. The legislature believes that the balancing of the need to know by certain individuals in relationship to the need to maintain confidentiality to encourage reporting is essential to control the spread of the disease. This balancing cannot be fully codified in statutory law and must be left to the judgment and discretion of public health officials. If in the judgment of public health authorities an imminent danger to the public health exists due to an individual having a disease enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code, public health authorities shall take such action as is authorized in this chapter and as is necessary to prevent danger to the public health. Persons who have a legitimate need to know may include health care personnel, doctors, nurses, dentists, persons providing emergency medical services, morticians, lab technicians and school authorities. This is not intended to limit the usual and customary exchange of information between health care providers.

     <p>
      It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state to insure that children of this state shall receive adequate substitute parental care in the event of absence, temporary or permanent inability of parents to provide care and protection for their children or the parents are seeking alternative twenty-four (24) hour long-term care for their children. This policy is predicated upon the fact that children are vulnerable, not capable of protecting themselves, and when their parents for any reason have relinquished their care to others, there arises the possibility of certain risks to the children’s lives, health and safety which the community as a whole must protect against. This requires the offsetting statutory protection of review and, in certain instances, licensing or registration.

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 1990, ch. 215 read: “It is the intent of the legislature of the state of Idaho that the existing law governing child care facilities in chapter 12, title 39, Idaho Code, should be amended to clarify the different types of facilities in Idaho which provide twenty-four (24) hour child care for children in lieu of parental care. Since the enactment of the original language in this chapter in 1965 [1963], many different types of child care facilities have opened in Idaho providing a wide range of services for children but creating uncertainties whether they are or are not covered by the provisions of this chapter. Also, the Idaho legislature has enacted a separate law governing day care facilities for children. Therefore, it is timely to clarify how to categorize different child care providers, to identify which care providers are covered by this chapter and to assure that the provisions of this chapter do not and cannot be interpreted to apply to day care facilities, day schools, or to any type of home schools.”

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1980 acts, chapter 159, approved March 25, 1980, effective July 1, 1980, and chapter 325 approved April 2, 1980, effective April 2, 1980. The amendment of the first sentence by each chapter was not compatible with the amendment by the other. Therefore the amendment of the first sentence by each act has been compiled followed by its history. Chapter 159 substituted the sentence compiled above for a former first sentence which read: “The licensing agency with the advice of the advisory hospital council, hereinafter created, shall adopt, amend, promulgate and enforce such rules, regulations and standards with respect to all hospitals or different types of hospitals to be licensed hereunder as may be designed to further the accomplishment of the purposes of this law in promoting safe and adequate treatment of individuals in hospitals in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare.” Chapter 325 amended such sentence by substituting “board of health and welfare” for “licensing agency” at the beginning of the sentence. It should be noted that the amendment by chapter 325 still contains a reference to the “advisory hospital council.” The laws creating such council and defining its functions (§§ 39-1310, 39-1311) were repealed by S.L. 1980, ch. 159, § 12. Chapter 159 also amended the second sentence by substituting “facility or agency as defined” for “or institution.” Chapter 325 made no other changes.
    The 2020 amendment, by ch. 265, added the second sentence in the second paragraph.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Immediately after any election for voting upon the organization of a hospital district, the judges of said election shall certify the official results of said election to the clerk of said board of commissioners. The said board of commissioners shall, at its next regular meeting, proceed to canvass the votes cast at such election, and if upon such canvass it shall appear that one half (½) or more of the votes cast at such election are “. . . . hospital district, no.”, then a record of that fact shall be duly entered upon the minutes of said board, and all proceedings in regard to the organization of said district shall be void. If it shall appear, upon such canvass, that more than one half (½) of the votes cast at such election are “. . . . hospital district, yes.”, the said board shall by order entered on its minutes, declare such territory duly organized as a hospital district under the name designated in the petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an order be entered establishing the district, such order shall be deemed final and no appeal or writ of error shall lie therefrom, and the entry of such order shall finally and exclusively establish the regular organization of the said district against all persons, except the state of Idaho in an action in the nature of a writ of quo warranto commenced by the attorney general within thirty (30) days after the date of said order declaring such district organized, as herein provided, and not otherwise. The organization of said district shall not be directly or collaterally questioned in any suit, action or proceeding except as herein expressly authorized.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said board shall cause one (1) copy of such order duly certified to be immediately filed for record in the office of the county recorder in the county in which such district is situated and shall transmit to the governor one (1) certified copy thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      From and after the date of such filing of said order of the board of county commissioners, declaring such territory duly organized as a hospital district, the organization of such district shall be completed, and thereupon the district shall be a governmental subdivision of the state of Idaho and a body corporate with all the powers of a public or quasi-municipal corporation.

        This section was amended by two 1995 acts, ch. 118, § 51, effective July 1, 1995, and ch. 154, § 1, effective July 1, 1995, which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together. However, the amendment by ch. 154, § 1, at the beginning of the first sentence of the third paragraph, substituted “Not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days before any such election,” for “Not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before any such elections,” but the amendment by ch. 118, § 51 deleted the above quoted phrase from the sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 118, § 51, in the first sentence of the first paragraph, substituted “first Tuesday” for “second Tuesday”; in the first sentence of the third paragraph, deleted “Not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before any such elections” from the beginning of the sentence, substituted “Nominations” for “nominations” and in the middle of the first sentence of the third paragraph, inserted “not later than the sixth Friday preceding the election for which the nomination is made” and added the fourth paragraph.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1995 amendment, by ch. 154, § 1, in the first sentence of the first paragraph, substituted “first Tuesday” for “second Tuesday,” added the last sentence of the first paragraph, and in the first sentence of the third paragraph, substituted “thirty (30) days” for “30 days” and substituted “sixty (60) days” for “60 days.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 341, in the first paragraph, twice substituted “the third Tuesday of May” for “the first Tuesday of February” and substituted “in the next odd-numbered calendar year” for “in the second calendar year,” and deleted the last sentence, which read: “Prior to January 1, 1997, a board may, by resolution adopted at a regular meeting of the board, designate the fourth Tuesday in May as the election date of the district”; and in the third paragraph, in the second sentence, twice substituted “county clerk” for “board” and for “secretary of the district,” and in the third sentence, added “of county commissioners.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 11, deleted the former first sentence of the third paragraph which read: “Nominations may be filed with the secretary of the board not later than the sixth Friday preceding the election for which the nomination is made, and if a nominee does not withdraw his name before the first publication of the notice of election, his name shall be placed on the ballot”; and added the fifth paragraph followed by paragraphs (a) to (f).

      § 39-1333. Levy and collection of taxes — Initial financing.
     </h3>
     <p>
      To levy and collect taxes, as herein provided, the board shall, in each year, determine the amount of money necessary to be raised by taxation, taking into consideration other sources of revenue of the district, and shall fix a rate of levy, which when levied upon every dollar of assessed valuation of taxable property within the district, and with other revenues, will raise the amount required by the district annually to supply funds to pay for expenses of organization, purchase of necessary equipment, operation, maintenance and upkeep of the works and equipment of the district, provided, however, that said levy shall not exceed six hundredths percent (.06%) of market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the district for the purposes hereinbefore set forth, and provided further, that no levy shall be made in excess of four hundredths percent (.04%) of market value for assessment purposes for the purposes set forth in this section, unless the board of trustees of the district shall grant a public hearing, after notice of the time, place and purpose of said hearing has been published in a newspaper of general circulation in the district. Provided, that in the first year after organization, the board of a district may, for the purpose of organization, to finance general preliminary expenses of the district or for any other purpose of the hospital district law, and before making a tax levy, incur an indebtedness not exceeding in the aggregate a sum equal to three tenths percent (.3%) of market value for assessment purposes of all real and personal property within the district. To repay any such organizational indebtedness incurred, on or after March 21, 1985, the board shall have authority to levy and collect an additional tax not to exceed one tenth percent (.1%) of market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the district. Such additional levy shall not be used for any purpose other than repayment of the organizational indebtedness and interest thereon. Such additional levy may be imposed until the organizational indebtedness and interest thereon is paid in full.

       <p>
        This section does not demonstrate an intent by the legislature to let the district accumulate funds for future use. This section states that taxes are to be raised “annually to supply funds.” The wording of this section instructs the board of directors of a taxing district to prepare a budget for the coming fiscal year and then the board is allowed to levy a tax if it is necessary to supply funds for the coming fiscal year. It does not allow the placement of the funds in a capital improvement account. Idaho County Property Owners Ass’n v. Syringa Gen. Hosp. Dist., 119 Idaho 309, 805 P.2d 1233 (1991).

        A preliminary injunction would have been a proper remedy to prohibit a hospital district from placing levies it obtained pursuant to this section in a capital improvement fund or using the funds to help in renovation.

     <p>
      When there are two (2) or more hospital districts, which have at least one (1) common boundary, the boards of trustees of the hospital districts, meeting together, may determine that it is in the best interest of the qualified electors and prospective hospital patients that the boundary lines be adjusted or that the districts be consolidated, as herein provided.

      The boards of trustees shall jointly prepare a petition describing the boundaries of the existing hospital districts, the names of the existing hospital districts, and praying for the reorganization of the territory therein described as one (1) or more hospital districts to be known as the “.... hospital district or districts” and with boundaries as set forth in the petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall be signed by the chairpersons of the hospital boards upon majority approval of the respective boards involved in the boundary adjustment or consolidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall be forwarded to the clerk of the board of county commissioners in each of the counties affected who shall verify the signatures, and shall file the petition. Thereupon, the board of county commissioners in each of the counties affected shall proceed with the hearing and resolution as outlined in sections 39-1320, 39-1321 and 39-1322, Idaho Code, and an election in the manner required for the establishment of a hospital district.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the order granting the petition and adjusting the boundaries or establishing consolidation, the board of county commissioners in all counties affected shall certify the new boundaries and the name of the district or districts.

     <p>
      A copy of the order shall be transmitted to the board of trustees of the hospital districts involved.

      Such other notices as may be required by law shall be filed by the board of trustees of the district, including a legal description and map of altered boundaries to be filed with the state tax commission within ten (10) days of the effective date of the change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following boundary adjustment, the board of county commissioners within five (5) days shall take action to reaffirm members of the board of trustees, or to appoint members of the board or boards, who shall be chosen from the members of the boards initiating the boundary adjustment to the extent possible. These trustees shall serve until the next annual election of trustees or until their successors are elected and qualified as provided in section 39-1326, Idaho Code. The board or boards of trustees shall be sworn by a member of the board of county commissioners.

        The legislature meant for the phrase “or otherwise”, as used in the second paragraph of this section, to refer to “first aid services”; there is no indication based upon a review of the statutory heading that the legislature utilized in referring to this section, that the legislature intended for that phrase to refer to treatment rendered under an ordinary doctor/patient relationship, and such an interpretation of this section comports with<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t39c13s39-1391" target="_self">§§ 39-1391</a></cite>, 39-1391a and 39-1391b, wherein similar protection is given to hospitals rendering emergency treatment or first aid services.

        By bringing a lawsuit, a physician waives his or her right to assert the peer review privilege. The health care organization, and the members of its staff and committees who are defendants in the lawsuit, can then elect also to waive the privilege in order to defend the lawsuit. Verska v.

        Subsection (e) of this section merely provides that if a claimant makes inquiry, under subsection (b) of this section, for disclosure of the names of persons having direct knowledge concerning his case, he has consented to disclosure of such information to other parties; it did not entitle doctors defending malpractice action to disclosure of any of the records or minutes of a hospital tumor board meeting nor permit them to present evidence at trial that the board recommended that the plaintiff patient undergo an operation.

        Order of court which held inadmissible all records and minutes of hospital tumor board meeting at which defendant physicians sought and received opinion of board concerning recommended treatment of plaintiff in malpractice action, and which, in addition, held all testimony relating to such meeting to be inadmissible, was proper; however, since it would be unfair to prevent the physicians from showing that they had consulted with the board while allowing the plaintiff to argue that physicians had failed to comply with local standard of care by not seeking a second opinion before operating, an order must be entered to prevent the plaintiff from so arguing.

        Where a patient whose care was the subject of discussion by a hospital tumor board filed a lawsuit against the board on account of its “activity,” i.e., its alleged recommendation that surgery be performed, and also filed suit against two doctors, who were being sued not “on account of” any activity of the tumor board but because of the alleged negligence of the doctors independent from any board activity, that part of the suit which was directed against the doctors did not activate the waiver provisions of subsection (f) and did not provide a basis for the doctors to compel disclosure of the board’s records.

      § 39-1395. Practice of podiatry — Medical staff membership.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this section, no provision or provisions of this section shall in any way change or modify the authority or power of the governing body of any hospital to make such rules, standards or qualifications for medical staff membership as they, in their discretion, may deem necessary or advisable, or to grant or refuse membership on a medical staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      An applicant for medical staff membership may not be denied membership solely on the ground that the applicant holds a license to practice podiatry issued by the Idaho state board of podiatry. The criteria utilized for granting medical staff membership shall be reasonable and shall not discriminate against podiatry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The process for considering applications for medical staff membership and privileges shall afford each applicant due process.
     </p>
     <p>
      All applications for medical staff membership shall be acted upon within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the required information is submitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The accordance and delineation of clinical privileges for podiatrists shall be determined on an individual basis and commensurate with the applicant’s education, training, experience and demonstrated competence. In implementing these procedures, each hospital shall formulate and apply reasonable standards that do not discriminate in the evaluation of an applicant’s credentials.
     </p>
     <p>
      A member of the medical staff licensed pursuant to chapter 18, title 54, Idaho Code, shall have responsibility for the overall medical care of the patient while in the hospital. Arrangements for the services of a member of the medical staff licensed pursuant to chapter 18, title 54, Idaho Code, for the purposes of this section shall be the sole responsibility of the admitting podiatrist and not that of the hospital or any other member of the medical staff.

     <p>
      It is hereby determined and declared that for the benefit of the people of the state of Idaho and the improvement of their health, welfare and living conditions, it is essential that the people of this state have adequate medical care and health facilities; that it is essential that health institutions within the state be provided with appropriate additional means to assist in the development and maintenance of public health, health care, hospitals and related facilities; that it is the purpose of this act to provide a measure of assistance and alternative methods to enable health institutions in the state to refund or refinance outstanding indebtedness incurred for health facilities and to provide additional facilities and structures which are sorely needed to accomplish the purposes of this act, all to the public benefit and good as more fully provided herein; and it is the intent of the legislature by the passage of this act to create the Idaho health facilities authority to lend money to health institutions and to authorize the authority to acquire, construct, reconstruct, repair, alter, improve, extend, own, lease and dispose of properties to the end that the authority may be able to promote the health and welfare of the people of this state and to vest such authority with all powers to enable such authority to accomplish such purpose; it is not intended by this act that the authority shall itself be authorized to operate any such health facility. This act shall be liberally construed to accomplish the intentions expressed herein.

      There is hereby created an independent public body politic and corporate to be known as the “Idaho health facilities authority.” Said authority is constituted a public instrumentality and the exercise by the authority of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be the performance of an essential public function.

Not more than four (4) of said seven (7) members of the authority shall be of the same political party. At least one (1) of the members to be appointed by the governor shall be or shall have been a trustee, director, comptroller or other employee of a public or not for profit hospital knowledgeable in hospital and health care construction and financing. At least one (1) such appointed member shall be a person experienced in and having a favorable reputation for skill, knowledge and experience in the field of state and municipal finance. At least one (1) of such appointed members shall be a person experienced in and having a favorable reputation for skill, knowledge and experience in the field of health facility architecture. In making appointments the governor shall take into consideration nominees recommended to him for appointment by professional organizations of hospitals, long term care facilities, investment banking and architects. The members of the authority first appointed by the governor shall serve for terms to be designated by the governor expiring on June 30, as follows: two (2) in 1973 and 1974 and one (1) each in 1975, 1976, and 1977, respectively. Upon the expiration of the term of any appointed member his successor shall be appointed for a term of five (5) years and until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. Any member shall be eligible for reappointment. The governor shall fill any vacancy for the remainder of any unexpired term. Any member of the authority may be removed by the governor for misfeasance, malfeasance or willful neglect of duty or other cause after notice and a public hearing unless such notice or hearing shall be expressly waived in writing.

        Since the health facility authority created by this section is a board appointed by the governor and cannot choose its own governing body, it is restricted to a narrow range of permissible public goals and a narrow means of achieving them, the authority is not a corporation within the meaning of Idaho Const., Art. III, § 19 or Idaho Const., Art. XI, § 2, but is a public body and its creation did not violate Idaho Const., Art. III, § 19, or Idaho Const., Art. XI, § 2. Board of County Comm’rs v.

      A member of the authority designated by the governor shall call and convene the initial organizational meeting of the authority and shall serve as its chairman pro tem. At such meeting appropriate by-laws shall be presented for adoption. The by-laws may provide for the election or appointment of officers and the delegation of certain powers and duties and such other matters as the authority deems proper.

It shall appoint an executive director or secretary and may appoint an associate executive director or associate secretary, who may but are not required to be members of the authority and who shall serve at its pleasure. They shall receive such compensation for special services as shall be fixed by the authority. The executive director or secretary or associate executive director or secretary, or other person designated by the authority, shall keep a record of the proceedings thereof and shall be custodian of all books, documents and papers filed with the authority, the minute books or journal thereof and its official seal. Said executive director or secretary or associate executive director or associate secretary or other person, may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the authority and may give certificates under the official seal of the authority to the effect that such copies are true copies and all persons dealing with the authority may rely on such certificates. The authority may delegate by resolution to one (1) or more of its members or to its executive director or secretary or associate executive director or associate secretary such powers and duties as it may deem proper. The executive director or secretary shall execute a surety bond in the penal sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or, in lieu thereof, the chairman of the authority shall execute a blanket bond covering each member, the executive director or secretary and the employees or other officers of the authority, each surety bond to be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office or offices covered, to be executed by a surety authorized to transact business in this state as surety. The cost of each such bond shall be paid by the authority. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary it shall not constitute a conflict of interest for a trustee, director, officer or employee of any health institution, financial institution, investment banking firm, brokerage firm, commercial bank or trust company, architecture firm, insurance company or any other firm, person or corporation to serve as a member of the authority, provided such trustee, director, officer or employee shall abstain from deliberation, action and vote by the authority in each instance where the business affiliation of any such trustee, director, officer or employee is involved.

      In the discretion of the authority any bonds issued under this act may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state of Idaho. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received or proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged and may convey or mortgage the project or any portion thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper, and not in violation of law, including particularly such provisions as have been specifically authorized to be included in any resolution or resolutions of the authority authorizing bonds thereof. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state, which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys, may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a facility.

Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such facility so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues or moneys available therefor, if any, to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the facility and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the payment of such cost has not otherwise been adequately provided for, to pay the principal of and the interest on outstanding bonds or notes of the authority issued in respect of such facility as the same shall become due and payable, and to create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such bonds or notes of the authority. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this state other than the authority. A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a facility, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds or notes of the authority or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds or notes as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement nor any other agreement nor any lease by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the authority. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund may be a fund for all such bonds or notes issued to finance facilities at a particular health institution without distinction or priority of one over another, provided the authority in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such sinking or other similar fund shall be the fund for a particular facility at a health institution and for the bonds issued to finance a particular facility and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of bonds having a subordinate lien in respect of the security herein authorized to other bonds of the authority, and, in such case, the authority may create separate sinking or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.

In addition to such initial fee, an “annual planning service fee” shall be paid to the authority by each participating health institution in an amount determined by the authority. Such annual planning service fee shall be paid on said dates or in installments as may be satisfactory to the authority. It is anticipated such fees shall be used for; (i) necessary expenses to determine the need of facilities in the area concerned and to that end the authority may utilize recognized voluntary and official health planning organizations and agencies at local, regional and state levels as well as the state statutory bodies having health planning responsibilities; (ii) necessary administrative expenses; and (iii) reserves for anticipated future expenses. In addition the authority may, for a negotiated fee, retain the services of any other public or private person, firm, partnership, association or corporation for the furnishing of services and data for use by the authority in determining the need and location of any such facilities for which application is being made or for such other services or surveys as the authority deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this act.

      The authority may invest the proceeds from the sale of a series of obligations or any funds related to the series in such securities and other investments, whether or not any such investment or reinvestment is authorized under any other law of the state, as may be provided in the proceedings under which the series of obligations are authorized to be issued. The authority may invest any other funds in obligations of the federal government, the state or of any municipality thereof or obligations of agencies of the federal government; in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, treasury bills or other securities constituting direct obligations of the United States of America; in certificates of deposit or time deposits constituting direct obligations of any bank in Idaho; provided, however, that investments may be made only in those certificates of deposit or time deposits in banks which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation, if then in existence, and may exceed the maximum of such insurance; or in short term discount obligations of the federal national mortgage association. Any such securities may be purchased at the offering or market price thereof at the time of such purchase. The authority may invest any other funds with such maturities as the authority shall determine provided that such maturities are on a date or dates prior to the time when, in the judgment of the authority, the funds so invested will be required for expenditure. The express judgment of the authority as to the time when any such funds will be required for expenditure or be redeemable is final and conclusive.

      The legislative intent of this chapter is to protect the public health by establishing standards and provisions for the regulation of food establishments; by delegating authority to the board of health and welfare to adopt rules covering the health and sanitation aspects of food establishments, to collect a fee to cover a portion of the cost of the food safety inspection program and by delegating the authority to the director of the department of health and welfare to enforce the provisions of this chapter. This chapter is enacted to ensure that consumers are not exposed to adverse health conditions arising out of the operation of food establishments.

      No person, firm or corporation shall operate a food establishment, for which no other state or federal food safety inspection or license is required, without a license approved by the director of the department of health and welfare or his designee. Food establishment licenses shall not be transferable and the type of license and any restrictions will be specified on the license. Terms and conditions of licensure are to be established by rules in accordance with the intent of this chapter. Any applicant or license holder aggrieved by an action of the regulatory authority which results in denial, suspension, or revocation of a license has the right to a hearing conducted pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and appeal shall be provided therein.

      The hotelkeeper shall retain such baggage and other property upon which he has a lien as provided in section 39-1806, Idaho Code, for a period of thirty (30) days.

Before denial or revocation is final, the department shall provide opportunity for a hearing at which time the owner or sponsor of an agency may appear and show cause why the license should not be denied or revoked. The board shall provide by rule and regulation a procedure whereby a waiver of a specific rule, regulation or standard may be granted in the event that good cause is shown for such a waiver and providing that said waiver does not endanger the health, safety or rights of any patient. The decision to grant a waiver shall not be considered as precedent or be given any force or effect in any other proceeding. Said waiver may be renewed annually if sufficient written justification is presented to the department.

      Each party state hereby agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state. Such practices shall include:
    (1) Maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state;
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) Periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities thereon;

      (4) Assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities, and appropriate enforcement action taken for violations;

     <p>
      (5) After receiving notification from a host state that a generator within the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation standards, the party state will take appropriate action to assure that such violations do not recur. Such action may include inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by that generator.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit any party state’s authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this article.

Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as such action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states.

     <p>
      It is the policy of this state to provide treatment services for its citizens living with mental illness and/or substance use disorder, acknowledging that these illnesses cause intense human suffering and severe social and economic loss to the state. Recognizing that there is insufficient funding to meet the many needs of Idahoans with behavioral health disorders, it is critical that the behavioral health system efficiently use existing and future resources and increase accountability for services and funding. Additionally, the system needs to distinguish between and accommodate for the difference in the treatment and support services for children, youth, adults and the transitions between them. Regional behavioral health services, providing early and appropriate diagnosis and treatment, have proven to be effective in reducing the adverse impact of these disorders and valuable in creating the possibility of recovery. Families play a key role in the successful treatment of behavioral health disorders and provision of services. Participation by consumers and their families in system governance is critical to ensure ongoing system improvements. Acknowledging the policy of the state to provide behavioral health services to all citizens in need of such care, it is the purpose of this chapter to delegate to the state behavioral health authority the responsibility and authority to establish and maintain regional behavioral health services in order to extend appropriate mental health and substance use disorder treatment services to its citizens within all regions of the state.

      Recognizing both the need of every citizen to receive the best behavioral health services that the state is able to provide within budgetary confines and the disproportionate ability of counties to finance behavioral health services, the state behavioral health authority shall designate regions and be responsible for establishing regional behavioral health centers for all areas of the state.

However, the regional behavioral health boards shall have no authority to levy taxes. For the purposes of section 59-1302(15), Idaho Code, the seven (7) regional behavioral health boards created pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed governmental entities. The regional behavioral health boards are authorized to provide the community family support and recovery support services identified in section 39-3135(7), Idaho Code. The services identified in section 39-3135(7), Idaho Code, shall not be construed to restrict the services of the regional behavioral health board solely to these categories.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of a residential care or assisted living facility in Idaho is to provide a humane, safe, and homelike living arrangement for adults who need some assistance with activities of daily living and personal care but do not require the level of care identified under section 39-1301(b), Idaho Code, other than for short exceptional stays meaning a treatment window designed to allow a resident to receive treatment for a short term acute episode as determined by a licensed professional nurse.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state will encourage the development of facilities tailored to the needs of individual populations which operate in integrated settings in communities where sufficient supportive services exist to provide the resident, if appropriate, an opportunity to work and be involved in recreation and education opportunities. Employment, recreational and educational opportunities for people with disabilities shall be offered in the most integrated setting consistent with their needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      A residential care or assisted living facility shall be operated and staffed by individuals who have the knowledge and experience required to provide safe and appropriate services to all residents of the facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      The administrator of the facility shall ensure that an objective, individualized assessment to determine resident needs is conducted, develop a comprehensive negotiated plan of care to meet those needs, deliver appropriate services to meet resident needs, and ensure resident rights are honored.

      The state will foster the development of, and provide incentives for, residential care or assisted living facilities serving specific mentally ill and developmentally or physically disabled populations which are small in size to provide for family and homelike arrangements. Small facilities of eight (8) beds or less for individuals with developmental or physical disabilities or dementia and fifteen (15) beds or less for individual with mental illness will provide residents with the opportunity for normalized and integrated living in typical homes in neighborhoods and communities.

    <p>
     As of January, 2006 there were over 92,000 individuals on the waiting list for organ transplantation, and the list keeps growing. It is estimated that approximately 5,000 individuals join the waiting list each year.

     . Every hour another person in the United States dies because of the lack of an organ to provide a life saving organ transplant.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lack of organs results from the lack of organ donors. For example, according to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients in 2005 when there were about 90,000 people on the organ transplant waiting list, there were 13,091 individuals who died under the age of 70 using cardiac and brain death criteria and who were eligible to be organ donors. Of these, only 58% or 7,593 were actual donors who provided just over 23,000 organs. Living donors, primarily of kidneys, contributed about 6,800 more organs. Between them about 28,000 organs were transplanted into patients on the waiting list in 2005. (
    See
     <span class="s1">
      www.optn.org
     </span>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     The 2005 data on cadaveric organ donors suggests there were 5,498 individuals who died that year that could have been donors who weren’t and that had they been organ donors there would have been approximately 17,000 additional organs potentially available for transplantation. (
    See generally
    ,
     <span class="s1">
      www.unos.org
     </span>
     and
     <span class="s1">
      www.ustransplant.org
     </span>
     ). However, these numbers to some extent are only estimates. First, they exclude individuals dying over the age of 70. Second, the data are self reported for eligible donors. Indicative of the absence of precision in this area is the report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM). According to the IOM, it has been estimated that donor-eligible deaths range between 10,500 and 16,800 per year.
     See
     “Organ Donation: Opportunities for Action,” Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (2006) at page 27.
     <span class="s1">
      www.nap.edu
     </span>
     Using the 2005 figures for deceased organ donors, this would suggest that between approximately 3,000 and 9,000 decedents could have been donors but weren’t. Further, if one assumes an average of three solid organs recovered from each of them, there could be between 9,000 and 27,000 more organs that might have been available to transplant into individuals on the waiting list.
    </p>
    <p>
     The data for eye and tissue is, however, more encouraging. On an annual basis there are approximately 50,000 eye donors and tissue donors and over 1,000,000 ocular and tissue transplants.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (“UAGA”) is promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (“NCCUSL”) to address in part the critical organ shortage by providing additional ways for making organ, eye, and tissue donations. The original UAGA was promulgated by NCCUSL in 1968 and promptly enacted by all states. In 1987, the UAGA was revised and updated, but only 26 states adopted that version. Since 1987, many states have adopted non-uniform amendments to their anatomical gift acts. The law among the various states is no longer uniform and harmonious, and the diversity of law is an impediment to transplantation. Furthermore the federal government has been increasingly active in the organ transplant process.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since 1987, there also have been substantial improvements in the technology and practice of organ, eye, and tissue transplantation and therapy. And, the need for organs, eyes, and tissue for research and education has increased to assure more successful transplantations and therapies. The improvements in technology and the growing needs of the research community have correspondingly increased the need for more donors.
    </p>
    <p>
     This 2006 Revised UAGA is promulgated with the substantial and active participation of the major stakeholders representing donors, recipients, doctors, procurement organizations, regulators, and others affected. The Drafting Committee held four meetings with the stakeholders beginning on Friday morning and ending Sunday noon, reading and discussing each section of the drafts word by word (Chicago, December 3-5, 2004; Philadelphia, March 18-20, 2005; Chicago, November 2-4, 2005; and Detroit, April 21-23, 2006). The following stakeholders were actively engaged in the dialogue working for a consensus that could and should be adopted on a uniform basis to facilitate the anatomical gifts of human bodies and parts: American Bar Association, American Medical Association, American Lung Association, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, American Association of Tissue Banks, Eye Bank Association of America, Health Law Institute and Center for Race and Bioethics, Life Alaska Donor Services, Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, National Association of Medical Examiners, National Disease Research Interchange, National Kidney Foundation, North American Transplant Coordinators Organization, RTI Donor Services, United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and United States Department of Health & Human Services. In addition, there were many who contributed their views and comments by correspondence, including the Funeral Consumers Alliance, Inc. and Funeral Ethics Organization.
    This [act] adheres to the significant policy determinations reflected in existing anatomical gift acts. First, the [act] is designed to encourage the making of anatomical gifts. Second, the [act] is designed to honor and respect the autonomy interest of individuals to make or not to make an anatomical gift of their body or parts. Third, the [act] preserves the current anatomical gift system founded upon altruism by requiring a positive affirmation of an intent to make a gift and prohibiting the sale and purchase of organs. This [act] includes a number of provisions, discussed below, that enhance these policies.

     History of 1968 and 1987 Acts
    </h5>
    <p>
     The first reported medical transplant occurred in the third century. However, medical miracles flowing from transplants are truly a modern story beginning in the first decade of the twentieth century with the first successful transplant of a cornea. But, not until three events occurred in the twentieth century, in addition to the development of surgical techniques to effectuate a transplant, could transplants become a viable option to save and meaningfully extend lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first event was the development in the late 1960s of the first set of neurological criteria for determining death. These criteria allowed persons to be declared dead upon the cessation of all brain activity. Ultimately these criteria, together with the historic measure of determining death by cessation of circulation and respiration, were incorporated into Section 1 of the Uniform Determination of Death Act providing that: “An individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory function, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The second event, following shortly after Dr. Christian Barnard’s successful transplant of a heart in November, 1967, was this Conference’s adoption of the first Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. In short order, every jurisdiction uniformly adopted the 1968 Act. The most significant contribution of the 1968 Act was to create a right to donate organs, eyes, and tissue. This right was not clearly recognized at common law. By creating this right, individuals became empowered to donate their parts or their loved one’s parts to save or improve the lives of others.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last event was the development of immunosuppressive drugs that prevented organ recipients from rejecting transplanted organs. This permitted many more successful organ transplants, thus contributing to the rapid growth in the demand for organs and the need for changes in the law to facilitate the making of anatomical gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1987, a revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act was promulgated to address changes in circumstances and in practice. Only 26 jurisdictions enacted the 1987 revision. Consequently, there is significant non-uniformity between states with the 1968 Act and those with the 1987 revisions. Neither of those acts comports with changes in federal law adopted subsequent to the 1987 Act relating to the role of hospitals and procurement organization in securing organs, eyes, and tissues for transplantation. And, both of them have impediments that are inconsistent with a policy to encourage donation.
    The two previous anatomical gift acts, as well as this [act], adhere to an “opt in” principle as its default rule. Thus, an individual becomes a donor only if the donor or someone acting on the donor’s behalf affirmatively makes an anatomical gift. The system universally adopted in this country is contrary to the system adopted in some countries, primarily in Europe, where an individual is deemed to be a donor unless the individual or another person acting on the individual’s behalf “opts out.” This other system is known as “presumed consent.” While there are proponents of presumed consent who believe the concept of presumed consent could receive in the future a favorable reception in this country, the professional consensus appears to be not to replace the present opt-in principle at this time.

     Scope of the 2006 Revised Act
    </h5>
    <p>
     This [act] is limited in scope to donations from deceased donors as a result of gifts made before or after their deaths. Although recently there has been a significant increase in so-called “living donations,” where a living donor immediately donates an organ (typically a kidney or a section of a liver) to a recipient, donations by living donors are not covered in this [act] because they raise distinct and difficult legal issues that are more appropriate for a separate act.
    </p>
    <p>
     A majority of donors or prospective donors are candidates for donation of eyes or tissue, but only a small percentage of individuals die under circumstances that permit an anatomical gift of an organ. To procure an anatomical gift for transplantation, therapy, research, or education, a donor or prospective donor must be declared dead (
    see
    Uniform Determination of Death Act). In cases of potential organ donation, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of an organ for transplantation or therapy are administered to a patient who is dead or near death to determine if the patient could be a prospective donor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pursuant to federal law, when a donor or a patient who could be a prospective donor is dead or near death, a procurement organization, or a designee, must be notified. The organization begins to develop a medical and social history to determine whether the dying or deceased individual’s body might be medically suitable for donation. If the body of a dying or deceased person might be medically suitable for donation, the procurement organization checks for evidence of a donation, if not otherwise known, and seeks consent to donation from authorized persons, if necessary. In the case of an organ, the organ procurement organization obtains from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (“OPTN”) a prioritized list of potential recipients from the national organ waiting list and takes the necessary steps to see that the organ finds its way to the appropriate recipient. If eye or tissue is donated, the appropriate procurement organization procures the eye or tissue and takes the necessary steps to screen, test, process, store, or distribute them as required for transplantation, therapy, research, or education. All must be done expeditiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Recent technological innovations have increased the types of organs that can be transplanted, the demand for organs, and the range of individuals who can donate or receive an organ, thereby increasing the number of organs available each year and the number of transplantations that occur each year. Nonetheless, the number of deaths for lack of available organs also has increased. While the Commissioners are under no illusion that any anatomical gift act can fully satisfy the need for organs, any change that could increase the supply of organs and thus save lies is an improvement.
    Transplantation occurs across state boundaries and requires speed and efficiency if the organ is to be successfully transplanted into a recipient. There simply is no time for researching and conforming to variations of the laws among the states. Thus, uniformity of state law is highly desirable. Furthermore, the decision to be a donor is a highly personal decision of great generosity and deserves the highest respect from the law. Because current state anatomical gift laws are out of harmony with both federal procurement and allocation policies and do not fully respect the autonomy interests of donors, there is a need to harmonize state law with federal policy as well as to improve the manner in which anatomical gifts can be made and respected.

     Summary of the Changes in the Revised Act
    </h5>
    <p>
     This revision retains the basic policy of the 1968 and 1987 anatomical gift acts by retaining and strengthening the “opt-in” system that honors the free choice of an individual to donate the individual’s organ (a process known in the organ transplant community as “first person consent” or “donor designation”). This revision also preserves the right of other persons to make an anatomical gift of a decedent’s organs if the decedent had not made a gift during life. And, it strengthens the right of an individual not to donate the individual’s organs by signing a refusal that also bars others from making a gift of the individual’s organs after the individual’s death. This revision:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li id="t39c33s39-3392-PREFATORYNOTEol11">
      Honors the choice of an individual to be or not to be a donor and strengthens the language barring others from overriding a donor’s decision to make an anatomical gift (Section 8 [§ 39-3408]);
     </li>
     <li id="t39c33s39-3392-PREFATORYNOTEol12">
      Facilitates donations by expanding the list of those who may make an anatomical gift for another individual during that individual’s lifetime to include health-care agents and, under certain circumstances, parents or guardians (Section 4 [§ 39-3404]);
     </li>
     <li id="t39c33s39-3392-PREFATORYNOTEol13">
      Empowers a minor eligible under other law to apply for a driver’s license to be a donor (Section 4 [§ 39-3404]);
     </li>
     <li id="t39c33s39-3392-PREFATORYNOTEol14">
      Facilitates donations from a deceased individual who made no lifetime choice by adding to the list of persons who can make a gift of the deceased individual’s body or parts the following persons: the person who was acting as the decedent’s agent under a power of attorney for health care at the time of the decedent’s death, the decedent’s adult grandchildren, and an adult who exhibited special care and concern for the decedent (Section 9 [§ 39-3409]) and defines the meaning of “reasonably available” which is relevant to who can make an anatomical gift of a decedent’s body or parts (Section 2(23) [§ 39-3402(23)]);
     </li>
     <li id="t39c33s39-3392-PREFATORYNOTEol15">
      Permits an anatomical gift by any member of a class where there is more than one person in the class so long as no objections by other class members are known and, if an objection is known, permits a majority of the members of the class who are reasonably available to make the gift without having to take account of a known objection by any class member who is not reasonably available (Section 9 [§ 39-3409]);
     </li>
     <li id="t39c33s39-3392-PREFATORYNOTEol16">
      Creates numerous default rules for the interpretation of a document of gift that lacks specificity regarding either the persons to receive the gift or the purposes of the gift or both (Section 11 [§ 39-3412]);
    7.  Encourages and establishes standards for donor registries (Section 20 [§ 39-3421]);
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     8.  Enables procurement organizations to gain access to documents of gifts in donor registries, medical records, and the records of a state motor vehicle department (Sections 14 [§ 39-3415] and 20 [§ 39-3421]);
    </p>
    <p>
     9.  Resolves the tension between a health-care directive requesting the withholding or withdrawal of life support systems and anatomical gifts by permitting measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of organs for intended transplantation or therapy to be administered (Sections 14 [§ 39-3415] and 21 [§ 39-3422]);
    </p>
    <p>
     10.  Clarifies and expands the rules relating to cooperation and coordination between procurement organizations and coroners or medical examiners (Sections 22 [§ 39-3423] and 23 [not adopted in Idaho]);
    </p>
    <p>
     11.  Recognizes anatomical gifts made under the laws of other jurisdictions (Section 19 [§ 39-3420]); and
    </p>
    <p>
     12.  Updates the [act] to allow for electronic records and signatures (Section 25 [§ 39-3425]).
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition, Section 2 [§ 39-3402] provides a number of new definitions that are used in the substantive provisions of the [act] to clarify and expand the opportunities for anatomical gifts. These include: adult, agent, custodian, disinterested witness, donee, donor registry, driver’s license, eye bank, guardian, know, license, minor, organ procurement organization, parent, prospective donor, reasonably available, recipient, record, sign, tissue, tissue bank, and transplant hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 4 [§ 39-3404] authorizes individuals to make anatomical gifts of their bodies or parts. It also permits certain persons, other than donors, to make an anatomical gift on behalf of a donor during the donor’s lifetime. The expanded list includes agents acting under a health-care power of attorney or other record, parents of unemancipated minors, and guardians. The section also recognizes that it is appropriate that minors who can apply for a driver’s license be empowered to make anatomical gifts, but, under Section 8(g) [§ 39-3408(7)], either parent can revoke the gift if the minor dies under the age of 18.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 5 [§ 39-3405] recognizes that, since the adoption of the previous versions of this [act], some states and many private organizations have created donor registries for the purpose of making anatomical gifts. Thus, in addition to evidencing a gift on a donor card or driver’s license, this [act] allows for the making of anatomical gifts on donor registries. It also permits gifts to be made on state-issued identification cards and, under limited circumstances, to be made orally. Except for oral gifts, there is no witnessing requirement to make an anatomical gift.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 6 [§ 39-3406] permits anatomical gifts to be amended or revoked by the execution of a later-executed record or by inconsistent documents of gifts. It also permits revocation by destruction of a document of gift and, under limited circumstances, permits oral revocations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 7 [§ 39-3407] permits an individual to sign a refusal that bars all other persons from making an anatomical gift of the individual’s body or parts. A refusal generally can be made by a signed record, a will, or, under limited circumstances, orally. By permitting refusals, this [act] recognizes the autonomy interest of an individual either to be or not to be a donor. The section also recognizes that a refusal can be revoked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 8 [§ 39-3408] substantially strengthens the respect due a decision to make an anatomical gift. While the 1987 Act provided that a donor’s anatomical gift was irrevocable (except by the donor), until quite recently it had been a common practice for procurement organizations to seek affirmation of the gift from the donor’s family. This could result in unnecessary delays in the recovery of organs as well as a reversal of a donor’s donation decision. Section 8 [§ 39-3408] intentionally disempowers families from making or revoking anatomical gifts in contravention of a donor’s wishes. Thus, under the strengthened language of this [act], if a donor had made an anatomical gift, there is no reason to seek consent from the donor’s family as they have no right to give it legally.
    See
    Section 8(a) [§ 39-3408(1)]. Of course, that would not bar, nor should it bar, a procurement organization from advising the donor’s family of the donor’s express wishes, but that conversation should focus more on what procedures will be followed to carry out the donor’s wishes and on answering a family’s questions about the process rather than on seeking approval of the donation. A limited exception applies if the donor is a minor at the time of death. In this case, either parent may amend or revoke the donor’s anatomical gift.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 8(g) [§ 39-3408(7)].
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 8 [§ 39-3408] also recognizes that some decisions of a donor are inherently ambiguous, making it appropriate to adopt rules that favor the making of anatomical gifts. For example, a donor’s revocation of a gift of a part is not to be construed as a refusal for others to make gifts of other parts. Likewise, a donor’s gift of one part is not to be construed as a refusal that would bar others from making gifts of other parts absent an express, contrary intent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 9 [§ 39-3409] sets forth a prioritized list of classes of persons who can make an anatomical gift of a decedent’s body or part if the decedent was neither a donor nor had signed a refusal. The list is more expansive than under previous versions of this [act]. It includes persons acting as agents at the decedent’s death, adult grandchildren, and close friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 10 [§ 39-3410] deals with the manner of making, amending, or revoking an anatomical gift following the decedent’s death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 11 [§ 39-3412] deals with the passing of parts to named persons and more generally to eye banks, tissue banks, and organ procurement organizations. In part, the section is designed to harmonize this [act] with federal law, particularly with respect to organs donated for transplantation or therapy. The National Organ Transplant Act created the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (“OPTN”) to facilitate the nationwide, equitable distribution of organs. Currently, United Network Organ Sharing (“UNOS”) operates the OPTN under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. When an organ donor dies, the donor’s organs, barring the rare instance of a donation to a named individual, are recovered by the organ procurement organization for the service area in which the donor dies, as custodian of the organs, to be allocated by it either locally, regionally, or nationally in accordance with allocation policies established by the OPTN.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 11 [§ 39-3412] includes two important improvements to previous versions of this [act]. First, it creates a priority for transplantation or therapy over research or education when an anatomical gift is made for all four purposes in a document of gift that fails to establish a priority.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second, it specifies the person to whom a part passes when the document of gift merely expresses a “general intent” to be an “organ donor.” This type of general designation is common on a driver’s license. Under Section 11(f) [§ 39-3412(6)] a general statement of intent to be a donor results only in an anatomical gift of the donor’s eyes, tissues, and organs (not the whole body) for transplantation or therapy. Since a general statement of intent to be an organ donor does not result in the making of an anatomical gift of the whole body, or any part, for research or education, more specific language is required to make such a gift.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 11(b) [§ 39-3412(2)] provides that, if an anatomical gift of the decedent’s body or parts does not pass to a named person designated in a document of gift, it passes to a procurement organization typically for transplantation or therapy and possibly for research or education. Custody of a body or part that is the subject of an anatomical gift that cannot be used for any intended purpose passes to the “person under obligation to dispose of the body or parts.”
    See
    Section 11(i) [§ 39-3412(9)].
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 11(j) [§ 39-3412(10)] prohibits a person from accepting an anatomical gift if the person knows that the gift was not validly made. For this purpose, if a person knows that an anatomical gift was made on a document of gift, the person is deemed to know of a refusal to make a gift if the refusal is on the same document of gift.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lastly, Section 11(k) [§ 39-3412(11)] clarifies that nothing in this [act] affects the allocation of organs for transplantation or therapy except to the extent there has been a gift to a named recipient.
    See
    Section 11(a)(2) [§ 39-3412(1)(b)]. The allocation of organs is administered exclusively under policies of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
    </p>
    <p>
     In part, Section 14 [§ 39-3415] has been redrafted to accord with controlling federal law when applicable. The federal rules require hospitals to notify an organ procurement organization or third party designated by the organ procurement organization of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in the hospital to increase donation opportunity, and thus, transplantation.
    See
    42 CFR § 482.45 (Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Conditions of Participation: Identification of Potential Organ, Tissue, and Eye Donors and Transplant Hospitals’ Provision of Transplant-Related Data). The right of the procurement organization to inspect a patient’s medical records in Section 14(e) [§ 39-3415(5)] does not violate HIPAA.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    45 CFR § 164.512(h) (“A covered entity may use or disclose protected health information to organ procurement organizations or other entities engaged in the procurement, banking, or transplantation of cadaveric organs, eyes, or tissue for the purpose of facilitating organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplantation”). Section 14(c) [§ 39-3415(3)] permits measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of parts to be administered to a patient who is being evaluated to determine whether the patient has organs that are medically suitable for transplantation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 17 [§ 39-3418] and Section 18 [§ 39-3419] deal with liability and immunity, respectively. (Section 16 [§ 39-3417], dealing with the sale of parts, also provides for potential liabilities but is essentially the same as prior law). Section 17 [§ 39-3418] includes a new provision establishing criminal sanctions for falsifying the making, amending, or revoking of an anatomical gift. Section 18 [§ 39-3419], in substance, is the same as the 1987 Act providing immunity for “good faith” efforts to comply with this [act]. However, while the [act] contains no provisions relating to bad faith it is important to note that other laws of the state and federal governments may provide for further remedies and sanctions for bad faith, including those under regulatory rules, licensing requirements, Unfair and Deceptive Practices acts, and the common law.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 18(c) [§ 39-3419(3)] provides that in determining whether an individual has a right to make an anatomical gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409], a person, such as an organ procurement organization, may rely on the individual’s representation regarding the individual’s relationship to the donor or prospective donor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 19 [§ 39-3420] sets forth rules relating to the validity of documents of gift executed outside of the state while providing that any document of gift shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 20 [§ 39-3421] authorizes an appropriate state agency to establish or contract for the establishment of a donor registry. It also provides that a registry can be established without a state contract. While this [act] does not specify in great detail what could or should be on a donor registry, it does mandate minimum requirements for all registries. First, the registry must provide a database that allows a donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift to include in the registry a statement or symbol that the donor has made a gift. Second, at or near the death of a donor or prospective donor, the registry must be accessible to all procurement organizations to obtain information relevant to determine whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift. Lastly, the registry must be accessible on a twenty four hour, seven day a week basis.
    Section 21 [§ 39-3422] creates a default rule to adjust the tension that might exist between preserving organs to assure their medical suitability for transplantation or therapy and the expression of intent by a prospective donor in either a declaration or advance health-care directive not to have life prolonged by use of life support systems. The default rule under this [act] is that measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of an organ for transplantation or therapy may not be withheld or withdrawn from the prospective donor. A prospective donor could expressly provide otherwise in the declaration or advance health-care directive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 22 [§ 39-3423] and 23 [not adopted in Idaho] represent a complete revision of the relationship of the [coroner] [medical examiner] to the anatomical gift process. Previous versions of this [act] permitted the [coroner] [medical examiner], under limited circumstances, to make anatomical gifts of the eyes of a decedent in the [coroner’s] [medical examiner’s] possession. In light of a series of Section 1983 lawsuits in which the [coroner’s] [medical examiner’s] actions were held to violate the property rights of surviving family members,
    see, e.g.
    , Brotherton v. Cleveland, 923 F.2d 477 (6th Cir. 1991), the authority of the [coroner] [medical examiner] to make anatomical gifts was deleted from this [act]. Parts, with the rare exception discussed in the comments to Section 9 [§ 39-3409], can be recovered for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education from a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the [coroner] [medical examiner] only if there was an anatomical gift of those parts under Section 5 [§ 39-3405] or Section 10 [§ 39-3410] of this [act].
    </p>
    <p>
     This [act] includes a series of new provisions in Sections 22 [§ 39-3423] and 23 [not adopted in Idaho] relating to the relationship between the [coroner] [medical examiner] and procurement organizations. These provisions should encourage meaningful cooperation between these groups in hopes of increasing the number of anatomical gifts. Importantly, the section does not permit a [coroner] [medical examiner] to make an anatomical gift.

       </h5>
       <p>
        “Agent” (paragraph (2)) is an individual who, under certain circumstances, can make an anatomical gift on the principal’s behalf. An agent is empowered to make a gift if the agent is authorized by a power of attorney for health care to make health-care decisions on the principal’s behalf. Thus, this [act], independent of any other law, empowers an agent acting under a power of attorney for health care to make an anatomical gift on the principal’s behalf. It is unnecessary that states adopting this [act] amend their power of attorney for health care statutes to specifically empower agents to make anatomical gifts on behalf of principals. On the other hand, a state may choose to amend its health-care power of attorney statute in order that all of the agent’s powers, including the power to make an anatomical gift, are located and visible in one place setting forth the powers of a health-care agent. Even though this [act] enables an agent acting under a power of attorney for health care to make an anatomical gift, if the principal prohibits the agent from making an anatomical gift of the principal’s parts, the agent would have no authority to do so. See Section 4(2) [§ 39-3404(2)].
       </p>
       <p>
        An agent also may be designated by a record, other than a power of attorney for health care, which authorizes the agent to make an anatomical gift. This would permit a principal to empower one individual to make health-care decisions and another individual to make anatomical gift decisions. In light of the definition of record, this authority could be expressed in a financial power of attorney.

        “Anatomical gift” (paragraph (3)) means a gift that takes effect after the donor’s death. Thus, an “anatomical gift” does not include a gift of an organ from a living donor to a living recipient.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Decedent” (paragraph (4)) is defined as it was under prior versions of this [act] to include both stillborns and fetuses. A fetus, by definition, is not an embryo and nothing in this [act] allows for an anatomical gift of an embryo. Under other law fetuses can be used for research.
    See
    , 42 U.S. C. § 289g-1 & 289g-2; 42 CFR § 46.201.
       </p>
       <p>
        By including stillborns and fetuses in the definition of “decedent,” this [act] assures that stillborns and fetuses continue to receive the statutory protections conferred by this [act]; namely that their bodies or parts cannot be used for transplantation, therapy, research, or education without the same appropriate consents afforded other prospective donors. The definition of decedent does not broaden the scope of available transplant or research subjects or techniques. Although the needs of research and transplantation may have changed and expanded since the original 1968 Act was drafted, the scope of this [act] with regard to the definition of those who may be a source of an anatomical gift has neither changed nor expanded. By its terms, this [act] is silent on the issue of the use or donation of blastocytes and embryos, neither authorizing nor prohibiting their donation or use. Similarly, this [act] is silent on the nature of the research to be performed and provides no authorization or prohibition for somatic cell nuclear transfer or other specific research techniques. The complicated legal, scientific, moral, and ethical issues which may arise in the consideration of such research is, or should be, dealt with in separate statutes and policies. Thus, nothing in this [act] affects embryonic stem cell research. However, for jurisdictions that might prefer a more restrictive definition in the second sentence of the definition of “decedent,” the following language is suggested: “The term does not include a blastocyst, embryo, or fetus that is the subject of an induced abortion.”
    “Disinterested witness” (paragraph (5)) means a witness other than those listed in the paragraph. Under Sections 5 [§ 39-3405] and 6 [§ 39-3406] anatomical gifts may be made or revoked. Under Section 7 [§ 39-3407] a person may also make or revoke a refusal. In most circumstances these acts must be evidenced by a record. However, in limited circumstances they can be evidenced by oral statements to at least two adult witnesses. In those circumstances at least one of the witnesses must be a disinterested witness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Document of gift” (paragraph (6)) includes a donor card or any other record. It also includes a donor registry (paragraph (8)), a driver’s license (paragraph (9)), and an identification card (paragraph (13)). While a donor card is a record, the reference to donor cards had been specifically retained because of the wide acceptance of that concept in our culture. Prior versions of this [act] also expressly referred to a will in the definition of a document of gift. The omission in this [act] of a will in the definition of a document of gift does not mean a will is not a document of gift. Rather, the “will” is subsumed in the word “record.” Where there is a need in this [act] to specially treat wills as documents of gift, the will is singled out from other documents of gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        A statement or symbol on a driver’s license or donor registry is a document of gift; it is not merely an expression of intent to make a gift. Therefore, where there is such a statement or symbol, no other document of gift is necessary to evidence the making of an anatomical gift. Potential donors utilizing records other than a driver’s license or a donor registry to make an anatomical gift should be strongly encouraged to make their gifts on a driver’s license or donor registry, as gifts on a license or registry are more likely to be discovered when the donor is dead or near death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 5(b) [§ 39-3405(2)] a donor can make an anatomical gift by authorizing the persons who maintains a donor registry to include on the registry a statement or symbol that the donor has made an anatomical gift. By adding a “donor registry” as a device for making an anatomical gift, this [act] recognizes the increasing use of donor registries to make anatomical gifts. The use of donor registries was not contemplated when the previous versions of this act were adopted. Today, however, they have assumed increased importance and in time may come to dominate how anatomical gifts are made. While the format of donor registries differ, generally they allow for the making of an anatomical gift of one or more parts and permit that gift to be made over the internet. No known donor registry provides for a refusal to make an anatomical gift, and this [act] does not require that they do so. The person who maintains a donor registry may, if it chooses, follow up an electronic registration by sending the donor a card to sign. However, that is not legally required by this [act] to make an effective anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Donor” (paragraph (7)) means the individual whose body or part is the subject of an anatomical gift. Thus, an individual who signs a donor card or authorizes a symbol to be placed on a driver’s license or donor registry evidencing an anatomical gift is a donor even though the part donated will not be removed from the donor until the donor dies. Likewise, if the family of a decedent who did not make an anatomical gift during life donates a part of the decedent, that decedent is a donor. Thus, “donor” refers to a living individual who made an anatomical gift or on whose behalf an anatomical gift was made to take effect in the future. The term also includes a decedent whose body or part is the subject of an anatomical gift. Anatomical gifts by a donor, as well as amendments, revocations, and refusals, may preclude the ability of others to make or revoke anatomical gifts on behalf of the donor.
    See
    Sections 7 [§ 39-3407] and 8 [§ 39-3408].
       </p>
       <p>
        “Donor registry” (paragraph (8)) means a database containing records of anatomical gifts. The concept of the registry is new to this version of the anatomical gift act. Many states now have donor registries. Most of them are operated by private organizations, such as a procurement organization (paragraph (21)) while some are operated by the state. Section 20 [§ 39-3421] of this [act] authorizes states to either establish or contract for the establishment of a donor registry. Donor registries, like driver’s licenses, are very effective devices to record the making of an anatomical gift. The making of an anatomical gift by these devices assures that the evidence of a gift is always available, unlike the traditional donor card which can often be lost. Furthermore, they are easily accessible by procurement organizations.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Driver’s license” (paragraph (9)) includes both driver’s licenses for which adults qualify, as well as licenses or permits issued to minors whether denoted “temporary permit,” “permit,” or “learner’s permit,” or something else. State laws vary widely on how young an individual under the age of 18 can be to obtain a driver’s license. For example, it is not uncommon for a learner’s permit to be issued to a 16-year-old individual. And, in some states licenses or permits can be issued to 14-year-olds for the purpose of driving only certain types of motorized vehicles, such as farm equipment. The definition of “driver’s license” is broad enough to include all of these. Furthermore, under the definition, a condition, such as that the holder must be accompanied by an adult or the holder can drive only certain types of vehicles, does not prevent the license or permit from being considered a “driver’s license” under this [act].
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 4 [§ 39-3404] if a minor is of an age that the minor would be entitled to obtain a driver’s license, the minor can make an anatomical gift even though the minor does not actually apply for a license. Thus, a minor who could apply for a permit could make an anatomical gift by another means, such as a donor card or donor registry. Furthermore, if a minor acquires a license on which the minor has made an anatomical gift, the minor would not have to re-apply for a driver’s license when attaining age 18 for the gift to be effective.
       </p>
       <p>
        This [act], however, does not require that licenses provide space for a notation that the holder is a donor. That mandate, if it exists, is left to other law.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Guardian” (paragraph (11)) means any person judicially appointed to make decisions for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the ward. The intent is to exclude guardians ad litem or temporary guardians who would not have an expected long-term relationship to the ward.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Identification card” (paragraph (13)) means an identification card issued by the [state department of motor vehicles]. Some individuals desire an identification card rather than a driver’s license. These individuals could make an anatomical gift by authorizing a statement or symbol to be put on the card. While this [act] does not require that space be provided on the card for that purpose, it is anticipated that states will design these cards in ways to permit the making of an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Know” (paragraph (14)) means actual knowledge. Thus, it does not mean imputed knowledge. When imputed knowledge is relevant under any section of this [act], the section expressly so provides.
    See, e.g.
    , section 11(j).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Parent” (paragraph (17)) means a parent whose parental rights have not been terminated. An adopting parent is a parent. On the other hand, a stepparent or judicially appointed guardian not otherwise by law designated as the child’s parent is not a parent.
    “Part” (paragraph (18)) means organ, eye, or tissue. While this definition is shorter than the definition in the 1987 Act, it is functionally the same because all parts of the human body, including bones and fluids, are encompassed within the definition. The definition excludes the whole body.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Prospective donor” (paragraph (22)) means an individual who is dead or near death and has been determined to have one or more parts that could be medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research, or education. The term includes an individual who made an anatomical gift during life and, therefore, is a donor. The term also includes a non-donor individual at or near the time of death with parts that are medically suitable for donation who could become a donor if the individual’s family made an anatomical gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409]. The term does not include an individual who made a refusal as the refusal bars other persons from making an anatomical gift on that individual’s behalf.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Reasonably available” (paragraph (23)) is defined in a manner similar to that in the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act. A decision to make an anatomical gift, particularly of an organ, is extremely time sensitive. Life-saving organs may be forfeited if persons with a priority to make an anatomical gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] cannot be located. Physical presence, however, is not required to be “reasonably available.” An individual is “reasonably available” if the individual can be contacted without undue effort. Also, the concept assumes that an individual is willing to act in a timely manner to permit the successful recovery of organs. An individual who is unwilling to make a decision to either donate or refuse to donate in a timely manner is not considered to be “reasonably available.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Tissue” (paragraph (30)), as defined in this act, includes bone. The definition excludes blood unless donated for research or education. Blood is not obtained from deceased persons for purposes of transplantation or therapy. Furthermore, blood banks are not treated as tissue banks under other law. Accordingly, it is appropriate to exclude blood from the operation of this [act] except when donated for purposes of research or education.

        Structurally, this [act] includes within Sections 4 [§ 39-3404] through 8 [§ 39-3408] provisions that were included in Section 2 of the 1987 Act. Section 4 [§ 39-3404] relates to who may make an anatomical gift before a donor dies, Section 5 [§ 39-3405] to the manner in which an anatomical gift may be made, Section 6 [§ 39-3406] to the amending and revoking of an anatomical gift, Section 7 [§ 39-3407] to the refusal to make an anatomical gift, and Section 8 [§ 39-3408] to the effect of gifts, amendments, and revocations on the ability of others to make an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the predecessor acts, this [act] provides that an individual may make an anatomical gift of the individual’s body or part if the individual is an adult. This [act], however, expands prior law in a number of ways.
       </p>
       <p>
        In most states a minor, under limited circumstances, can apply for a driver’s license. The minor might wish to be a donor. As a policy matter, if the minor is old enough to drive a vehicle the minor should be old enough to make an anatomical gift. Thus, this [act] provides that a minor who could obtain a driver’s license is empowered to make an anatomical gift whether on a driver’s license or other document of gift. On the other hand, if the minor donor dies under the age of 18, it seems appropriate that the minor’s parents should be able to revoke the gift.
    See
    Section 8(g) [§ 39-3408(7)]. Because the minor’s parents cannot revoke the anatomical gift if the minor donor later dies over the age of 18, there is no necessity under this [act] for the minor donor to confirm that anatomical gift after reaching 18. Thus, in a state that provides that a license issued to a minor is good for five years and the minor applies for the license at age 17, the minor can make an anatomical gift on the driver’s license and need not reaffirm the gift for another five years. Furthermore, once the minor reaches age 18, the minor’s parents cannot revoke the gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 4 [§ 39-3404] expands prior law in other important respects. It permits anatomical gifts by an emancipated minor. The act does not define “emancipated minor,” although a common example would be a married minor. State laws vary regarding the definition of an emancipated minor. By not defining the phrase in this [act], the phrase is effectively defined by other law of the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 4 [§ 39-3404] expressly empowers an anatomical gift to be made on behalf of an individual by that individual’s agent or a parent, if that individual is an unemancipated minor, or by a guardian.
       </p>
       <p>
        An anatomical gift by an agent, parent, or guardian remains in effect until such time as amended or revoked by an agent, parent, or guardian, or by the donor on whose behalf the gift was made. For example, if a parent makes an anatomical gift for a minor and the parent does not revoke that gift before the minor reaches age 18 or becomes emancipated, the anatomical gift remains in effect until such time as it is altered by the donor or by the donor’s agent or guardian. While agents, parents, and guardians can make an anatomical gift, they can not sign a refusal under Section 7 [§ 39-3407] on their principal’s or ward’s behalf. A refusal can only be made by that individual whose part or body might otherwise have been the subject of an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        As noted in the comments to the definitions, an agent acting under a power of attorney for health care is authorized merely by that designation to make an anatomical gift on the principal’s behalf. If the principal does not wish to authorize the agent acting under a power of attorney for health care to make that decision, the power must include language to expressly negate that authority.
    See
    Section 4(2) [§ 39-3404(2)]. Conversely, if the agent is acting under another record, such as a financial power of attorney, the agent would be empowered to make an anatomical gift only if that authority was expressly conferred in the record.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 2(2)(B) [§ 39-3402(2)(b)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 4 [§ 39-3404] specifically delineates the four purposes for which an anatomical gift may be made, namely, transplantation, therapy, research or education. The terms “transplantation”, “therapy”, “research” and “education” are not defined in this [act]. Rather, they are defined by their common usage in the communities to which they apply. In general terms, transplantation refers to the removal and grafting of one individual’s body part into the body of another individual. Research is a process of testing and observing, the goal of which is to obtain generalizable knowledge, while therapy involves the processing and use of a donated part to develop and provide amelioration or treatment for a disease or condition. Education posits the use of the whole body or parts to teach medical professionals and others about human anatomy and its characteristics.

       <p>
        The execution formalities associated with the making of an anatomical gift generally remain the same as under the 1987 Act. However, in addition to the making of an anatomical gift by a donor card, will, or state-issued driver’s license, an anatomical gift can also be made on a state-issued identification card or a donor registry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 5(a) [§ 39-3405(1)] provides that a donor can make an anatomical gift by authorizing a statement or symbol to be imprinted on the donor’s driver’s license, in the donor’s will, or during a terminal illness or injury, orally to at least two adult witnesses, at least one of whom is disinterested. Only a donor can make a gift under Section 5(a) [§ 39-3405(1)]. A Section 5(a) [§ 39-3405(1)] gift cannot be made by an agent, parent, or guardian.
    Under Section 5(a)(2) [§ 39-3405(1)(b)] an anatomical gift can be made in a donor’s will. The section is silent regarding who must sign the will. Statutes of Wills generally require wills to be signed by the testator, and under certain circumstances, permit wills to be signed by another individual acting on behalf of the testator at the testator’s request and often in the testator’s presence.
    See
    Uniform Probate Code<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.02.html#t02c05s2-502" target="_blank">§ 2-502</a></cite>. Thus, an anatomical gift can be made by the will of a donor whether the will is signed by a donor or a third party acting at the donor’s request.
       </p>
       <p>
        Typically an anatomical gift of a part for transplantation or therapy is not made by a will. In fact, donors are ill-advised to make an anatomical gift by will as the terms of the will may not be known in sufficient time to allow for successful recovery of the gifted parts. Individuals who make an anatomical gift of their parts in a will for transplantation or therapy should make their wishes known by other means as well. On the other hand, some individuals donate their bodies to medical science for research or education, and they may do so by a will. Subsection (d) [(4)] provides that, if an anatomical gift is made by will, it takes effect at the donor’s death. The gift is valid even though the will is not probated or is declared invalid.
    See
    Section 5(d) [§ 39-3405(4)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a)(3) [(1)(c)] permits an oral gift by a terminally ill or injured donor if the donor’s communication is addressed to at least two adult witness, at least one of whom is a disinterested witness. This subsection is new to anatomical gift acts. The ability to make an oral gift parallels the ability to make oral revocations and refusals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 5(b) [§ 39-3405(2)] permits an anatomical gift by a signed donor card or other record. The card or record can be signed by any person (donor, agent, parent, or guardian) authorized to make an anatomical gift under Section 4 [§ 39-3404]. If the person making the gift is physically unable to sign the card or record, the record can be signed by another individual acting at the direction of the donor or other person making the gift. In this case, the record must be witnessed by at least two adult witnesses, at least one of whom is a disinterested witness. Furthermore, the record must state that it was signed and witnessed at the request of the donor or other person.
       </p>
       <p>
        A disinterested witness is a witness other than the spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandchild, grandparent, or guardian, of the individual who makes, amends, revokes, or refuses to make an anatomical gift, or another adult who exhibited special care and concern for that individual. A disinterested witness also does not include any person to whom an anatomical gift could pass under Section 11 [§ 39-3412].
    See
    Section 2(5) [§ 39-3402(5)]. For example, a terminally ill individual could make an anatomical gift by an oral communication to two unrelated neighbors or to one unrelated neighbor and one of the individual’s adult children, but not to the individual’s two adult children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 5(b) [§ 39-3405(2)] also permits any person (donor, agent, parent, or guardian) authorized to make an anatomical gift under Section 4 [§ 39-3404] to make that gift by authorizing that a statement or symbol indicating that the donor has made a gift be included on a donor registry. Donor registries were not contemplated by the prior versions of this [act]. Since the promulgation of those versions, numerous donor registries have been created under the auspices of states or private organizations. Over time donor registries may become the primary device by which anatomical gifts are made by donors.
    See
    Section 20 [§ 39-3421] (creation of donor registry).
    A decision was made in drafting this [act] not to include a specific form in the statute for the making of an anatomical gift. Rather, the drafting committee concluded that suggested forms consistent with this [act] be included in these comments. Three such forms follow:

       <p>
        Section 6 [§ 39-3406] largely mirrors the provisions in the prior acts. It applies to the amendment or revocation of an anatomical gift whether made by a donor or by another person acting on behalf of the donor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 6(a)(1) [(1)(a)], an anatomical gift can be revoked or amended by a record signed by the donor or the other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under Section 4 [§ 39-3404]. If the donor or other person is physically unable to sign a record amending or revoking an anatomical gift, the record may be signed by another individual acting at the direction of the donor or other person so long as the record is witnessed by at least two adult witnesses, at least one of whom is a disinterested witness. In this case, the record must state that it was signed and witnessed at the request of the donor or other person.
    Subsection (a)(2) [(1)(b)], borrowing from statutes dealing with the revocation of wills, contemplates revocations or amendments made by a later-executed document of gift either expressly or by inconsistency. For example, suppose a donor executes a will bequeathing her entire body to Medical School A for research or education. Later, the donor signs a document of gift donating a kidney for transplantation. Since the later-executed document of gift is only inconsistent with the prior document of gift to the extent of the donated kidney, the donor’s kidney would, if medically suitable, pass to the appropriate procurement organization, and the donor’s body without the kidney would pass to Medical School A.
    See
    Section 11 [§ 39-3412].
       </p>
       <p>
        A driver’s license that makes no provision for the making of an anatomical gift is not a document of gift because a document of gift is defined to be a donor card or other record “used to make an anatomical gift.”
    See
    Section 2(6) [§ 39-3402(6)]. Therefore, a later-issued driver’s license that is silent regarding the licensee’s intent to make an anatomical gift would not be inconsistent with a prior driver’s license on which the donor had made an anatomical gift. Thus, the gift on the prior license would still be effective. For donors using a driver’s license to make an anatomical gift, however, it is wise to always make the gift on the most current license as motor vehicle departments may have expunged information on a previously issued license from their electronic databases.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no requirement under this [act] that documents of gift be dated. A “dating requirement” was purposely omitted to avoid invalidating documents of gift written without the advice of counsel that may not have included a date. That purposeful omission could result in some proof issues if a question arises whether one document of gift revokes another by inconsistency. There is little evidence to suggest that this would be a problem, but should it arise, the matter would have to be resolved by resort to any competent evidence. If the evidence is not available, a presumption should arise that the document of gift with the most comprehensive gift controls given the policy of this [act] to favor the making of anatomical gifts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 6(c) [(3)] an anatomical gift made by a document of gift also can be revoked by destruction of the document of gift if the destruction is done with the intent to revoke that gift. As a practical matter revocation by destruction is not possible for anatomical gifts made on a donor registry. A donor wishing to revoke anatomical gifts made on a donor registry should revise the registry. If an anatomical gift was evidenced by a written document that was destroyed inadvertently and cannot be found, there may be no effective Section 4 [§ 39-3404] anatomical gift because no one may know of the anatomical gift. Inadvertent destruction of donor cards is common. A card may be lost when the donor decides to clean out a wallet or purse. Thus, donors are well advised to make their wishes known on documents of gift with greater permanency, such as a driver’s license or a donor registry, in order to reduce the risk of inadvertent destruction.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ability to revoke an anatomical gift is subject to the limitations in Section 8 [§ 39-3408]. For example, if a donor makes an anatomical gift of a kidney, all other persons are precluded from revoking that gift. Therefore, the donor’s later-appointed guardian would not be empowered to revoke that anatomical gift under Section 6 [this section].
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 6(d) [(4)] an anatomical gift may also be amended or revoked by a donor with a terminal illness or injury by any form of communication that is addressed to at least two adult witnesses, at least one of whom must be a disinterested witness. If the donor cannot communicate orally, acceptable forms of communication, in addition to a record, could include a movement of the head or eye in response to specific questions.

        Section 7 [this section] honors the autonomy of an individual whose body or part might otherwise be the subject of an anatomical gift by empowering the individual to make a refusal. There is no age limitation for an individual to sign a refusal. An individual of any age can do so. (However, if a minor has made a refusal and dies under the age of 18, the refusal can be revoked by the minor’s parents.
    See
    Section 8(h) [§ 39-3408(8)]).
       </p>
       <p>
        A refusal can only be made by the individual whose parts are the subject of the refusal. Thus, an individual’s agent, parent, or guardian cannot make a refusal for the individual under Section 7 [this section] even though the agent, parent, or guardian could have made a gift for the individual under Section 4 [§ 39-3404].
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusals typically are made by a signed record. If the individual who wants to sign a refusal cannot physically do so, the refusal can be signed by another individual acting at the request of the individual. If the refusal is signed by another individual acting at the request of the individual making the refusal, the refusal must be witnessed by at least two adults, at least one of whom is a disinterested witness. Furthermore, the record must state that it was signed and witnessed at the request of the individual.
    See
    Section 7(a)(1) and (b) [(1)(a) and (b)].
       </p>
       <p>
        A refusal can also be made by the individual’s will whether or not the will is admitted to probate or is later invalidated. Additionally, a refusal can be made by any form of communication by a terminally ill or injured individual addressed to at least two adults, at least one of whom is a disinterested witness.
    See
    Section 7(a)(3) [(1)(c)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) [(3)] provides for the amendment or revocation of a refusal. A refusal may be revoked by a signed record. It can also be revoked by a later-made anatomical gift that is inconsistent with the refusal. For example, suppose an individual signs a refusal to be an organ donor under Section 7 [this section]. Later that individual signs a record stating only “I revoke the refusal.” At this point that individual is neither a donor nor a refuser and upon the individual’s death, an anatomical gift could be made by the person or persons listed in Section 9 [§ 39-3409]. On the other hand, suppose the individual who had signed a refusal later executed a document of gift donating “my eyes.” Here there is an anatomical gift of the eyes and a refusal to be a donor of any other part. This would bar any person from revoking the anatomical gift of the eyes or making an anatomical gift of any other part. Similarly, suppose the individual had signed a refusal and later obtained a driver’s license stating that the individual wanted to be an “organ donor.” The driver’s license would revoke the refusal to the extent inconsistent with the refusal, and there would be an anatomical gift of the donor’s organs, eyes, and tissue.
    See
    Section 11(f) [§ 39-3412(6)]. Lastly, under limited circumstances, a refusal can be revoked orally.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 7(c)(1) [(3)(a)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (d) [(4)] provides that an individual’s unrevoked refusal to make an anatomical gift of the individual’s body or part bars all others from later making an anatomical gift of the body or part. Thus, suppose an individual signs an unrevoked Section 7 [this section] refusal. No other person before or after that individual’s death could make an anatomical gift for that individual. This section honors the autonomy of the individual to refuse to have his body or parts become the subject of an anatomical gift. It prevents families from making donations on behalf of decedents who, while living, had signed a refusal to make an anatomical gift unless there is evidence that the individual signing the refusal did not intend to have that refusal bind others after death.
       </p>
       <p>
        An individual might sign a Section 7 [this section] refusal that expressly provides that it is not intended to affect the ability of others to make an anatomical gift following the individual’s death. If that intent is expressly indicated in the refusal, or if the refusal were later revoked, then other persons listed in Section 9 [§ 39-3409] can make an anatomical gift. For example, suppose an individual signs a Section 7 [this section] refusal barring the making of an anatomical gift of the individual’s body and parts. If that person does not revoke the refusal, then neither that individual’s agent nor guardian nor any person listed in Section 9 [§ 39-3409] can make an anatomical gift of the individual’s body or parts. However, it is possible that an individual might wish to bar the individual’s guardian from making an anatomical gift under Section 5 [§ 39-3405] but not the individual’s family from making a gift under Section 10 [§ 39-3410]. If that intent is expressed in the refusal, it will be honored. The intent to make only a limited refusal must be set forth expressly in the Section 7 [this section] refusal. Extrinsic evidence would not be admissible to establish intent to limit the refusal as subsection (d) [(4)] provides that a contrary indication be expressly set forth in the refusal.
    An individual’s refusal could be limited to a part. For example, an individual might sign a refusal to donate the individual’s eyes. In the absence of an express, contrary indication, the refusal would not apply to the individual’s other parts. Thus, following the individual’s death, the persons listed in Section 9 [§ 39-3409] could make an anatomical gift of the individual’s other parts.
       </p>
       <p>
        A simple form of refusal under this [act] could provide:
       </p>
       <p>
        I, _______, refuse to make any anatomical gift of my body or any part.

       <p>
        Section 2(h) of the 1987 Act provided that “an anatomical gift that is not revoked by the donor before death is irrevocable and does not require the consent or concurrence of any person after the donor’s death.” The intent of that section was to assure donation finality for anatomical gifts made by donors prior to death. For many years, however, it was the practice, albeit now changing, for procurement organizations to seek permission from donor families before parts could be recovered from deceased donors. This practice, however, is inconsistent both with the 1987 Act and, more importantly, the respect due to donors who have made anatomical gifts during their lives. Furthermore, that practice could result in unnecessary delays in the recovery of organs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 8 [this section] is designed to state firmly the rule that a donor’s autonomous decision regarding the making of an anatomical gift is to be honored and implemented and is not subject to change by others. Section 8 [this section] not only continues the policy of making lifetime donations irrevocable but also is restated to take away from families the power, right, or authority to consent to, amend, or revoke donations made by donors during their lifetimes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 8 [this section] addresses the possible tension between a donor’s autonomous decision to be a donor with the interest of surviving family members to make that decision. It addresses this tension by favoring the decision of the donor over the desires of the family. Section 8(a) [(1)] strips surviving family members of at least one stick in a bundle of property rights they might otherwise have under state law — the right to make, amend, or revoke an anatomical gift of a body or part if the donor made an anatomical gift or an amendment of the gift of the body or part. This section does not affect property rights families might otherwise have in a decedent’s body under other law, such as the right to dispose of a decedent’s body after the part that was the subject of the anatomical gift has been recovered. In fact, language in Section 11(h) [§ 39-3412(9)] confirms the family’s right to dispose of the donor’s body after the donor’s parts have been recovered for transplantation, therapy, research, or education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 8(a) [(1)] provides that, if a donor has made an anatomical gift or has amended an anatomical gift, no other person can make, amend, or revoke that gift. For example, suppose a donor gifts the donor’s organs for transplantation. By virtue of Section 8(a) [(1)], no other person can amend or revoke that gift. In fact, because all other persons are barred from doing so, they have no legal authority or right to amend or revoke the anatomical gift. This section does not apply to bar the parents of an unemancipated minor donor who dies under the age of 18 from revoking the minor donor’s gift.
    See
    Section 8(g) [(7)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 8(a) [(1)] is subject to the provisions of subsection (f) [(6)]. Under subsection (f) [(6)] the donor’s gift of a part for one purpose does not preclude another person from expanding the gift to include another purpose under either Section 5 or 10 [§§ 39-3405 or 39-3410]. For example, suppose the donor signs a document of gift stating: “I give my kidney for transplantation.” Following the donor’s death, an individual listed in Section 9 [§ 39-3409] could expand that gift to include research in the event the kidney was not medically suitable for transplantation. The right to expand the purposes of the gift can be restricted by the donor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 8(b) [(2)] provides that the donor’s revocation of an anatomical gift (as distinguished from a refusal) bars no one from making an anatomical gift of the donor’s body or parts. The difference between Section 8(a) [(1)] and Section 8(b) [(2)] is that a revocation is an ambiguous act respecting the donor’s intention to bind others. A donor might want to bind others, but it is just as likely that a donor was ambivalent and was more than willing to leave the decision to donate to others. For example, suppose an individual who had donated a kidney by a donor card later destroys that card with the intent to revoke the anatomical gift. This revocation will not prevent another person acting under either Section 5 or 10 [§§ 39-3405 or 39-3410] from making an anatomical gift. A donor who wishes both to revoke and bind others not to make a gift must sign a refusal.
    Section 8(c) [(3)] provides that a gift or an amendment of a gift by a person other than the donor under Section 5 or 6 [§§ 39-3405 or 39-3406] bars other persons from making, amending, or revoking that gift under Section 10 [§ 39-3410] only. For example, suppose the guardian of an adult makes a gift on the adult’s behalf. At the adult’s later death, the adult’s surviving child could not amend or revoke that gift. On the other hand, suppose a donor’s agent makes a gift during the donor’s lifetime and later a guardian is appointed for the donor. The guardian would not be barred from amending that gift or revoking it. The difference is that the persons named in Section 4 [§ 39-3404] are viewed as the donor’s alter egos with power to control the donation decision up until the time of the donor’s death. Of course, the donor could also amend or revoke the agent’s gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 8(d) [(4)] if a person other than the donor revokes an anatomical gift under Section 6 [§ 39-3406], the revocation does not bar another person from making a gift under either Section 5 [§ 39-3405] or Section 10 [§ 39-3410]. For example, suppose the donor’s parent makes an anatomical gift. Twelve years later the donor’s agent revokes that gift under Section 6 [§ 39-3406]. (Section 8(c) [(3)] does not bar the agent from revoking the gift). Then, five years later a guardian is appointed for the principal. The guardian could make an anatomical gift for the principal under Section 5 [§ 39-3405] because Section 8(d) [(4)] does not bar the guardian from making the gift. Likewise, the revocation of an anatomical gift by an agent, parent, or guardian would not prevent the making of an anatomical gift under Section 10 [§ 39-3410]. For example, suppose an agent makes an anatomical gift for a donor which the agent revokes prior to the principal’s death. The principal takes no further action to effectuate the anatomical gift and dies survived by a spouse and predeceased by the agent. The spouse could make an anatomical gift under Section 10 [§ 39-3410] because the agent’s revocation of the anatomical gift does not prevent the spouse from making the anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 8(e) [(5)], consistent with prior law, provides that, absent express, contrary indications by the person making an anatomical gift, the gift of a part is neither a refusal to give other parts nor a limitation on the making of gifts of other parts. Thus, if a donor makes an anatomical gift of the donor’s kidney, this gift does not bar the donor’s family after the donor’s death from making a gift of the donor’s heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anatomical gifts can only be made for four purposes — transplantation, therapy, research or education.
    See
    Sections 4 and 9 [§§ 39-3404 and 39-3409]. Section 8(f) [(6)] provides that an anatomical gift of a part for one or more of the purposes of transplantation, therapy, research or education does not limit the ability to make a later gift of the part for other purposes by the donor or any other person under Section 5 or Section 10 [§ 39-3405 or<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t39c34s39-3410" target="_self">§ 39-3410</a></cite>]. For example, suppose a donor donates “all organs, eyes, and tissue for transplantation or therapy.” That gift would not bar a gift under Section 10 [§ 39-3410] of the organs, eyes, or tissue for research. The donor can bar an expansion of the gift’s purposes by an express contrary direction. For example a donor’s gift of “organs, eyes, and tissue only for transplantation” would bar others from expanding the purpose of the gift to include research.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 8(g) [(7)] permits either parent of an unemancipated minor donor who dies under the age of 18 to revoke that gift. This subsection applies only if the child dies under the age of 18. It does not empower the parent of a living minor to revoke that minor’s anatomical gift while the minor is living. In fact, Section 8(a) [(1)] would preclude the parent from revoking the minor child’s anatomical gift. A parent who does not wish the parent’s minor child to make an anatomical gift should communicate the parent’s desires to that child. Once the minor donor becomes an adult, neither parent has the right to revoke the gift.
    Under Section 8(h) [(8)] an unemancipated minor’s refusal can also be revoked by the minor’s parent if the minor dies under the age of 18. Like Section 8(g) [(7)], a minor’s refusal cannot be revoked by the minor’s parent while the minor is alive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Section 8(g) [(7)] and 8(h) [(8)] require the parent to be reasonably available to either revoke a gift or a refusal. If both parents are reasonably available, either one can revoke the gift or the refusal.

        Section 9(a) [(1)] empowers the persons listed in the section to make an anatomical gift of a decedent’s body or parts unless they are otherwise barred from doing so under Section 7 [§ 39-3407] or Section 8 [§ 39-3408]. Persons who can make an anatomical gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] often will be consulted whether they would be willing to make a gift when the prospective donor is near death.
    See also
    Section 10 [§ 39-3410], comment (last paragraph).
       </p>
       <p>
        The list of persons who can make an anatomical gift on behalf of a decedent is slightly expanded from prior law. This list now includes that individual who at the time of the decedent’s death was acting as an agent of the decedent, adult grandchildren of the decedent, and a close friend of the decedent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This [act] does not extend the agency relationship beyond a principal’s death. Under other law, an agent’s power under a power of attorney for health care or any other power terminates when the principal dies. But, under this [act] and assuming that the agent was neither barred under Section 8 [§ 39-3408] nor prohibited in the power of attorney for health care from making anatomical gifts, the person who had been acting as an agent at the time of the principal’s death (even though death terminated the agency relationship) has the first priority to make an anatomical gift on behalf of the deceased principal.

        Absent a donation by the decedent or the decedent’s former agent, other persons or classes of person are empowered to make an anatomical gift in the following order: spouse of the decedent; adult children of the decedent; parents of the decedent; adult siblings of the decedent; adult grandchildren of the decedent; grandparents of the decedent; an adult who exhibited “special care and concern for the decedent;” and the person who was acting as guardian of the decedent at the time of the decedent’s death. Lastly, “any other person having the authority to dispose of the decedent’s body” can make the decision if no other persons are reasonably available. In those states that recognize domestic partners, the addition of the domestic partner to Section 9(a)(2) [(1)(b)] would be warranted. In states that do not recognize domestic partners, individuals with domestic partners who wish to be donors should make an anatomical gift before death or designate their domestic partners as agents to give them the first priority under this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that an individual is concerned that the person named in Section 9 [this section] may not take adequate account of the individual’s personal preferences regarding anatomical gifts, the onus is on the individual to either make or bar the making of an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of any person listed in paragraphs (1) through (9) [(1)(a) through (i)] to make an anatomical gift, the gift can be made by “any other person having the authority to dispose of the decedent’s body.” This [act], like its predecessors, does not specify what person has the authority to dispose of a decedent’s body. Who that person is must be determined by law other than this [act]. One such person might be a coroner or medical examiner in possession of an unclaimed body who under law other than this [act] is authorized to dispose of the body after a certain period of time. Of course, in that case it is most unlikely that the decedent’s organs could be donated as they are not likely to be medically suitable for transplantation or therapy given the amount of time that likely will pass before it can be determined that no one else will claim the body. But, the decedent’s eyes or tissue might be medically suitable for donation. And, of course, the whole body could be the subject of an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) [(1)] permits any member of a class to make an anatomical gift. Under subsection (b) [(2)], however, a class member cannot make an anatomical gift if the class member, or the person to which the gift could pass under Section 11 [§ 39-3412], knows of any objection to the making of the gift by another member of the class. If an objection is known, the gift can only be made by a majority of the members of the same class who are reasonably available. If the class member wishing to make the gift is the only reasonably available member of the class, that class member alone can make the gift even though the class member knows of an objection by another class member who is not reasonably available. If more than one member of the class is reasonably available, the gift can be made only if a majority of them agree. To illustrate, suppose the decedent is survived by three children. The eldest, who is unaware of any objection by the other two, can make an anatomical gift. If, however, the eldest knows that one of the other siblings objects and that sibling is reasonably available, both must agree to make the gift if the third sibling is not reasonably available. If all three siblings are reasonably available, at least two would have to agree to make the gift.
    This section departs from both the 1968 Act which required children to act by a majority and the 1987 Act which barred a class member from making a gift (and the donee from accepting the gift) if there was a known objection by another member of the class.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule of subsection (b) [(2)] does not apply to adults who exhibited special care and concern for the decedent. If there is more than one such person, any one of them can make an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        A person cannot make an anatomical gift if, at the time of the decedent’s death, a person in a prior class is reasonably available to either make or object to the making of an anatomical gift.
    See
    Section 9(c) [(3)]. The assumption here is that a person in a prior class is reasonably available but has not yet been contacted by a procurement organization. For example, suppose only the decedent’s grandchildren are physically present at the hospital when the decedent dies, but the decedent’s children are able to be contacted. For purposes of this [act], the children are reasonably available and, therefore, the grandchildren who are at the hospital cannot make an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        As highlighted above, known objections by persons not reasonably available do not bar persons who are reasonably available from making an anatomical gift whether the objections are held by a person in a prior class or the same class. This is purposeful. The policy choice here is essentially that only persons who are reasonably available can make or object to the making of an anatomical gift. That is because the known objection of a person who is not reasonably available may be based upon faulty information about the effects of a gift or other concerns that could have been ameliorated had the person been reasonably available to discuss the matter with a procurement organization or others.
       </p>
       <p>
        The concept and definition of “reasonably available” is drawn from lessons learned in the drafting of the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act and borrows from the language in Section 1(14) of that act. The making of an anatomical gift following a decedent’s death is extremely time sensitive, and a decision to donate must be made within a relatively short period of time following death if the organs are to remain viable and human lives are to be saved. Reasonably available is not synonymous with physically present. The phrase (defined in Section 2 (23)) [§ 39-3402(23)] means able to be contacted without “undue effort and willing and able to act in a timely manner consistent with existing medical criteria necessary for the making of an anatomical gift.” Thus, a sibling who can be easily contacted by telephone is reasonably available. Section 14(g) [§ 39-3415(7)] imposes on procurement organizations an obligation to make a reasonable search for persons with a priority to make an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        An individual with a higher priority to make an anatomical gift may be unwilling to make a decision, preferring it be made by others. For example, a decedent’s spouse may be unwilling to make a decision to donate the decedent’s organs, preferring that any decision be made by the decedent’s children. Under this [act] the spouse, being unwilling to make a decision, is not reasonably available. There is some concern that an unwillingness to make a decision is equivalent to an objection and should have been treated as such under this [act]. But, this [act] reflects a judgment that the potential savings in human life justifies the position that the inability to express a decision is tantamount to not being available to make a decision. This policy choice was supported by the fact that procurement organizations are well-trained to work with family members when seeking an anatomical gift to distinguish between an objection and a true unwillingness to make a decision.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 10(a) [(1)] provides that an anatomical gift by a person authorized to make the gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] can be made by a document of gift that is signed by the person making the gift. The document of gift could be an e-mail. This might be a common form of a document of gift where the gift is made by a person named in Section 9 [§ 39-3409] who is reasonably available but not physically present at the hospital where the donor died to deal in person with the procurement organization.
       </p>
       <p>
        The person also may make the gift orally. An oral gift must be recorded or reduced to a record that is signed by the individual receiving the oral communication. For example, the decedent’s spouse might consent to a gift over the telephone at the request of a procurement organization. The individual to whom the gift was communicated should then note that gift in a signed record.
    In common with prior law, if a person makes an anatomical gift but there is a member of a prior class who becomes reasonably available, that member may revoke the gift.
    See
    Section 10(b)(2) [(2)(b)]. If more than one member of the prior class becomes reasonably available, then the gift can be revoked only if the majority of the members of the prior class agree to revoke the gift or if they are equally divided.
        See
        Section 10(b)(2) [(2)(b)]. For example, suppose an anatomical gift of a kidney is made by a parent of the decedent because none of the decedent’s children are reasonably available to make the gift. However, before an incision is made to remove the kidney from the donor’s body or invasive procedures have begun to prepare the recipient, a child of the decedent becomes reasonably available and purports to revoke the gift. If this child is the decedent’s only reasonably available child, the gift is revoked. If, on the other hand, two children become reasonably available, the gift is revoked only if they agree to revoke or they are equally divided whether to revoke. And, if three children become reasonably available, the gift is revoked if at least two of the three agree to revoke the gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a gift is made by a member of a more remote class, the gift can be amended by the members of the prior class who become reasonably available.
    See
    Section 10(b)(1) [(2)(a)]. If more than one member becomes reasonably available, the gift can be amended only if a majority of them agree.
        See
        Section 10(b)(1) [(2)(a)]. For example, a grandchild of the decedent makes an anatomical gift of the decedent’s kidneys for transplant. Any reasonably available child or, if more than one, a majority of them can amend the gift to provide that if the kidney is not medically suitable for transplant, it can be used for research. Amendments are not subject to subsection (c) [(3)] (requiring revocations to be made before the incision is made to remove a part from the body or before invasive procedures have begun to prepare the recipient) as amendments typically would involve extending the purpose of the gift rather than preventing the gift from being made at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        This [act] is silent regarding whether a Section 10 [this section] gift can be made while a donor or prospective donor is near death or whether the gift can only be made after the donor or prospective donor has died. This is purposeful in order to allow procurement organizations and the person having the priority to make an anatomical gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] some latitude as to when to sign a document of gift. Of course, no gift is effective unless the donor or prospective donor dies and at the time of death the person making the anatomical gift then had the priority to make the gift.

        Section 11 [this section] sets forth various rules to identify the person to which a part or body passes as the result of an anatomical gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 11(a)(1) [(1)(a)], an anatomical gift of a body for research or education can be made to a named organization. These gifts typically occur as the result of a whole body donation to a particular institution in the donor’s will or as the result of a prior arrangement between a donor and a particular research or educational institution.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Section 11(a)(2) [(1)(b)] permits a donation of a part to a named individual if the part is to be transplanted into that individual, such donations are exceedingly rare for at least two reasons. Only in rare circumstances would a donor, during the donor’s life, know of an individual who would need an organ, eye, or tissue that would be the subject of an anatomical gift and, similarly, decedent’s families are generally not likely to know the identity of such individuals. Furthermore, gifts to a named individual may not be medically suitable as the donor and recipient may have different blood types or other characteristics that make them incompatible.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a gift of a part is made to a named individual and it is later determined that the part cannot be transplanted into that individual, the part passes to the organ procurement organization as custodian under subsection (g) [(7) to allocate the organ in accordance with applicable organ allocation policies unless the person making the gift expressly provides to the contrary.
    See
    Section 11(b) [(2)].
    Gifts by donors before death and gifts by others after a donor’s death could specify both the parts that are the subject of the anatomical gift and the purposes of the gift. For example, a donor might make a gift of a kidney for transplantation or therapy. If a gift is made of one or more specific parts and specifies the purposes of the gift but does not name a person to whom the gift passes, then the gift passes to the appropriate eye bank if the gift is an eye and for the purpose of transplantation or therapy.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 11(c)(1) [(3)(a)]. If the gift is of tissue for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, it passes to the appropriate tissue bank, Section 11(c)(2) [(3)(b)], and if the gift is an organ for the purpose of transplantation or therapy it passes to the appropriate organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ, Section 11(c)(3) [(3)(c)]. A gift of a specific part for purposes of research or education passes to the appropriate eye bank, tissue bank, or organ procurement organization.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 11(c)(4) [(3)(d)].
    <i>
     See also
    </i>
    Section 5 [§ 39-3405] comments, for examples of forms.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some cases the person making the anatomical gift specifies that the gift can be used for transplantation, therapy, research, or education but these purposes are not set forth in the document of gift in any priority. For example, a donor might donate “my kidney for purposes of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.” Under Section 11(d) [(4)], the gift must first be used for transplantation or therapy if suitable for either of those purposes. If not suitable, the gift may be used for research or education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most gifts made by donors before death are made by a driver’s license or entry on a donor registry. If a donor’s gift does not specify the purpose of the gift, as would occur if the driver’s license indicated only that the donor was an “organ donor,” the gift is only of the donor’s parts (not the whole body), and the parts may be used only for transplantation or therapy.
    See
    Section 11(f) [(6)]. Likewise, if a gift of a part is made but the document of gift fails to specify the purpose of the gift or name a person to receive the gift, the part may be used only for transplantation or therapy.
        See
        Section 11(e) [(3)]. In either case, if the part is an eye, it passes to the appropriate eye bank, if tissue, it passes to the appropriate tissue bank, and if an organ, it passes to the appropriate organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ.
        See
        Section 11 (e), (f) and (g) [(5), (6) and (7)].
       </p>
       <p>
        If a gift made under Section 4 [§ 39-3404] is limited to transplantation or therapy by Section 11(e) or (f) [(5) or (6)], procurement organizations could approach persons with a priority to make gifts under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] to expand the purpose of the gift to include research or education and obtain their consent to use the gift for those purposes in the event the gift is unsuitable for transplantation or therapy.
    See
    Section 8(f) [§ 39-3408(6)].
       </p>
       <p>
        A statement on a document of gift that the donor is an “organ donor” is an anatomical gift and not merely evidence of intention to be a donor.
    See
    Section 11[(6)]. Thus, parts can be recovered from the donor without the need of a Section 10 [§ 39-3410] gift. Additionally, as an anatomical gift by the donor, surviving family members would be barred from revoking the gift.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 8 [§ 39-3408].
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this [act], when an organ passes to an organ procurement organization for purposes of transplantation or therapy, it passes to the organ procurement organization as a “custodian.”
    See
    Section 11(h) [(8)]. Under Section 274 of the National Organ Transplant Act in 1984, Congress created the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN).
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    , 42 CFR §§ 121 et seq. Among other things, the OPTN oversees the nationwide allocation of organs for transplantation. Currently, the OPTN contracts with the United Network Organ Sharing (“UNOS”), a non-profit corporation, to administer the nationwide allocation of organs for transplantation. UNOS, in turn, has agreements with numerous organ procurement organizations that have specific designated service areas. The organ procurement organizations have primary responsibility to evaluate the medical suitability of organs for transplantation, seek anatomical gifts under Section 10 [§ 39-3410] when the decedent was not a donor at or near death, arrange for the procurement of organs from donors, and cause organs to be allocated and transferred to recipients in accordance with their contractual obligations with the OPTN. Thus, organs passing to organ procurement organizations under this [act] for the purpose of transplantation or therapy pass to them in a custodial capacity. There is no expectation that the organ procurement organization will retain the organ. Eyes and tissue pass to the appropriate eye or tissue bank under no similar restrictions; therefore, eye and tissue banks do not properly take as a custodian.
    To assist in the evaluation of potential donors, federal law also requires hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid funding to refer all deaths or near deaths to organ procurement organizations or a third party designated by the organ procurement organization for possible organ, eye, and tissue donation.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    42 CFR § 482.45 (Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Conditions of Participation: Identification of Potential Organ, Tissue, and Eye Donors and Transplant Hospitals’ Provision of Transplant-Related Data). These referral requirements have made the provisions of Section 5 of the 1987 Act obsolete, and, accordingly, those provisions have been deleted from this [act].
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 11(i) [(9)] provides that, if parts do not pass under the preceding provisions of the [act] or are not used for transplantation, therapy, research, or education, custody of the decedent’s body or parts vests in the person under obligation to dispose of them. The person having custody to dispose of the decedent’s body is determined by law other than this [act].
       </p>
       <p>
        This [act] does not define the appropriate eye or tissue bank or organ procurement organization. Which of the many eye banks, tissue banks, or organ procurement organizations is the appropriate one is determined by factors outside the scope of this [act]. For example, hospitals, coroners or medical examiners likely will have cooperative agreements with particular eye and tissue banks that coordinate eye and tissue donations. As for the appropriate organ procurement organizations, that is determined by the policies of the OPTN.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the common law, a gift is effectuated by intent, delivery, and acceptance. (But see Section 13(a) [§ 39-3414(1)] regarding delivery). In common with general principles of gift law, an express acceptance of an anatomical gift is not required. However, Section 11(j) [(10)] provides certain bars on the acceptance of an anatomical gift by a person that would trump the “acceptance presumption.” A person may not accept an anatomical gift if the person knows of a Section 7 [§ 39-3407] refusal. A person may not accept an anatomical gift if the person knows that a gift once made had been revoked or that a gift under Section 5 or 10 [§ 39-3405 or 39-3410] was not properly made. For example, suppose the decedent’s children wish to donate organs that under Section 11 [this section] would pass to an organ procurement organization but that organization knows that the decedent’s spouse is reasonably available to make or refuse to make a gift. The organ procurement organization may not accept the purported gift from the children. Suppose an organ procurement organization knows an anatomical gift was made on a document of gift. Because of the imputed knowledge requirement in the last sentence of Section 11(j) [(10)], the organization may not accept that gift if on the same document of gift there is evidence that the gift was revoked.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, nothing in this [act] affects the allocation of organs for transplantation or therapy except in the case of a gift to a named individual under Section 11(a)(2) [(1)(b)].
    See
    Section 11(k) [(11)]. As noted above, the allocation of organs is controlled by the policies of the OPTN.

        This section remains in substance the same as the prior 1968 and 1987 Acts. The constitutional standards of “reasonable search” under state and federal laws apply. In ordinary circumstances, reasonable search would only be of the person or in the immediate vicinity of the person. No courts have applied or extended this provision to allow a random and extensive search of premises. Because most likely an anatomical gift would have been made on a driver’s license or donor registry and any donation on them is readily accessed by a procurement organization, there is no significant need to extend this section to allow searches of the premises.

        Section 13(a) [(1)], in common with prior versions of this [act], rejects the common-law principle that a gift requires delivery to be effective. With the exception of gifts of whole bodies in deeded body programs, most anatomical gifts made by a donor during the donor’s life are made without any communication between the person making the gift and the person to which the gift passes under Section 11 [§ 39-3412] and for obvious reasons — the person is likely unknown.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not affirmatively require any person in possession of a document of gift or a refusal to come forward at a decedent’s death with that information.
    But see
    Section 12(b) [§ 39-3413(2)] (obligation of certain individuals to deliver a document of gift or refusal following a search). On the other hand, if a document of gift or a refusal is in the possession of someone other than the donor, that person shall allow other persons who can make or object to the making of an anatomical gift to review and copy such records. They shall also allow the person to which a gift could pass under Section 11 [§ 39-3412] to examine and copy such documents.

        When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, Section 14(a) [(1)] requires the procurement organization to conduct a reasonable search of the motor vehicle records or of any donor registry it knows to exist for the geographical area in which that individual resides to determine if that individual is a donor. This [act] does not require a hospital to make a referral to a procurement organization. However, a referral may be required by contract or by law other than this [act].

        Procurement organizations may conduct a reasonable examination to determine the medical suitability of a part that is or could be the subject of an anatomical gift. This examination typically is made in a relatively short period of time. During the examination period, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of a part cannot be withdrawn from the individual who was referred to the procurement organization unless the procurement organization or hospital knows that individual expressly provided to the contrary.
    See
    Section 14(c) [(3)]. A general direction in a power of attorney for health care or advance health-care directive that the patient does not wish to have life prolonged by the administration of life support systems should not be construed as an expression of a contrary intent.
    <i>
     See
    </i>
    Section 14(c) [(3)].
    <i>
     See also
    </i>
    , Section 21 [§ 39-3422].
       </p>
       <p>
        Persons to whom the part passes after the donor’s death also may conduct a reasonable examination to ensure the medical suitability of the part. An examination includes an examination of the relevant medical records.
    See
    Section 14(e) [5]. Section 14(e) [5] is not inconsistent with Section 164.512(h) of the HIPAA regulations permitting the disclosure without consent of protected health information “to organ procurement organizations or other entities engaged in the procurement, banking, or transplantation of cadaveric organs, eyes, or tissue for the purpose of facilitating organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplantation.”
       </p>
       <p>
        If a minor donor dies, the minor’s parents are entitled to revoke the minor’s anatomical gift or refusal, if any. Section 14(f) [6] requires a procurement organization to make a reasonable search for the minor’s parents to provide them with an opportunity to do so.
    Under Section 14(g) [7], a procurement organization also is required to make a reasonable search for any person empowered to make a gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409]. If the donor made an anatomical gift of all parts for transplantation, therapy, research, or education or of the donor’s whole body, there would be no one under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] with a priority to make a gift because the persons listed in Section 9 [§ 39-3409] would be barred by Section 8 [§ 39-3408] from making or revoking the gift. Thus, if a donor made such a gift, there is no reason for procurement organizations to search for any of the persons named in Section 9 [§ 39-3409].
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 14(g) [(7)] also requires a procurement organization that acquires knowledge that an anatomical gift has been made to another person to advise that person of the gift. For example, suppose an organ procurement organization discovers, while searching a donor registry, that an anatomical gift was made of the eyes. The organ procurement organization is required to notify the appropriate eye bank of that gift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 14(j) [(10)] neither the physician who attends the decedent at death nor the physician who determines the time of death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part. The concept of “attends” is well known in the medical profession and contemplates the attending physician who cared for the donor during the donor’s life. This section is similar to provisions in prior law and is intended to bar what might otherwise be perceived as a conflict of interest should a physician attend both the donor and the recipient. Some surveys have suggested that a small segment of the population believes that a patient who might die without proper medical attention may not be treated in order that the patient’s organs can be used for another. While there is absolutely no evidence that this has ever occurred, this section is included in this [act] to address any public misperceptions by making clear that it should not be able to happen legally.

        42 CFR § 482.45 (Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Conditions of Participation: Identification of Potential Organ, Tissue, and Eye Donors and Transplant Hospitals’ Provision of Transplant-Related Data) sets forth criteria requiring hospitals and organ procurement organizations to have cooperative agreements to permit organ procurement organizations to determine the suitability of organs for transplant. Furthermore in the absence of alternative arrangements by a hospital, organ procurement organizations have the responsibility to determine the suitability of tissues and eyes using the definition of potential tissue and eye donors and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the hospital for this purpose. Hospitals are also required to (1) have an agreement with at least one tissue bank and one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of tissue and eyes and (2) ensure, working with organ procurement organizations, that families of potential donors are informed of the option of donating eyes, tissue, and organs.

        This section is new and addresses abuses that have been widely reported. It criminalizes the intentional falsification of a document of gift or refusal when done to obtain a financial gain. For example, suppose a person falsifies a document of gift in order to sell a decedent’s part to a research institution. The person who falsified the document of gift would be guilty of a felony.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only express liability sections in this [act] are in Section 16 [§ 39-3417] relating to sales and Section 17 [this section] relating to falsified documents. Occasional news stories have surfaced about alleged other improprieties in the procurement and allocation of organs and some have argued that this [act] should address them. However, those other improprieties are addressed by law other than this [act] or administratively, including regulatory rules, licensing requirements, Unfair and Deceptive Practices Acts, and the common law.

      <p>
       A version of subsection (a) [(1)] has been in the two prior anatomical gift acts.
    See
    Subsection 7(c) of the 1968 Act and Section 11(c) of the 1987 Act. In the 1968 Act, “good faith” had the common-law meaning of honesty-in-fact. In short, it was meant to be a subjective standard involving determination of the intent or state of mind of the person concerned, namely the honesty of intent. As the official comment for Section 7 of the 1968 Act states: “The entire section 7 merits genuinely liberal interpretation to effectuate the purpose and intent of the Uniform Act, that is, to encourage and facilitate the important and ever increasing need for human tissue and organs for medical research, education and therapy, including transplantation.” Thus, immunity was intended to be extended to persons which [who] generally and substantively act in accordance with the 1968 Act, with honesty of intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If parties were held to an overly strict adherence to this [act] when transplants must be made shortly after the decedent’s death, it might well have a chilling effect on the making of anatomical gifts for the purpose of transplantation or therapy. This [act] retains the meaning of the term of “good faith” in the 1968 Act in order to encourage and facilitate transplantation. On the other hand, if a person acts in subjective “bad faith,” the common law provides remedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to encourage donations, Section 18(b) [(2)] immunizes the person making an anatomical gift and the donor’s estate from any liability for damages resulting from the making or using of an anatomical gift. Persons who make anatomical gifts and donors have little or no ability to determine the medical suitability or risks associated with transplantation or therapy of donated parts. Risk assessment is appropriately left to the medical community, broadly conceived.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an individual at or near death who is not a donor has been referred to a procurement organization, the organization will seek out persons to discuss the possibility of making an anatomical gift if the individual had not made a refusal. Because the gift can only be made by the persons listed in Section 9 [§ 39-3409] with the appropriate priority, Section 18(c) [(3)] provides that procurement organizations can rely on the representations of the individuals listed in Section 9(a)(2) through (8) [§ 39-3409(1)(b) through (h)] as to their relationship to the donor or prospective donor. This immunity does not apply if the individual who documents a gift knows the representation is false.
    The purpose of subsection (c) [(3)] is to relieve procurement organizations of the burden of ascertaining the truthfulness of relationship claims because proof may be impracticable or time consuming in light of the need to act expeditiously to effectuate an anatomical gift. For example, if an individual claims to be the decedent’s spouse or child, the procurement organization can rely on that representation. This immunity does not run to persons claiming to be agents or guardians or persons who have authority to dispose of a decedent’s body. Agents or guardians should have documentation of their relationship readily available or their relationship to the donor or prospective donor will likely be reflected in the available medical records.

       Section 19 [this section] is new to the anatomical gift act and accomplishes two things. First, it assures that a document of gift is valid if it was valid either in the place where executed or in the place where the person making the gift was domiciled, had a residence, or was a national. This section tracks like provisions for wills, such as Section 2-506 of the Uniform Probate Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, Section 19(c) [(3)] provides that a person can presume a document of gift to be valid unless the person has actual knowledge that it was not validly executed or was revoked. For example, if the person knows that the donor had signed a Section 7 [§ 39-3407] refusal but the document of gift was signed by the decedent’s spouse following the decedent’s death, the person knows that the document of gift was not validly executed.

        A donor registry is one of many devises to facilitate the making of anatomical gifts. In time, it may prove to be the most effective way of making anatomical gifts, particularly when the records of the state department of motor vehicles and the donor registry can be coordinated to assure a unitary source of donor information. This section is intended primarily to encourage states to facilitate the creation of donor registries operated by the state or by another. This section should not be construed to prohibit otherwise valid anatomical gifts as provided for in Section 5 [§ 39-3405].
    The section sets forth minimum requirements for a donor registry whether created by the state or not. These requirements are that the registry: (1) provide an electronic database that allows persons to make an anatomical gift by use of a statement or symbol; (2) be accessible to all procurement organizations at or near the time of death of a donor or prospective donor to determine whether the donor or prospective donor made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; and (3) be operational on a seven day a week, twenty-four hour basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (d) [(3)], a donor’s personally identifiable information on a donor registry may not be used or disclosed without appropriate consent except to determine whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift.

       <p>
        This section does not require states to create or contract for the creation of a donor registry. It merely gives them discretion to do so. Also, this section does not bar the creation of a private donor registry although it does require private registries to meet the requirements in subsection (c) and (d) [(2) and (3)].
       </p>
       <p>
        Although every donor registry meeting the requirements of Section 20 [this section] would also meet the Section 2(8) [§ 39-3402(8)] definition of a donor registry, the definition of a donor registry in Section 2(8) [§ 39-3402(8)] is not tied to meeting the Section 20 [this section] requirements. This was purposeful. A donor registry as a place to make an anatomical gift should be broadly defined to respect the wishes of donors who make an anatomical gift on a registry that should, but failed to, comply with this section.

Information relevant to the resolution of the conflict may be obtained from the appropriate procurement organization and any other person authorized to make an anatomical gift for the prospective donor under section 39-3409, Idaho Code. Before resolution of the conflict, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part may not be withheld or withdrawn from the prospective donor if withholding or withdrawing the measures is not contraindicated by appropriate end-of-life care.

        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 176, in subsection (1)(a), inserted “or authorized”; in subsection (1)(c), deleted “made” following “any decision”; and rewrote subsection (2), which formerly read: “If a prospective donor has a declaration or advance health care directive, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of an organ for transplantation or therapy may not be withheld or withdrawn from the prospective donor, unless the declaration expressly provides to the contrary.”

       <p>
        This section differs from Section 14(c) [§ 39-3415(3)]. That section provides that measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of a part not be withdrawn while an examination is being made to determine whether an individual who has been referred to a procurement organization has a part that could be the subject of an anatomical gift. It applies when a patient on life support systems is referred to a procurement organization for evaluation as a prospective donor as required under federal rules relating to required referrals. If, following such an examination, it is determined by the procurement organization that the individual has a part that could be the subject of an anatomical gift, the individual is a prospective donor under this section unless the individual had signed a refusal. In light of the definition of a prospective donor,
    see
    Section 2(22) [§ 39-3402(22)], this section also applies to a donor near death who has medically suitable organs for transplantation as determined by the organ procurement organization.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a prospective donor made an anatomical gift under Section 5 [§ 39-3405] or the prospective donor’s family contemplates making an anatomical gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] and the prospective donor signed an advance health-care directive or declaration expressing the intent to have life support systems withdrawn, a potential conflict arises between that intent and the need to administer certain measures to ensure the medical suitability of any part that could be the subject of an anatomical gift. For example, the prospective donor may have expressed the intent to have a respirator withdrawn in a declaration, yet it may be necessary to continue a respirator to assure the medical suitability of a donated part.
       </p>
       <p>
        If this conflict exists, it becomes necessary to determine the prospective donor’s actual or likely intent to resolve it. Of course, if the prospective donor is able to do so, the prospective donor’s decision controls. If the prospective donor is unable to resolve the conflict, it is resolved by the prospective donor’s agent. If there is no agent, the conflict is resolved by another individual authorized by other law to make health-care decisions on the prospective donor’s behalf. While the consultation occurs, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part shall continue to be administered unless the administration would be contraindicated by appropriate end of life care.
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision of the prospective donor, agent, or other individual whether or not to withdraw the life support system is final. This process recognizes that it is the intent of the prospective donor as determined by the prospective donor or those designated by the prospective donor or by law that is paramount, even though a decision to withdraw life support may result in the loss of parts for transplantation or therapy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The conflict should be resolved as expeditiously as possible. Furthermore to assist in resolving the conflict and providing the decision maker with necessary medical information, the decision maker shall consult with the prospective donor’s attending physician, presumably about all medical matters relating how the continued administration or withdrawal of the measures would affect the patient. Any consultation may also include the appropriate procurement organization and any other person authorized under Section 9 [§ 39-3409] to make an anatomical gift. The procurement organization presumably provides information relating to why the continued administration of the measure is necessary, the length of time they would be necessary, and other relevant information.

      <p>
       This section includes a number of provisions designed to allow for the cooperation of procurement organizations and [coroners] [medical examiners] in obtaining bodies and parts that otherwise are the subject of an anatomical gift. Unlike prior law, this section does not empower [coroners] [medical examiners] to make an anatomical gift of the body or parts of a decedent. However, and although quite rare, if the [coroner] [medical examiner] is the person with authority to dispose of the decedent’s body and has the priority to make a gift under Section 9 [§ 39-3409], the [coroner] [medical examiner] could make an anatomical gift under Section 10 [§ 39-3410].

      § 39-3501. Legislative intent and declaration.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of a certified family home in Idaho is to provide a homelike alternative designed to allow individuals to remain in a more normal family-styled living environment, usually within their own community. Certified family homes provide a home to individuals who are elderly, individuals with a mental illness, developmental disabilities, physical disabilities or to those unable to live alone, and whose mental, emotional and physical condition can be met by the care provider to delay the need for more expensive congregate care or other institutional care. The home must obtain a waiver under section 39-1301A, Idaho Code, to care for two (2) persons requiring care described in section 39-1301(b), Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature that certified family homes be available to meet the needs of those residing in these homes while providing a more homelike environment focused on integrated community living rather than other more restrictive environments and by recognizing the capabilities of individuals to direct their own care.
     </p>
     <p>
      The certified family home shall be operated by a provider who has demonstrated the knowledge and experience required to provide safe and appropriate services to each resident of the certified family home. The provider shall protect each resident’s rights and provide appropriate services to meet each resident’s needs. For those residents whose care is not paid with public funds, the certified family home shall conduct an objective, individualized assessment to determine resident needs, develop a comprehensive negotiated plan of service to meet those needs, deliver appropriate services to meet resident needs and ensure resident rights are honored.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the provisions of this chapter. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to: monitoring the condition of the certified family home, ensuring that each resident has an individualized written plan of care that includes activities of daily living and support services, and managing enforcement procedures when violations occur.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature, recognizing that surface water is one of the state’s most valuable natural resources, has approved the adoption of water quality standards and authorized the director of the department of environmental quality in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, to implement these standards. In order to maintain and achieve existing and designated beneficial uses and to conform to the expressed intent of congress to control pollution of navigable waters of the United States, the legislature declares that it is the purpose of this chapter to enhance and preserve the quality and value of the navigable waters of the United States within the state of Idaho, and to define the responsibilities of public agencies in the control, and monitoring of water pollution, and, through implementation of this chapter, enhance the state’s economic well-being. In consequence of the benefits resulting to the public health, welfare and economy, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the state of Idaho to protect this natural resource by monitoring and controlling water pollution; to support and aid technical and planning research leading to the control of water pollution, and to provide financial and technical assistance to municipalities, soil conservation districts and other agencies in the control of water pollution. The director, in cooperation with such other agencies as may be appropriate, shall administer this chapter. It is the intent of the legislature that the state of Idaho fully meet the goals and requirements of the federal clean water act and that the rules promulgated under this chapter not impose requirements beyond those of the federal clean water act.

Designated uses shall be reviewed and revised when such physical, geological, hydrological, atmospheric, chemical or biological measures indicate the need to do so.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a minor fourteen (14) years of age or older who may have come into contact with any infectious, contagious, or communicable disease may give consent to the furnishing of hospital, medical and surgical care related to the diagnosis or treatment of such disease, if the disease or condition is one which is required by law, or regulation adopted pursuant to law, to be reported to the local health officer.

     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho acknowledges that sterilization procedures are highly intrusive, generally irreversible and represent potentially permanent and highly significant consequences for individuals incapable of giving informed consent. The legislature recognizes that certain legal safeguards are required to prevent indiscriminate and unnecessary sterilization of such individuals, and to assure equal access to desired medical procedures for all Idaho citizens.

     <p>
      The legislature intends that the state of Idaho enact and carry out a hazardous waste program that will enable the state to assume primacy over hazardous waste control from the federal government.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that the RCRA, as amended, 42 U.S.C., section 6901 et seq., and federal regulations adopted pursuant thereto, establish complex and detailed provisions for regulation of those who generate, transport, treat, store, and dispose of hazardous wastes. The legislature cannot conveniently or advantageously set forth in this chapter all the requirements of all of the regulations which have been or will be established under RCRA. However, by the provisions of this chapter, the legislature desires to avoid the existence of duplicative, overlapping or conflicting state and federal regulatory systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Therefore, the board is directed to promulgate rules which are consistent with RCRA and the federal regulations adopted by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency to implement RCRA. Farmers and ranchers who treat, store, or dispose of waste pesticides from their operations on lands owned or controlled by them shall not be required by board rules to do anything more than follow the instructions on the pesticide label and triple rinse empty containers in accordance with the RCRA regulations of the environmental protection agency. The board may not promulgate any rule that would impose conditions or requirements more stringent or broader in scope than RCRA and the RCRA regulations of the environmental protection agency. The board may, however, promulgate procedural rules and rules specifically authorized by this chapter or other state statutes without showing that those rules are required by RCRA or the regulations of the environmental protection agency; provided that those rules shall not conflict with this section, other sections of this chapter, RCRA, or the regulations of the environmental protection agency. Any rule promulgated by the board shall be valid until it is repealed or modified through the administrative process of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.
