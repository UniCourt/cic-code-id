        Damages may be recovered in addition to an injunction or abatement, but are not a prerequisite to such equitable relief, and the failure to recover damages does not necessarily mean there can be no injunction or abatement, if that equitable relief is otherwise appropriate.

        Given the abundant testimony in the record as to presence of offensive odors at the hog-farm residence, as well as the copious number of flies, it was clear that the district court’s nuisance determination was supported by substantial and competent evidence.

        Where the homeowner alleged that her home was flooded as the result of a road reconstruction project performed by the city, her complaint was not separated into multiple causes of action; the only theory of recovery identified was negligence; because the complaint failed to include a short and plain statement of her claim for nuisance under this section, the district court properly granted summary judgment for the city.

        Channel of Natural Streams.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The current of a river cannot be appropriated by a riparian proprietor in Idaho, even assuming the possible persistence in the state of the doctrine of riparian rights, in view of statutes declaring the right of appropriators of water for irrigation or other lawful purpose to use the channel of natural streams for carrying stored water or water diverted from other streams. Johnson v. Utah Power & Light Co., 215 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant built a series of dams that increased the flow of a river to such an extent that plaintiff’s access to his farm land, which was across the river from his place of residence and which situation made it necessary for plaintiff to ford the river in order to reach his farm land, was obstructed and plaintiff sought to recover damages on the theory that the dams constituted a nuisance, court held that, by statute, defendant and other appropriators of water for lawful purposes had right to use channel of natural streams for carrying stored water or water diverted from other streams.

        Ditch Across Road or Street.
       </h5>
       <p>
        When one constructs ditch across public street in such way as to render street unsafe or inconvenient for travel and maintains the same without a bridge, he is guilty of maintaining a nuisance. Lewiston v. Booth, 3 Idaho 692, 34 P. 809 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        To complete highway across canal, bridge must be built; and, until bridge is built, highway, not being complete, is not capable of being lawfully obstructed at that point; canal, therefore, is not nuisance because of its unlawfully obstructing the free passage or use of highway. MacCammelly v. Pioneer Irrigation Dist., 17 Idaho 415, 105 P. 1076 (1909).
       </p>

        Where canal has been constructed and operated in accordance with law, it is not a nuisance and can become nuisance only by reason of manner in which it is maintained or method of its operation, and mere fact that municipality subsequently extends street across canal which has been lawfully constructed and operated does not convert canal into nuisance at place where street crosses canal.

        Sellers’ contention that purchasers were not bound to remove encroachments of tourist site and equipment sold to them upon demand by the city inasmuch as the city has permitted the existence of such encroachments for a considerable time was not well taken, and it became the duty of the purchasers to remove such encroachments, as failure to do so would result in both civil and criminal liability. Such encroachments were a public nuisance and subject to abatement. Galvin v. Appleby, 78 Idaho 457, 305 P.2d 309 (1956).

        The current of a river cannot be appropriated by a riparian proprietor in Idaho, even assuming the possible persistence in that state of the doctrine of riparian rights, in view of statutes declaring the right of appropriators of water for irrigation or other lawful purpose to use the channel of natural streams for carrying stored water or water diverted from other streams.

        Where defendant built a series of dams that increased the flow of a river to such extent that plaintiff’s access to his farm land, which was across the river from his place of residence and which situation made it necessary for plaintiff to ford the river in order to reach his farm land, was obstructed and plaintiff sought to recover damages on the theory that the dams constituted a nuisance, court held that, by statute, defendant and other appropriators of water for lawful purposes had right to use channel of natural streams for carrying stored water or water diverted from other streams. Johnson v. Utah Power & Light Co., 215 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1954). Fluctuating River Flow.

       <p>
        An easement which granted a power company the right to fluctuate the flow of a river would be construed as granting something in addition to the right of the power company to fill completely the natural channel of the river, since the power company had the latter right without the aid of an easement.

      Anything which is injurious to health or morals, or indecent, or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, is a nuisance and the subject of an action. In the case of a moral nuisance, the action may be brought by any resident citizen of the county; in all other cases the action may be brought by any person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance; and by the judgment the nuisance may be enjoined or abated, as well as damages recovered.

        Summary judgment in favor of the bar on the resident’s negligence claim was proper because the resident failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the bar owed a duty to the resident or created a public nuisance under this section. The assault on the resident occurred outside of the bar, was by an unknown assailant, and was not foreseeable. Jones v. Starnes, 150 Idaho 257, 245 P.3d 1009 (2011).

        Damages may be recovered in addition to an injunction or abatement, but are not a prerequisite to such equitable relief, and the failure to recover damages does not necessarily mean there can be no injunction or abatement, if that equitable relief is otherwise appropriate.

    Even though landowners had prevailed in their claim for a nuisance caused by the neighbors’ interference with their use of a driveway easement, the district court properly denied the landowners’ monetary damages, where the nuisance had stopped, the driveway was no longer obstructed, and there was no diminished property value.

        Where something constitutes a nuisance because of particular objectionable features associated with it, a court should not enjoin the entire activity, but rather should only attempt to eliminate the objectionable features. McVicars v. Christensen, 156 Idaho 58, 320 P.3d 948 (2014).

       <p>
        Private person may sue to abate or restrain continuance of public nuisance, provided he alleges and shows that such nuisance is especially injurious to himself. Thus, a person whose property is rendered undesirable as a residence and thereby depreciated in value because of the maintenance of a house of prostitution in the neighborhood may sue to enjoin the continued maintenance of the same as a nuisance. Redway v. Moore, 3 Idaho 312, 29 P. 104 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        A private person who is especially injured by the maintenance of obstructions in a navigable river may sue to abate the same. Small v. Harrington, 10 Idaho 499, 79 P. 461 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        A reasonable obstruction in a navigable stream, which merely impairs navigation but does not destroy it, cannot be enjoined at the suit of a private person. Small v. Harrington, 10 Idaho 499, 79 P. 461 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        To authorize a private person to bring an action to abate a public nuisance, the plaintiff must allege and show that he will be specially injured in a different way from the public generally or deprived of the free use of his own private property. Stricker v. Hillis, 15 Idaho 709, 99 P. 831 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        To have suffered in a different manner or extent than the public at large is to have received a special and peculiar damage for which a recovery may be had. Stricker v. Hillis, 17 Idaho 646, 106 P. 1128 (1910).

The equipment plaintiffs took to the site crossed over sagebrush land causing no injury and they had a right to reasonable access to the channel to secure and safeguard their water right. Ward v. Kidd, 87 Idaho 216, 392 P.2d 183 (1964).

     <p>
      The attorney general, prosecuting attorney, or any private resident citizen of the county may maintain an action of an equitable nature, as relator, in the name of the state of Idaho, to abate a moral nuisance, perpetually to enjoin all persons from maintaining the same, and to enjoin the use of any structure or thing adjudged to be a moral nuisance.

     <p>
      If such action is instituted by a private person, the complainant shall execute a bond prior to the issuance of a restraining order or a temporary injunction, with good and sufficient surety to be approved by the court or clerk thereof, in the sum of not less than five hundred dollars ($500), to secure to the party enjoined the damages he may sustain if such action is wrongfully brought, not prosecuted to final judgment, or is dismissed, or is not maintained, or if it is finally decided that the restraining order or temporary injunction ought not to have been granted. The party enjoined shall have recourse against said bond for all damages suffered, including damages to his property, person, or character and including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by him in making defense to said action. No bond shall be required of the prosecuting attorney or the attorney general, and no action shall be maintained against the public official for his official action when brought in good faith.

     <p>
      Where such application for a temporary injunction is made, the court may, on application of the complainant showing good cause, issue an ex parte restraining order, restraining the defendant and all other persons from removing or in any manner interfering with the personal property and contents of the place where such nuisance is alleged to exist, until the decision of the court or judge granting or refusing such temporary injunction and until the further order of the court thereon, except that, pending such decision, the stock in trade may not be so restrained, but an inventory and full accounting of all business transactions thereafter may be required.
     </p>
     <p>
      The restraining order may be served by handing to and leaving a copy of such order with any person in charge of such place or residing therein, or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place at or upon one or more of the principal doors or entrances to such place, or by both such delivery and posting. The officer serving such restraining order shall forthwith make and return into court an inventory of the personal property and contents situated in and used in conducting or maintaining such nuisance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any violation of such restraining order is a contempt of court, and where such order is posted, mutilation or removal thereof, while the same remains in force, is a contempt of court, provided such posted order contains therein a notice to that effect.

      A copy of the complaint, together with a notice of the time and place of the hearing of the application for a temporary injunction, shall be served upon the defendant at least five (5) days before such hearing. The place may also be served by posting such papers in the same manner as is provided for in section 52-404, Idaho Code, in the case of a restraining order.

      Before or after the commencement of the hearing of an application for a temporary injunction, the court, on application of either of the parties or on its own motion, may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the application for the temporary injunction. Any evidence received upon an application for a temporary injunction which would be admissible upon the trial on the merits becomes a part of the record of the trial and need not be repeated as to such parties at the trial on the merits.

        Where the state filed suit against two adult bookstores asking injunctive relief abating the alleged nuisance and for forfeiture of the use of the real property in question, the one-year closure or forfeiture order did not by itself constitute an unlawful prior restraint upon the exercise of free speech; such finding was based upon (1) the extensive power of the state to impose a forfeiture on neutral and innocent property used in the commission of forbidden acts, (2) the power of the state to impose sanctions of its choice upon those who disseminate unprotected obscenity, (3) the fact that the forfeiture or closure order was not directed at any speech or publication, but was instead aimed at the real property apart from the content of expression contained therein, and (4) the fact that the defendants remained free to disseminate any materials, except those already determined to be obscene, at any other location, subject to further penal actions by the state should the defendants again violate laws regulating obscenity. State ex rel. Kidwell v. United States Mktg., Inc., 102 Idaho 451, 631 P.2d 622 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 1009, 102 S. Ct. 1649, 71 L. Ed. 2d 878 (1982). Purpose.

     </p>
     <p>
      Such order shall also require the renewal for one (1) year of any bond furnished by the owner of the real property, as provided in section 52-407, Idaho Code, or, if not so furnished, shall continue for one (1) year any closing order issued at the time of granting the temporary injunction, or, if no such closing order was then issued, shall include an order directing the effectual closing of the place against its use for any purpose, and keeping it closed for a period of one (1) year unless sooner released.

If such innocence is established, such unsold personal property and contents shall be delivered to the owner, otherwise it shall be sold as provided in this section.

All personal property declared to be a moral nuisance in section 52-104, Idaho Code, and all monies and other considerations declared to be a moral nuisance under section 52-105, Idaho Code, are the subject of forfeiture to the local government and are recoverable as damages in the county wherein such matter is sold, exhibited or otherwise used.

An amount equal to the sum of all monies estimated to have been taken in as gross income from such unlawful commercial activity shall be forfeited to the general funds of the city and county governments wherein such matter is sold or exhibited, to be shared equally, as a forfeiture of the fruits of an unlawful enterprise, and as partial restitution for damages done to the public welfare, public health and public morals.

        The portion of this section relating to recovery of abatement costs is clearly remedial in nature and should be liberally construed to effect its manifest objectives. State ex rel. Kidwell v.

        In an action to abate two adult bookstores as moral nuisances, where the trial court awarded only nominal attorney fees to the state, on the ground that the state had failed to keep hourly time sheets, and denied the state all other abatement costs, such award was not in keeping with the legislative policy of this section and was insufficient. State ex rel. Kidwell v. United States Mktg., Inc., 102 Idaho 451, 631 P.2d 622 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 1009, 102 S. Ct. 1649, 71 L. Ed. 2d 878 (1982). Constitutionality.

        This section, which awards abatement costs only to a prevailing plaintiff, does not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution where the award furthers a legitimate governmental objective.
