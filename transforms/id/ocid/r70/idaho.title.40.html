        Where in an action by plaintiff residents of an unincorporated area of a county to have certain roads declared public highways and to require the county to maintain the roads, the evidence showed that the county had regularly maintained the roads for approximately nine years, that the roads had been extensively used by the general public, and that the sales of several lots within the area had been made with particular reliance upon several written representations made by various members of the board of county commissioners that the roads would be maintained by the county, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the county because a substantial fact issue existed as to whether the county had accepted the roads.

        A street within a city was a highway within the meaning of the law imposing a tax upon gasoline, and the municipality could not escape its liability for such tax on the ground that it did not use the highway of the state, since the municipality receives benefits by reason of the state highway surrounding it.

        In an action to establish a public highway, the evidence sustained a judgment for the defendant on the ground that there were no positive acts on the part of the public authorities clearly manifesting an intention to accept a trail as a public highway, as required by federal law, and the use of the trail by the public was merely casual and was insufficient to establish the highway.

        Generally, in order to constitute an acceptance of the congressional grant of a right of way for public highway across public lands, there had to be either use by the public for such a period of time and under such conditions as to establish a highway under the state law, or there had to be some positive act or acts on the part of the proper public authorities clearly manifesting an intention to accept the grant with respect to the particular highway.

        Where a highway was dedicated to the public use as early as 1879, its width and boundary lines were properly established and are as shown by the surveys; therefore, the state was entitled to improve and expand the use of the highway to its entire width to meet increasing traffic demands.

        Where the legislature enacts a statute requiring that an administrative agency carry out specific functions, i.e., furnish, erect and maintain signs on side highways, that agency cannot validly subvert the legislation by promulgating contradictory rules; thus, although the legislature delegated some rule-making authority to the DOT to adopt specifications for a uniform system of traffic-control devices, the department was not thereby permitted to institute rules or policies limiting its ability to achieve its express statutory duties to place signs on side roads.

        In a prosecution against Indian tribe member for leaving the scene of an accident and for aggravated driving under the influence, where the defendant challenged the state’s jurisdiction over a section of U.S. highway 95 that is within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, the trial court could have taken judicial notice of the “Official Highway Map” which the Idaho Transportation Department periodically issues and widely distributes for convenience of motorists; while these maps may not be conclusive on the subject of “principal” highways, they are reliable authority.

        An administrative agency may not alter, modify or diminish its statutorily-imposed responsibilities, either unilaterally or through agreement with another public or private entity, absent legislative authority to do so; thus, the fact that the county highway district had assumed part of the DOT’s legal obligations might affect the rights and liabilities between the department and the county highway district; however, such an agreement between these two entities did not alter the statutory duty owed by the department to the plaintiff involved in a car wreck.

       <p>
        The DOT alone has an express statutory duty with respect to erecting and maintaining signs at its highways’ intersections; the legislature in no way qualified this duty by the condition that the sign-placing or maintenance activities occur exclusively within boundaries of the state highway system; thus, contrary to the department’s position that it was without “jurisdiction” to place and maintain signs outside of its right-of-way, the department had both the authority and an express statutory duty to do so.

        <li id="t40c02s40-202ol11a">
         The board of county or highway district commissioners shall cause a map to be prepared showing the general location of each highway and public right-of-way in its jurisdiction, and the commissioners shall cause notice to be given of intention to adopt the map as the official map of that system, and shall specify the time and place at which all interested persons may be heard.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c02s40-202ol11b">
         After the hearing, the commissioners shall adopt the map, with any changes or revisions considered by them to be advisable in the public interest, as the official map of the respective highway system.

       Highways laid out, recorded and opened as described in subsection (2) of this section, by order of a board of commissioners, and all highways used for a period of five (5) years, provided they shall have been worked and kept up at the expense of the public, or located and recorded by order of a board of commissioners, are highways. If a highway created in accordance with the provisions of this subsection is not opened as described in subsection (2) of this section, there shall be no duty to maintain that highway, nor shall there be any liability for any injury or damage for failure to maintain it or any highway signs, until the highway is designated as a part of the county or highway district system and opened to public travel as a highway.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-202ol14">
       When a public right-of-way is created in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, or section 40-203 or 40-203A, Idaho Code, there shall be no duty to maintain that public right-of-way, nor shall there be any liability for any injury or damage for failure to maintain it or any highway signs.

       By July 1, 2005, and at least every five (5) years thereafter, the board of county or highway district commissioners shall publish in map form and make readily available a map showing the general location of all highways and public rights-of-way under its jurisdiction. Any board of county or highway district commissioners may be granted an extension of time with approval of the legislature by adoption of a concurrent resolution.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-202ol17">
       Prior to designating a new highway or public right-of-way on the official map, the board of county or highway district commissioners shall confirm that no legal abandonment has occurred on the new highway or right-of-way to be added to the official map. In addition, the board of county or highway district commissioners shall have some basis indicating dedication, purchase, prescriptive use or other means for the creation of a highway and public right-of-way with evidentiary support.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-202ol18">
       The board of county or highway district commissioners shall give advance notice of hearing, by U.S. mail, to any landowner upon or within whose land the highway or public right-of-way is located whenever a highway or public right-of-way is proposed for inclusion on such map and the public status of such highway or public right-of-way is not already a matter of public record. The purpose of this official map is to put the public on notice of those highways and public rights-of-way that the board of county or highway district commissioners considers to be public. The inclusion or exclusion of a highway or public right-of-way from such a map does not, in itself, constitute a legal determination of the public status of such highway or public right-of-way. Any person may challenge, at any time, the inclusion or exclusion of a highway or public right-of-way from such map by initiating proceedings as described in section 40-208(7), Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-202ol19">
       Nothing in this section or in any designation of the general location of a highway or public right-of-way shall authorize the public highway agency to assert or claim rights superior to or in conflict with any rights-of-way that resulted from the creation of a facility for the transmission of water which existed before the designation of the location of a highway or public right-of-way.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Provided, however, a county with highway jurisdiction or highway district may hold title to an interest in real property for public right-of-way purposes without incurring an obligation to construct or maintain a highway within the right-of-way until the county or highway district determines that the necessities of public travel justify opening a highway within the right-of-way. The lack of an opening shall not constitute an abandonment, and mere use by the public shall not constitute an opening of the public right-of-way.

        Objective manifestations of intent to create a public highway include designating the road as a public highway by the proper public authorities; recording the road as a public highway by order of the board of county commissioners; and the regular maintenance of the road by public expenditure. Burrup v. Stanger, 114 Idaho 50, 753 P.2d 261 (Ct. App.), aff’d, 115 Idaho 114, 765 P.2d 139 (1988).

       <p>
        Where the only objective manifestation of the county’s intention relevant to the road was the county’s road work, the work performed by the county road crews in improving the road 900 feet into the landowner’s property was merely to assist the landowners in moving their mobile home onto the property, and the snow plowing was done as a gratuitous aid while the mobile home was occupied, the county’s maintenance was not sufficient under this section to support the conclusion that the road had become a public highway.

        A sufficient showing of public use under this section must demonstrate that the public has used the road regularly, as it would any similar public highway, and that public funds were used to maintain the road for a five-year period; the maintenance being more than occasional or sporadic, but as was necessary.

       <p>
        The maintenance of a road need only consist of work and repairs that are reasonably necessary; it need not be performed in each of five consecutive years nor through the entire length of the road. Roberts v. Swim, 117 Idaho 9, 784 P.2d 339 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Maintenance of a roadway by a public agency under an express contract, which exchanges such maintenance for limited public access while recognizing the private character of the road, creates no public rights in the roadway beyond those granted by the agreement. Roberts v. Swim, 117 Idaho 9, 784 P.2d 339 (Ct. App. 1989).

       <p>
        To show public use under this section, the facts must demonstrate that minor maintenance work or snow removal, done by the public road crews, was not a mere gratuitous aid to the local landowners or citizens; likewise, it must be shown that the public agency has not expressly agreed to maintain the roadway while continuing to recognize it as private, in exchange for certain, limited public use, thereby not intending to create or assert rights greater than those allowed in the agreement. Burrup v. Stanger, 114 Idaho 50, 753 P.2d 261 (Ct. App.), aff’d, 115 Idaho 114, 765 P.2d 139 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary factual questions in determining whether a road can be declared a public highway are the frequency, nature and quality of the public’s use and maintenance. Burrup v. Stanger, 114 Idaho 50, 753 P.2d 261 (Ct. App.), aff’d, 115 Idaho 114, 765 P.2d 139 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        To show public use under this section, it must be demonstrated that the public’s use of the road was not merely the result of permission given by the owner, as opposed to acquiescence of the owner. Burrup v. Stanger, 114 Idaho 50, 753 P.2d 261 (Ct. App.), aff’d, 115 Idaho 114, 765 P.2d 139 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The expenditures of forest service money on a road abandoned by the county were not at the expense of the public within this section; therefore, the forest service rights were private and did not qualify the road as a “public” or “county” road. French v. Sorensen, 113 Idaho 950, 751 P.2d 98 (1988), overruled on other grounds, Cardenas v. Kurpjuweit, 116 Idaho 739, 779 P.2d 414 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regular maintenance and extensive public use are sufficient to establish the existence of the public status of a roadway. Roberts v. Swim, 117 Idaho 9, 784 P.2d 339 (Ct. App. 1989).

        Given that subsection (3) does not require that the public’s use be hostile to the landowner’s use, the trial court erred, as a matter of law, when it imposed a hostility requirement not found in the statute. Whether the use of a portion of a road and a boat ramp was permissive was irrelevant to the applicability of the statute. E. Side Highway Dist. v. Delavan, — Idaho —, — P.3d —, 2019 Ida.

       </p>
       <p>
        The use and maintenance of a road by a public entity must be something more than occasional or sporadic to change the character from private to public. Rice v. Miniver, 112 Idaho 1069, 739 P.2d 368 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under liberal pleading standards, the plaintiff’s complaint was adequate to raise a claim that the road had become a country road through public use and county maintenance. The complaint was very general and did not specifically allege any of the three manners of creation of public roads specified in this section. Although the plaintiff’s complaint lacked desirable detail and specificity, it was sufficient to encompass a claim that the road was rendered a public highway through public use and county maintenance for a period of more than five years. John W. Brown Properties v. Blaine County, 129 Idaho 740, 932 P.2d 368 (Ct. App. 1997).

       <p>
        District court’s finding of regular maintenance and public use of the disputed strip was supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record; the evidence revealed that the strip was used frequently by adjacent landowners and individuals accessing the businesses of the adjacent landowners and, therefore, supported a conclusion of extensive public use, and the road had been maintained by the Ada County highway district as necessary since 1978.

        Mere nonuse of a portion of the total width of the highway over a period of years did not constitute an abandonment; therefore defendants were estopped from claiming right and title due to occupation and use of land upon which obstruction stood without interruption for 30 years in spite of the fact that the area in dispute had not been used for highway purposes or kept up or maintained at public expense.

        The finding of the trial court that a road was a public easement was unsupported by any evidence and, therefore, was clearly erroneous, where the road had been paved and maintained by the city since 1973, but the action was commenced in May of 1977.

       <p>
        Highway by prescription exists by virtue of user and not on the theory of a grant or dedication. Thus it may be acquired over open and uninclosed land although owner has no desire to use land over which same runs. Gross v. McNutt, 4 Idaho 286, 38 P. 935 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Road could not have been deemed a public highway by user where it was constructed and kept in repair by private landowner who maintained gate across the same. Palmer v. Northern Pac. R.R., 11 Idaho 583, 83 P. 947 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public use of highway for the statutory period and the keeping of it in repair at public expense established a highway by prescription, whether road is recorded or not. Meservey v. Gulliford, 14 Idaho 133, 93 P. 780 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a landowner fences his land and leaves a tract 50 feet wide outside of his fence for public road, and public travels such road for five years or more, public has acquired a prescriptive right thereto and owner may not obstruct said road. State v. Berg, 28 Idaho 724, 155 P. 968 (1916).
    Where there had been little travel over any part of a road and little work done by way of maintaining it and a portion thereof, although maintained, was not in the condition for ordinary vehicular traffic, the court was justified in refusing to find that a road had been established by prescription. Kootenai County v. Kinman, 56 Idaho 1, 47 P.2d 887 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there were no positive acts on the part of public authorities manifesting an intention to accept a trail as a public highway, a casual use by the public was insufficient to establish a highway. Kirk v. Schultz, 63 Idaho 278, 119 P.2d 266 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Roads were public highways where one road was used in excess of five years prior to 1893, and other road was duly recorded in 1916 and thereafter was used by the public for 35 years, and work was performed thereon at public expense. Kosanke v. Kopp, 74 Idaho 302, 261 P.2d 815 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the public used a highway or road for the statutory period of five years and it was worked and kept up at public expense, a highway was established by prescription and recording of it as such by the board of county commissioners was not necessary. State v. Nesbitt, 79 Idaho 1, 310 P.2d 787 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The uninterrupted and continuous use of a roadway for more than the prescriptive period while generally creating the presumption that the use is hostile did not in Idaho give rise to an irrefutable or conclusive presumption, since one claiming an easement by prescription over wild lands by mere use was not granted the presumption of adverse user. Cox v. Cox, 84 Idaho 513, 373 P.2d 929 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a right-of-way has been used by the general public for a period of five years and has been maintained at public expense, the right-of-way became a public highway. State ex rel. Haman v. Fox, 100 Idaho 140, 594 P.2d 1093 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in an action by plaintiff residents of an unincorporated area of a county to have certain roads declared public highways and to require the county to maintain the roads, the evidence showed that the county had regularly maintained the roads for approximately nine years, that the roads had been extensively used by the general public, and that the sales of several lots within the area had been made with particular reliance upon several written representations made by various members of the board of county commissioners that the roads would be maintained by the county, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the county because a substantial fact issue existed as to whether the county had accepted the roads. Pugmire v. Johnson, 102 Idaho 882, 643 P.2d 832 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary that roads be laid out and recorded as highways before they could become public roads; all that was necessary was that the roads have been used by the public for five years or longer and that they have been worked and kept up at public expense.

        Where the commissioners acted according to a reasonable interpretation of former similar law when they issued a declaration that a road was public, and such law had no provision which required notice to the affected landowner before the county attempted to enforce their decision, the commissioners were entitled to qualified good-faith immunity from suit for damages since the law was not clearly established at the time of their actions.

        Under former law regarding recorded and worked highways roads might have been laid out and recorded as highways by order of the board of commissioners, and all roads used as such for a period of five years, provided the latter should have been worked and kept up at the expense of the public or located and recorded by order of the board of commissioners, are highways. State v. Nesbitt, 79 Idaho 1, 310 P.2d 787 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary that highway be worked throughout its entire length at public expense to become a highway by prescription; it need not be worked at places where there is no necessity for working it. Gross v. McNutt, 4 Idaho 286, 38 P. 935 (1894); State v. Berg, 28 Idaho 724, 155 P. 968 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was evidence of use, but none that road was “laid out and recorded” or “worked and kept up at expense of public,” court was right in concluding it was not public road. Ross v. Swearingen, 39 Idaho 35, 225 P. 1021 (1924); Oregon S.L.R.R. v. Caldwell, 39 Idaho 71, 226 P. 175 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not required that a prescriptive road be worked on for five consecutive years nor did former law require work to be done throughout the road’s entire length, but only required that such work as may be needed be done when necessary for the statutory period, in order to acquire a road by prescription.

        The public maintenance of a county road did not cause every lane or road that touches or crosses the county road to become a public one, access alone to the county road not being sufficient to make it a public highway. Cox v. Cox, 84 Idaho 513, 373 P.2d 929 (1962). Public Use.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where gates were in existence across a road barring the passage and making it necessary to open them in order to use the road, the existence of such gates was considered as strong evidence that the road was not a public road. Cox v. Cox, 84 Idaho 513, 373 P.2d 929 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The facts that the road had not been used for five years by the public, was maintained at the expense of the respondent and that the gates were kept closed, the road only being used by the public with the consent and permission of the respondent, supported the finding of the court that the road did not meet the requirements of former law regarding recorded and worked highways to be classified as a highway. Cox v. Cox, 84 Idaho 513, 373 P.2d 929 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        A road which has not been laid out and recorded as a highway by order of the board of county commissioners, nor been worked and kept up at public expense, cannot be classified as a highway; therefore, property owners were entitled to injunctive relief to prevent its use by others. Cox v. Cox, 84 Idaho 513, 373 P.2d 929 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence was sufficient to justify the court in concluding that the road was not a public road but that it was one over which people had traveled at will but on which landowners through whose lands it extended had felt at liberty for many years to maintain and had maintained gates. Cox v. Cox, 84 Idaho 513, 373 P.2d 929 (1962).

        Where the public agency expending funds on a roadway expressly recognized the private character of the road, and did not intend to create or to assert any rights greater than those allowed by the owner of the roadway, law regarding recorded and worked highways did not operate to make the road public.

        Where the state’s use of labor and equipment on a road running across private property was done largely to provide the state with access into the area in the event of forest fires and gave the state more convenient access to its own timber lands in the area, and where the state did not assert any public ownership or control over the road and neither the county nor any other public agency claimed the road to be public, but on the contrary, the state specifically sought and obtained written permission to use the road for its limited purposes and also entered into right-of-way agreements with the landowners, allowing loggers of state-owned timber to use the road, the state never intended to create any greater public right to the road than was granted by the owners and law regarding recorded and worked highways did not apply.

        Where the record did not reflect that the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) followed the statutory procedure to abandon highway where accident occurred killing plaintiff’s son, even though it had not been used by the ITD for more than 30 years, a question of material fact as to whether the ITD properly abandoned such highway existed and trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the ITD. Dachlet v. State, 130 Idaho 204, 938 P.2d 1242 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly granted a motion for summary judgment under Idaho R. Civ. P. 56(c) in a case involving a dispute over the alleged abandonment of a boundary road where two neighbors and others established that the road had not received any public use or maintenance over the last five years. John W. Brown Props. v. Blaine County, 138 Idaho 171, 59 P.3d 976 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an owner’s affidavits concerning the use and maintenance of a gravel road were general and conclusory, they did not set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial, as required by Idaho R. Civ. P. 56(e). John W. Brown Props. v. Blaine County, 138 Idaho 171, 59 P.3d 976 (2002).
       </p>

        Abandonment of a gravel road that had no public use or maintenance for five years did not result in landlocked property because the owner of the land was still permitted to use the road for access. John W. Brown Props. v. Blaine County, 138 Idaho 171, 59 P.3d 976 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because five years passed with no public use or maintenance on a gravel boundary road, the road ceased to be defined as a public road; the abandonment did not require any formal action by county commissioners. John W. Brown Props. v. Blaine County, 138 Idaho 171, 59 P.3d 976 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the court determined that a road was a public road and not abandoned prior to 1963, the procedures outlined in this section applied to any claims of abandonment between 1963 and 1998, and the trial court erred in finding otherwise. Farrell v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 138 Idaho 378, 64 P.3d 304 (2002), overruled on other grounds, City of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 277 P.3d 353 (2012).
    Bona fide purchaser for value defense was not available to defendant landowner in an action for injunctive relief to enforce a public right to way, because the defense would constitute an abandonment of a county road in contravention of this section.

        Lack of public use or maintenance for five years does not automatically terminate the public’s rights with respect to roads furnishing access to public lands or waters. Affirmative action by the county commissioners is required to abandon such roads. Blaine County v. Bryson, 109 Idaho 123, 705 P.2d 1078 (Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Roads that furnish public access to state or federal public lands or waters cannot be obstructed without first petitioning the county commissioners or highway district; the commissioners having jurisdiction must then take some affirmative action before abandonment is complete. French v. Sorensen, 113 Idaho 950, 751 P.2d 98 (1988), overruled on other grounds, Cardenas v. Kurpjuweit, 116 Idaho 739, 779 P.2d 414 (1989).

        Where property owner filed the action after a neighbor sought to block property owner’s use of the road by erecting a barricade and the highway district denied any relief to property owner, decision of the district court that the road was public and not abandoned as a public road by the highway district was correct; the road was not abandoned since, according to the requirements of the section prior to the 1986 amendment, the road was not established by prescription but rather by formal action of the then governing entity and the evidence indicated continued usage of the road to the present time, and since the highway district did not initiate any formal proceedings in conformance with the amended statute to withdraw the road in question from its highway district system.

       The state recognizes that the act of construction and first use constitute the acceptance of the grant given to the public for federal land rights-of-way, and that once acceptance of the grant has been established, the grant shall be for the perpetual term granted by the congress of the United States.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-204Aol12">
       The only method for the abandonment of these rights-of-way shall be that of eminent domain proceedings in which the taking of the public’s right to access shall be justly compensated. Neither the mere passage of time nor the frequency of use shall be considered a justification for considering these rights-of-way to have been abandoned.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-204Aol13">
       All of the said rights-of-way shall be shown by some form of documentation to have existed prior to the withdrawal of the federal grant in 1976 or to predate the removal of land through which they transit from the public domain for other public purposes. Documentation may take the form of a map, an affidavit, surveys, books or other historic information.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-204Aol14">
       These rights-of-way shall not require maintenance for the passage of vehicular traffic, nor shall any liability be incurred for injury or damage through a failure to maintain the access or to maintain any highway sign. These rights-of-way shall be traveled at the risk of the user and may be maintained by the public through usage by the public.

      <li id="t40c02s40-204Aol15">
       Any member of the public, the state of Idaho and any of its political subdivisions, and any agency of the federal government may choose to seek validation of its rights under law to use granted rights-of-way either through a process set forth by the state of Idaho, through processes set forth by any federal agency or by proclamation of user rights granted under the provisions of the original act, Revised Statute 2477.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-204Aol16">
       Persons seeking acknowledgement of federal land rights-of-way shall file with the county recorder the request for acknowledgement and for any supporting documentation. The county recorder shall record acknowledgements, including supporting documentation, and maintain an appropriate index of same.

     <p>
      Persons seeking to have a federal land right-of-way, including those which furnish public access to state and federal public lands and waters, validated as a highway or public right-of-way as part of a county or highway official highway system, shall follow the procedure outlined in section 40-203A, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither the granting of the original right-of-way nor any provision in this or any other state act shall be construed as a relinquishment of either federal ownership or management of the surface estate of the property over which the right-of-way passes.

       Any resident or property holder within the county or highway district system, including the state of Idaho or any of its subdivisions or any agency of the federal government, who is aggrieved by a final decision of a board of county or highway district commissioners in an abandonment and vacation or validation proceeding is entitled to judicial review under the provisions of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-208ol12">
       Proceedings for review are instituted by filing a petition in the district court of the county in which the commissioners have jurisdiction over the highway or public right-of-way within twenty-eight (28) days after the filing of the final decision of the commissioners or, if a rehearing is requested, within twenty-eight (28) days after the decision thereon.
      </li>

       The filing of the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the commissioners’ decision. The reviewing court may order a stay upon appropriate terms.

      <li id="t40c02s40-208ol14">
       Within thirty (30) days after the service of the petition, or within further time allowed by the court, the commissioners shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review. By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be ordered by the court to pay for additional costs. The court may require subsequent corrections to the record and may also require or permit additions to the record.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-208ol15">
       The parties may present additional evidence to the court, upon a showing to the court that such evidence is material to the issues presented to the court. In such case, the court may order that the additional information be presented to the commissioners upon conditions determined by the court. The commissioners may modify their findings and decisions by reason of the additional information and shall file that information and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-208ol16">
       Either party to a proceeding may request in writing that a judge who resides outside the county where the subject road or property is located be appointed to hear the case, and, upon such written request, such a judge shall be appointed for the case. The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury. The court shall consider the record before the board of county or highway district commissioners and shall defer to the board of county or highway district commissioners on matters in which such board has appropriately exercised its discretion with respect to the evaluation of the public interest. As to the determination of highway or public right-of-way creation, width and abandonment, the court may accept new evidence and testimony supplemental to the record provided by the county or highway district, and the court shall consider those issues anew. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the commissioners, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.

If the commissioners having jurisdiction over the highway system do not initiate a proceeding in response to such a petition within thirty (30) days, the person may seek a determination by quiet title or other available judicial means. When the legal status or width of a highway or public right-of-way is disputed and where a board of county or highway district commissioners wishes to determine the legal status or width of a highway or public right-of-way, the commissioners shall initiate validation or abandonment proceedings, or both, as provided for in sections 40-203 and 40-203A, Idaho Code, rather than initiating an action for quiet title. If proceedings pursuant to the provisions of section 40-203 or 40-203A, Idaho Code, are initiated, those proceedings and any appeal or remand therefrom shall provide the exclusive basis for determining the status and width of the highway, and no court shall have jurisdiction to determine the status or width of said highway except by way of judicial review provided for in this section.

During the 2012 interim session, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives established an Interim Task Force encompassing members of the Idaho Senate and the House of Representatives to further study these issues. On October 1, 2012, the Right-of-Way Task Force convened and accepted extensive testimony from stakeholders that included representatives of utility companies, counties and highway districts, irrigation districts and canal companies and various members of the public. It is further the intent of the Legislature to protect private property rights and ensure adequate public rights-of-way for transportation, utility and irrigation and other public facilities. It is the intent of the Legislature that this act shall apply to any and all existing and future highways and public rights-of-way and provide for an immediate implementation date due to the year delay in passing needed legislation, as a result of the yearlong task force efforts and the immediate need to provide clarity regarding the status or abandonment of highways and public rights-of-way.”

     <ol>
      <li id="t40c02s40-210ol11">
       Public highways are intended principally for public travel and transportation; however, the public highways and the public right-of-way used in connection with the public highways are also lawfully used in connection with uses associated with utility purposes necessary to provide utility services to the public. Without making use of public highways and their associated rights-of-way, the utility facilities and services could not reach or economically serve the residents of the state of Idaho.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-210ol12">
       In furtherance of the legislative intent expressed in subsection (1) of this section, public highway agencies engaged in a public highway project that may require the relocation of utility facilities, or any private party working with a public highway agency on a project that may require the relocation of utility facilities in connection therewith, shall permit the affected utility to participate in project development meetings. In addition, at the beginning of the preliminary design phase of the project, the public highway agency shall, upon giving written notice of not less than thirty (30) days to the affected utility, meet with the utility for the purpose of allowing the utility to review plans, understand the goals, objectives and funding sources for the proposed project, provide and discuss recommendations to the public highway agency that would reasonably eliminate or minimize utility relocation costs, limit the disruption of utility services, eliminate or reduce the need for present or future utility facility relocation, and provide reasonable schedules to enable coordination of the highway project construction and such utility facility relocation as may be necessary. While recognizing the essential goals and objectives of the public highway agency in proceeding with and completing a project, the parties shall use their best efforts to find ways to (a) eliminate the cost to the utility of relocation of the utility facilities, or (b) if elimination of such costs is not feasible, minimize the relocation costs to the maximum extent reasonably possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-210ol13">
       If a utility has received notice of the preliminary design meeting as set forth in subsection (2) of this section and has failed to respond or participate in meetings described therein, such failure to respond or participate in such meetings shall not in any way affect the ability of the public highway agencies to proceed with the project design or construction.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c02s40-210ol14">
       As used in this section:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t40c02s40-210ol14a">
         “Utility” means an entity comprised of any person, private company, public agency or cooperative owning and/or operating utility facilities.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c02s40-210ol14b">
         “Utility facility” means all privately, publicly or cooperatively owned lines, facilities and systems for producing, transmitting or distributing communications, cable television, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil, crude products, ore, water, steam, waste or storm water not connected with highway drainage and other similar commodities.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that the public highway agencies and utilities engage in proactive, cooperative coordination of highway projects through a process that will attempt to effectively minimize costs, limit the disruption of utility services, and limit or reduce the need for present or future relocation of such utility facilities.

         In determining which highways or section of highways shall be a part of the state highway system, the board shall consider the relative importance of each highway to cities, existing business, industry and enterprises and to the development of cities, natural resources, industry and agriculture and be guided by statistics on existing and projected traffic volumes. The board shall also consider the safety and convenience of highway users, the common welfare of the people of the state, and of the cities within the state and the financial capacity of the state of Idaho to acquire rights-of-way and to construct, reconstruct and maintain state highways. In making a determination, the board must, before it can abandon, relocate, or replace by a new highway, any highway serving or traversing any city, or the area in which the city is located, specifically find and determine that the benefits to the state of Idaho are greater than the economic loss and damage to the city affected. No highway serving or traversing any city shall be abandoned, relocated or replaced by a new highway serving the area in which a city is located without the board first holding a public hearing in that city. The abandonment shall proceed as set forth in section 40-203B, Idaho Code.

       <p>
        Unlike its designation of design, color, and word message, the DOT has determined that the size of a stop sign may be varied, and, in fact, should be where emphasis or visibility so requires; having adopted such a guideline, however, the department is bound to abide by it; therefore, the fact that the department erected a standard 30/ts30 inch stop sign at the intersection does not necessarily establish its fulfillment of its duty if, in fact, the department failed to exercise ordinary care in implementing its own policies and guidelines.

       <p>
        The power to determine when and how a developer may build an encroachment is implied from the Idaho Transportation Department’s (ITD) authority to regulate the design of public highways. A conditional permit allows the ITD to reserve the right to review construction plans to guarantee that applicants comply with the approved encroachment designs. The ITD’s regional departments use conditional permits to enforce highway-safety standards while assuring the applicant that he or she can develop detailed construction plans, obtain the necessary rights-of-way from other landowners, and undertake other final expenses.

        Where the legislature enacts a statute requiring that an administrative agency carry out specific functions, i.e., furnish, erect and maintain signs on side highways, that agency cannot validly subvert the legislation by promulgating contradictory rules; thus, although the legislature delegated some rule-making authority to the DOT to adopt specifications for a uniform system of traffic-control devices, the department was not, thereby, permitted to institute rules or policies limiting its ability to achieve its express statutory duties to place signs on side roads.

        In a prosecution against Indian tribe member for leaving the scene of an accident and for aggravated driving under the influence, where the defendant challenged the state’s jurisdiction over a section of U.S. Highway 95 that is within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, the trial court could have taken judicial notice of the “Official Highway Map” which the Idaho transportation department periodically issues and widely distributes for convenience of motorists; while these maps may not be conclusive on the subject of “principal” highways, they are reliable authority.

       </p>
       <p>
        An administrative agency may not alter, modify or diminish its statutorily-imposed responsibilities, either unilaterally or through agreement with another public or private entity, absent legislative authority to do so; thus, the fact that the county highway district had assumed part of the DOT’s legal obligations might affect the rights and liabilities between the department and the county highway district; however, such an agreement between these two entities does not alter the statutory duty owed by the department to the plaintiff involved in a car wreck. Roberts v. Reed, 121 Idaho 727, 827 P.2d 1178 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The DOT alone, has an express statutory duty with respect to erecting and maintaining signs at its highways’ intersections; the legislature in no way qualified this duty by the condition that the sign-placing or maintenance activities occur exclusively within boundaries of the state highway system; thus, contrary to the department’s position that it was without “jurisdiction” to place and maintain signs outside of its right-of-way, the department had both the authority and an express statutory duty to do so. Roberts v. Reed, 121 Idaho 727, 827 P.2d 1178 (Ct. App. 1991).

        The director of the Idaho transportation board had the power to sign an accelerated condemnation order on behalf of the board. The accelerated condemnation was properly conducted where the condemned property was valued relative to use as part of a highway widening and interchange; the valuation was not required to include potential increase in value from an unrelated proposed road extension project.

When the board determines that the topography of the land will not permit adequate screening of junkyards within one thousand (1,000) feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way of the highway on the interstate or primary system or the screening of the junkyards would not be economically feasible, the board must acquire by gift, purchase or the power of eminent domain, any interests necessary to secure the removal or disposal of the junkyard.

        Where the legislature enacts a statute requiring that an administrative agency carry out specific functions, i.e., furnish, erect and maintain signs on side highways, that agency cannot validly subvert the legislation by promulgating contradictory rules; thus, although the legislature delegated some rule-making authority to the DOT to adopt specifications for a uniform system of traffic-control devices, the department was not, thereby, permitted to institute rules or policies limiting its ability to achieve its express statutory duties to place signs on side roads.

       <p>
        An administrative agency may not alter, modify or diminish its statutorily-imposed responsibilities, either unilaterally or through agreement with another public or private entity, absent legislative authority to do so; thus, the fact that the county highway district had assumed part of the DOT’s legal obligations might affect the rights and liabilities between the department and the county highway district; however, such an agreement between these two entities does not alter the statutory duty owed by the department to the plaintiff involved in a car wreck. Roberts v. Reed, 121 Idaho 727, 827 P.2d 1178 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The DOT, alone, has an express statutory duty with respect to erecting and maintaining signs at its highways’ intersections; the legislature in no way qualified this duty by the condition that the sign-placing or maintenance activities occur exclusively within boundaries of the state highway system; thus, contrary to the department’s position that it was without “jurisdiction” to place and maintain signs outside of its right-of-way, the department had both the authority and an express statutory duty to do so.

       The legislature finds that the enactment into law by the U.S. congress of the REAL ID act of 2005, as part of public law 109-13, was adopted by the U.S. congress in violation of the principles of federalism contained in the 10th amendment to the constitution of the United States. The legislature reaffirms this position, while acknowledging that failure to implement certain provisions could adversely affect Idaho’s citizens and businesses. Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to continue to protect the privacy and security of the state’s residents.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2008, ch. 385 provided “The Second Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature hereby finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) In May of 2005, the U.S. Congress enacted the REAL ID Act of 2005 as part of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief Act (Public Law 109-13), which was signed by President George W. Bush on May 11, 2005, and which becomes fully effective May 11, 2008; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Some of the provisions of the REAL ID Act require states to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Issue a driver’s license or state identification card in a uniform format, containing uniform information, all as prescribed by the Department of Homeland Security;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Verify the issuance, validity and completeness of all primary documents used to issue a driver’s license, such as those showing that the bearer is a U.S. citizen or a lawful alien, a lawful refugee, or a person holding a valid visa;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Provide for secure storage of all primary documents that are used to issue a federally approved driver’s license or state identification card;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide fraudulent document recognition training to all persons engaged in issuing driver’s licenses or state identification cards; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) Issue a driver’s license or state identification card in a prescribed format if it is a license or card that does not meet the criteria provided for a federally approved license or identification card; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) Use of the federal minimum standards for state driver’s licenses and state-issued identification cards will be necessary for any type of federally regulated activity for which an identification card must be displayed, including flying in a commercial airplane, making transactions with a federally licensed bank, entering a federal building, or making application for federally supported public assistance benefits, including social security; and
    “(4) Some of the intended privacy requirements of the REAL ID Act, such as the use of common machine-readable technology and state maintenance of a database that can be shared with the United States and agencies of other states, may actually make it more likely that a federally required driver’s license or state identification card, or the information about the bearer on which the license or card is based, will be stolen, sold or otherwise used for purposes that were never intended or that are criminally related, than if the REAL ID Act had not been enacted; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) These potential breaches in privacy that could result directly from compliance with the REAL ID Act may violate the right to privacy of thousands of residents of Idaho; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has estimated the cost to implement the REAL ID Act to be $3.9 billion to the states and $5.8 billion to individuals, of which the U.S. Congress has pledged only $81.3 million, or less than 1% of the total cost; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) For all these reasons, seventeen states passed legislation opposing the REAL ID Act in 2007, including Idaho, which passed House Joint Memorial No. 3 declaring refusal to participate in the REAL ID program; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(8) The regulations that have been adopted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to implement the requirements of the REAL ID Act were issued in January of 2008, and pushed compliance with the REAL ID Act to 2014 for individuals born after 1964, and to 2017 for individuals born before 1964, undercutting any security rationale that might have existed for the original act; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(9) The final regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security fail to address the well known privacy problems with the REAL ID Act and in some cases, such as the issue of whether the machine-readable zone as encrypted may have exacerbated the problem; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(10) The federal government has been ineffective in stopping illegal immigration, resulting in millions of persons who are present in the United States of America without authorization; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(11) Securing our borders will greatly reduce the number of persons who enter our country without authorization and will do far more to provide security to our society than will increasing scrutiny on law-abiding American citizens by way of the REAL ID program; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(12) The mandate to the states, through federal legislation that provides no funding for its requirements, to issue what is, in effect, a national identification card, appears to be an attempt to ”commandeer“ the political machinery of the states and to require them to be agents of the federal government in violation of the principles of federalism contained in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as construed by the United States Supreme Court in New York v. United States, 488 U.S. 1041 (1992), United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), and Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997).”
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3 of S.L. 2008, ch. 385 provided that the act should take effect on and after July 1, 2008. Section 3 of S.L. 2008, ch. 385 further provided that if the United States Department of Homeland Security revises its final administrative regulation, 6 CFR Part 37, relating to the REAL ID, and the Governor of the State of Idaho subsequently determines that such revised final regulation is acceptable to the State of Idaho, by Executive Order the Governor may initiate implementation of REAL ID during the 2008 interim, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 40-322, Idaho Code. However, continued implementation of REAL ID shall be subject to the approval by the members of the First Regular Session of the Sixtieth Idaho Legislature. Such legislative approval shall be evidenced by the repeal of Section 40-322, Idaho Code.
    The words “this act”, as used in subsection (3), refer to S.L. 2008, Chapter 385, which appears in this section and in the notes thereto.

       The board is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the board for any of its corporate purposes, including the refunding of its bonds. The principal of and the interest on any issue of bonds shall be payable solely from and may be secured by a pledge of tolls and other revenues of all or any part of the turnpike project financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of the issue or with the proceeds of bonds refunded or to be refunded by the issue. The proceeds of the bonds may be used or pledged for the payment or security of the principal of or interest on bonds and for the establishment of any or all reserves for payment or security, or for other corporate purposes as the board may authorize in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or in a trust agreement securing them. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at a rate, shall mature at a time not exceeding thirty (30) years from their date, as may be determined by the board and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the board, at a price and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the board prior to the issuance of the bonds. The board shall determine the form of the bonds including any interest coupons to be attached, and shall fix the denomination of the bonds and the place of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the board or shall bear his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the board or a facsimile shall be impressed, imprinted, engraved or otherwise reproduced on them. The official seal or facsimile shall be attested by the secretary of the board or by other officer or agent as the board shall appoint and authorize. Any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the board. In the event any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until delivery. Bonds issued shall have and are declared to have all the qualifications and incidents of negotiable instruments. Bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The board may sell bonds in a manner and for a price, as it may determine to be for the best interest of the board. Neither the members of the board nor any person executing the bonds shall be personally liable on the bonds or be accountable by reason of the issuance of them.

       Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when those bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued without obtaining consent of any department, division, bureau, commission, board or agency of the state, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required.

       In the discretion of the board any bonds issued may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the board and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. A trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of bonds, subject to the provisions of section 40-412, Idaho Code, may pledge or assign tolls or other revenues to which the board’s right then exists or may subsequently come into existence, and moneys derived from them, and the proceeds of the bonds, but shall not convey or mortgage any turnpike project or any part of it. A trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of bonds may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of bondholders as may be reasonable and proper, and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the board in relation to the requisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of a turnpike project or projects, the rates of tolls and revenues to be charged, the payment, security or redemption of bonds, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and provisions for the employment of consulting engineers in connection with the construction or operation of a turnpike project or projects. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish indemnifying bonds or to pledge any securities as may be required by the board. A trust agreement or resolution may set forth rights and remedies of bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict individual rights of action by bondholders. In addition, a trust agreement or resolution may contain other provisions as the board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of a trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the turnpike project.

        This section was amended by two 1998 acts — ch. 154, § 1 and ch. 184, § 2, both effective July 1, 1998, which do not conflict and have been compiled together. However, the two acts added and redesignated subsections differently. The compiler has attempted to resolve these differences by letting stand the deletion of subsection (7) of ch. 154 and the accompanying redesignations of subsections (8) through (13) as subsections (7) through (12) and bracketing the addition of subsection (14) by ch. 184 as subsection [(13)].
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 154, § 1, deleted former subdivision (7), which read, “Let out by contract the improvement of highways, the construction and repair of bridges or other adjuncts to highways, when the amount of work to be done by contract exceeds five hundred dollars ($500). At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the fund collected in any highway division must be expended within the division in which the fund was collected,” redesignated the remaining subdivisions accordingly, inserted “(1)” in present subdivision (8), and hyphenated “right-of-way” throughout the section.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 184, § 2, in subdivision (8), inserted “(1),” added subdivision (14) (now [(13)]), and hyphenated “right-of-way” throughout the section.

        Where in an action by plaintiff residents of any unincorporated area of a county to have certain roads declared public highways and to require the county to maintain the roads, the evidence showed that the county had regularly maintained the roads for approximately nine years, that the roads had been extensively used by the general public, and that the sales of several lots within the area had been made with particular reliance upon several written representations made by various members of the board of county commissioners that the roads would be maintained by the county, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the county because a substantial fact issue existed as to whether the county had accepted the roads.

        Commissioners may lay out new highways within the county as they determine to be necessary.

Commissioners may also change the width or location or straighten lines of any highway under their jurisdiction. If, in the laying out, widening, changing or straightening of any highway it shall become necessary to take private property, the commissioners or their director of highways shall cause a survey of the proposed highway to be made, together with an accurate description of the lands required. The commissioners shall endeavor to agree with each owner for the purchase of a right-of-way over his land included within the description. If they are able to agree with the owner, the commissioners may purchase the land out of the county highway fund under their control, and the land shall then be conveyed to the county for the use and purpose of highways.

    The authority of the board of examiners as to claims based on an obligation authorized by the legislature against a specific appropriation made by the legislature was limited to determining whether the claims were in proper form, properly certified to the state auditor, whether chargeable against such appropriation, and whether there were funds remaining in the appropriation for such payment; the board cannot veto an act of the legislature or reverse the policy declared therein by refusing to approve claims properly presented.

       It is the declared policy of the legislature that, except as otherwise provided, all highway-user revenues accruing to the state highway account be spent exclusively for the maintenance, construction and development of highways and bridges in the state highway system. By mutual cooperative written agreements, or in the event of emergencies or other unusual circumstances where the financial or general welfare of the people is concerned, two (2) or more units of government may, upon a showing of cause declared and entered upon the minutes of an official meeting of the board, the boards of county, highway district commissioners or the governing body of any cities involved, as the case may be, share jointly the costs of the maintenance, construction or development of highways and bridges in any state, county, district or city system.

       All moneys apportioned to the board, counties or highway districts, and cities from the proceeds from the imposition of tax on fuels and from any tax or fee for the registration or operation of motor vehicles for general highway construction and maintenance, bridge and culvert moneys, shall be accounted for as to the actual expenditure to the state controller, as dedicated funds by a certification of the governing unit receiving, budgeting and expending those dedicated funds. The certification shall list the actual funds received for the budgetary period in each category of dedicated funds and the actual expenditure of the used dedicated funds. Any balance of dedicated funds unexpended must be shown and accounted for as a beginning balance in the next regular budget. The certification shall be prepared by the director, county auditor or highway district treasurer or city clerk, and shall be signed by the elected county or highway district commissioners, mayor, council, or board members of the respective reporting governmental unit. The certification shall be made by the 31st of December of each year for the preceding fiscal budget year, and shall be published once as a legal notice between January 1st and the 15th of January. Failure to make certification, failure to publish or the making of false statements in the certification shall subject the person so doing to the penalties prescribed in section 40-207, Idaho Code, or be used as the grounds for removal from office of the offending officials. The state controller is empowered to withhold the distribution of funds for noncompliance with the provisions of this section, but upon compliance shall authorize the distribution to be made.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c07s40-708ol13">

       Highway districts may accumulate fund balances at the end of a fiscal year and carry over those fund balances into the ensuing fiscal year sufficient to achieve or maintain highway district operations on a cash basis. A fund balance is the excess of the assets of a fund over its liabilities and reserves.

        Former law that provided for apportionment of funds to local units of government for highway purposes did not violate the constitutional provisions requiring every act to be plainly worded. Ada County v. Wright, 60 Idaho 394, 92 P.2d 134 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former law that provided for appropriation of funds to local units of government for highway purposes did not impose a liability on the state respecting moneys obtained from other source, being a specific appropriation from motor fuels tax. Ada County v. Wright, 60 Idaho 394, 92 P.2d 134 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former law that provided for apportionment of funds to local governmental units for highway purposes was not violative of the constitutional provision prohibiting the loaning of credit of the state of Idaho to any individual, association, or municipality, or other corporations. Ada County v. Wright, 60 Idaho 394, 92 P.2d 134 (1939).

       <p>
        Former law that provided for apportionment of funds to local governmental units for highway purposes was not violative of the constitutional inhibition against the legislature creating a liability against the state in excess of $2,000,000, since the statute is an appropriation and directs how the motor fuels tax shall be expended.

        Former law that provided for apportionment of funds to local governmental units for highway purposes concerned a distribution of an excise tax and did not impinge against the constitutional provision prohibiting the lawmakers from imposing taxes for county, city, town, or other municipal purposes, since that provision dealt only with ad valorem taxes. Ada County v. Wright, 60 Idaho 394, 92 P.2d 134 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former law that provided for apportionment of funds to local governmental units for highway purposes did not illegally or improperly divert state funds to other than state or public purposes, the building of highways being in the nature of a governmental function when conducted by the state in its sovereign capacity. Ada County v. Wright, 60 Idaho 394, 92 P.2d 134 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former law that provided for appropriation of funds to local governments for highway purposes did not direct a distribution of tax for county purposes, but merely directed the expenditures that may be made by counties and highway districts as state agencies, and was not violative of the constitutional provision inhibiting the lawmakers from imposing taxes for county or municipal purposes. Ada County v. Wright, 60 Idaho 394, 92 P.2d 134 (1939).
    The fact that the counties are not required to present claims to the state for their portion of the fund provided for in former law, to be passed upon by the board of examiners, did not violate a constitutional provision requiring claims against the state to be so passed upon.

In determining the reasonableness of the subject county or highway district’s actions with respect to the highway, the Idaho transportation board shall take into account the authority of the county or highway district to temporarily close a highway, the availability of funding and other considerations addressed in sections 40-1311 and 40-1315, Idaho Code.

A request for termination shall be accompanied by appropriate documentation showing that the requesting entity is prepared to resume its maintenance responsibility for the highway. The Idaho transportation board shall consider the request for termination or modification, taking into account the information presented by the requesting entity and any other information available to the Idaho transportation board. If the Idaho transportation board determines that the concerns giving rise to the petition have been addressed and the entity is committed to resume maintenance of the highway, the Idaho transportation board shall terminate its prior action and allow the entity to resume responsibility for maintenance of the highway upon the beginning of the next fiscal year.

       Within ten (10) days after the organization of a highway board, it shall be the duty of the commissioners to pay over to the treasurer of the highway district the proper share of the district’s funds in the highway and bridge fund of the county, the share being ascertained and determined as follows: From the total amount of the highway and bridge funds, consisting of the balance, if any, on hand at the beginning of the current calendar year, augmented by the amount of whatever taxes may have been subsequently collected and paid into the highway and bridge funds, there shall be deducted the amount of any payments made from the funds since the beginning of the calendar year and also any amount needed to make good any deficiency in the funds that may have existed at the beginning of that year. The resulting amount is, for the purpose of the computation, termed the net highway and bridge fund. The highway district’s contribution to it is an amount which bears the same ratio that the amount of the highway and bridge ad valorem taxes levied by the county within the highway district in the preceding year (less twenty-five per cent (25%) of the highway fund levied within any included cities), bears to the total amount of highway and bridge ad valorem taxes levied in the county in the preceding year. The proper share for the highway district in the highway and bridge fund is, for the purpose of this section, ninety-five per cent (95%) of the highway district’s contribution to the net highway and bridge fund.

      <li id="t40c07s40-711ol13">
       Pending final adjustment and payment of the amounts provided for in this section, the commissioners are authorized to retain a proportion of the funds as shall be required to meet outstanding valid warrants lawfully issued against the county prior to the organization of the highway district and outstanding indebtedness of the county lawfully contracted prior to the organization of the highway district lawfully chargeable and payable out of those funds. This section shall not apply to the proceeds of taxes specially levied to meet the requirements of bonds issued by the county.

      § 40-808. Creation of special tax districts — Apportionment of costs.
     </h3>
     <p>
      As a highway is built and completed with the proceeds of a bond issue within an area of land which under a resolution of a highway district board is provided, there may be created a special tax district. When the highway has been accepted by the highway district board, and the director of highways for the district has certified to his board the cost of the highway so far as it lies within the special tax district, then the highway district board shall, by order, create a special tax district, fix and designate the boundaries of it, and designate the portion of the cost of the highway to be charged against the land in the special tax district, not exceeding the maximum percentage specified in the original resolution. The highway district board shall fix and determine the amount per acre charged against the lands within the special tax district, not exceeding, in respect to any single highway, the maximum amount per acre specified for the highway in the original resolution. The amount per acre need not be the precise proportionate cost of the highway, but may be the approximate proportion, avoiding inconvenient fractions or fractional parts of a dollar, and shall be the same uniform amount per acre throughout any single special tax district. The highway district board shall include as part of the cost of the highway the fair and reasonable portion of overhead charges applicable, and an additional amount equal to two per cent (2%) of the cost to cover the expenses of the highway district for the collection of the special taxes. From time to time as highways or portions of highways are completed and accepted and the cost certified, the highway district board shall create the proper tax districts. In respect to each special tax district created, the highway board is constituted the local executive authority of each special tax district with authority in respect to each district, to levy the special tax, the authority being confined in each district to the limits of the highway district, and within the limits the special tax in each special tax district shall be at a uniform amount per acre throughout the special tax district. The order of the highway district board creating the special tax district, fixing and determining its boundaries, stating the number of acres in it, fixing the amount of the indebtedness created by the bond issue which is charged against the land in the special tax district, and the amount per acre to be specially taxed against the land shall be entered at length on the minutes of the highway district board and shall be open to public inspection. A notice stating generally the nature and date of the order and designating the township and sections within the special tax district shall be published for at least two (2) separate times in a newspaper published in the county. On the filing with the secretary of the highway district of proof of publication, the order shall be deemed complete.

       <p>
        Within thirty (30) days after the filing provided for in section 40-808, Idaho Code, but not after the expiration of the thirty (30) days, any owner of land within a special taxing district may file in the office of the highway district board a copy of a verified petition in a proceeding in the district court of the highway district for the review of the order, specifying the grounds of objection. At the expiration of the thirty (30) days, all proceedings relating to the special tax district where copies of petitions for review have been duly filed shall be consolidated by order of the district court into a single proceeding, and notice shall be given and procedure followed as the district court shall prescribe. The district court shall have jurisdiction as a court of equity, and without a jury, try and determine the proceeding. On the review, the only question to be tried and determined shall be whether, in creating a special tax district and in fixing the amounts so charged against the land, the district board has observed the requirements specified in sections 40-810 and 40-811, Idaho Code. The district court shall, if it determines that the board has materially departed from the requirements, make a final order in the proceeding directing any necessary change or modification in the order of the highway district board, and that board shall make the changes and modifications in their order, and the changed or modified order shall be submitted to the district court and finally made as directed and approved by the court. If in the proceeding the district court shall determine that the highway board has not materially departed from the requirements, it shall affirm the order of the highway district board. On the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the highway district board’s original order, without any copy of a petition for review having been filed, or on the filing with the secretary of the highway board, of the order of the district court in the proceeding for review affirming the order, or on the filing with the secretary of the new order of the board embodying the changes and modifications directed by the district court in the proceeding for review, with the written approval of the court attached, as the case may be, the order shall be final and conclusive in respect to all the matters and things contained.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When an order of the highway district board has become final and conclusive, the board shall levy upon all the land within the special tax district created by the order a special tax equal in amount to the amount so charged in the order against the special tax district, specifying the amount per acre. The secretary of the district shall transmit to the assessor and tax collector of the county a certified copy of the levy and of the order creating the special tax district. On receiving the certified copy, the county assessor shall assess, against the land in the special tax district, the amount levied, but it shall not be collected except as installments as shall be called for by the annual levies made by the highway district board of the taxes necessary to meet the requirements of the bonds. The existence of an assessment against land in the special tax district shall not be held to constitute a cloud upon the title of that land, nor as a breach of a convenant [covenant] of warranty, title, nor against encumbrances in a deed or contract for the land, nor as rendering the title to the land unmarketable. The special tax authorized within special tax districts is a tax for the purpose of securing for the special tax districts the benefit of local highways within the limits of the special tax district, as distinguished from the general purpose of the bond issue as a whole of securing the benefit of a system of highways for the highway district at large.

        § 40-811. Limitations on levy in special tax districts.
       </h3>
       <p>
        No special tax or charge shall be made by a highway district against land within a special tax district until the highway has been completed to within at least one (1) mile of all the land within the special tax district, the highway has been accepted by the district board, the cost certified, and all the proceedings taken as specified. All interest payable on the bonds up to that time shall be paid by the highway district without imposing on the special tax district a special tax other than its share in the taxation of the highway district as a whole. After the special tax has been levied the highway district board shall in each year, at the same time of the tax levy to meet the interest requirements of bonds, also levy a special tax on the land within every special tax district then created, in an amount sufficient to pay the interest for that year on the portion of the bond issue, the indebtedness which shall have been charged against the special tax district. Whenever the highway district board shall levy a tax to meet any principal or sinking fund requirement of the bonds, they shall at the same time levy a special tax on the land within every special tax district an amount sufficient to pay the principal or sinking fund requirements for that year on the portion of the bond issue, the indebtedness of which shall have been charged against the special tax district. All special taxation within any single special tax district shall be of a uniform amount per acre within the special tax district. Each installment of principal or sinking fund tax collected from the taxation of any land within a special tax district shall be credited on the original assessment of special tax made, and where all the installments shall have been paid, the special assessment shall be deemed canceled, paid and discharged. No special tax district shall ever be called upon to pay as special taxes any sum greater than the amount charged against the district or the land in the original special assessment and proportionate share of interest. In making the levy for the requirements of the bonds, the highway district board shall levy on the district at large only an amount of taxes in each year as shall be required to meet the requirements for that year of that portion of the bond issue which has not been charged against the special tax districts. Should the levy together with the levies on special tax districts in any year fail to produce sufficient funds to meet the obligation of the highway district on the whole issue, then the deficiency shall be paid out of the other revenues of the highway district, and if necessary, the bond levy shall be increased in the following year to make good that deficiency. No failure or delay on the part of the highway district in imposing, levying or collecting the special taxes shall, as between the district and the bondholders, impair the obligation of the highway district upon the whole of the bonds.

When all of the territory of a county is included in one or more highway districts the commissioners shall not regulate, fix or levy any tax for highway or bridge purposes.

     <p>
      Upon receiving a certified copy of a resolution of a highway district board, the county assessor must assess upon all property in the highway district subject to taxation the taxes so levied and certified to him. His assessment of all taxes levied by the highway district board may be computed and made upon the valuation of property as fixed by the board of equalization for county purposes, and as appears upon the assessment roll in the same year. The taxes as levied by the highway district board shall become a lien upon the property assessed from the date of the assessment, and shall be due and payable at the same time as other county taxes, and in all respects are to be collected in the same way, except that the tax collector must keep a separate list or assessment roll of them, and when paid, they must be named in his receipt to the taxpayer as a separate item. The tax collector shall pay the taxes, when collected, to the treasurer of the highway district and at the time of payment he must specify to the treasurer receiving them what taxes they are, take a separate receipt and keep separate accounts for the payment of the tax. The commissioners shall furnish the tax collector with any blanks as are needed to comply with these provisions.

Where an election is required under the provisions of article VIII of the Idaho constitution to authorize a bond issue, the election may be held with other elections. Elections shall be conducted by the county clerk in the same manner as county elections pursuant to title 34, Idaho Code. Authorization for the issuance, sale and redemption of bonds other than funding or refunding existing indebtedness, shall be as provided by chapter 2, title 57, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Should any bond issue where the indebtedness has been charged in part against adjoining property be funded or refunded so that a sinking fund for the original issue is not required to be established, then the annual levy for sinking fund requirements need not be made upon the land in the special tax districts created in respect to the bond issue; or, at the option of the highway district commissioners, a portion of the bond issue, to meet a sufficient amount which has been charged against the special tax districts, may remain without refunding, and shall subsequently be paid and retired with the proceeds of the special taxes on the land within the special tax districts. If the proceeds prove temporarily insufficient, then they shall be paid from the other revenues of the district. If the whole of an issue is refunded and new bonds issued, then the land within the special tax districts shall continue to be specially taxed for the new bonds, equal in amount to the refunding issue equably, both as to principal and interest, with the taxation of the district at large for the bond purposes. On the funding of any issue of bonds, on receiving from the treasurer of the district a certificate, under the seal of the district, signed by the secretary and treasurer of the district and either by the chairman or by the other highway district commissioners that the bonds have been actually funded and retired, the special assessment made against the land within the special tax districts created for the bond issue as provided in section 40-810, Idaho Code, shall be canceled, vacated and annulled, and a new special levy of the same amount shall be assessed against the land in the special tax districts in respect to the new or refunding bonds.

       <p>
        The contracts, obligations and liabilities validated by former law that provided for ratification of prior contracts, obligations, liabilities and judgments were the contracts and obligations entered into and liabilities incurred in the conduct of the principal business for which highway districts are organized. Filer Hwy. Dist. ex rel. Alworth v. Shearer, 54 Idaho 201, 30 P.2d 199 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was not the hint in the provisions of former law that provided for ratification of prior contracts, obligations, liabilities and judgments that the legislature intended to validate the purchase of land bank bonds, by the highway district, with sinking funds. Filer Hwy. Dist. ex rel. Alworth v. Shearer, 54 Idaho 201, 30 P.2d 199 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since former law that provided for ratification of prior contracts, obligations, liabilities and judgments did not in any manner validate the purchase of land bank bonds, it follows that such section could not cure a defective notice to taxpayers of such purchase so as to invoke the statute of limitations so as to bar an action by the latter, attacking such purchase, more than three (3) years thereafter.

Personal or real property, no longer useful to the district, not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in value may be sold by the highway commissioners at a private sale or at any regular board meeting without advertisement. Before disposing of all other personal or real property exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in value, the highway district commissioners shall first conduct a public hearing for which notice shall be published in accordance with the provisions of section 40-206, Idaho Code, and at which hearing any person interested may appear and show cause that such personal or real property is still useful to the district and that the sale or exchange should not be made. Following testimony by all interested persons at the public hearing, the highway district commissioners may adopt a resolution finding that such personal or real property is no longer useful to the district and finding that such personal or real property should be sold or exchanged and establishing procedures for the sale of such personal or real property including, but not limited to, the date and time of the sale and whether the sale will be by live public auction, by receipt of sealed bids or by some other reasonably commercial means. The hearing and sale or exchange shall not be conducted at the same regular meeting and, except as otherwise provided by law, the only notice required for such sale or exchange shall be as set forth in section 74-204, Idaho Code. Provided however, that before the district disposes of surplus real property at public sale, the district shall first notify any person who owns real property that is contiguous with the surplus real property of the district that such person has first option to purchase the surplus real property for an amount not less than the current appraised value. If more than one (1) adjoining owner wants to purchase the surplus real property, a private auction shall be held for such parties. If no owner of adjoining property exercises his or her option to buy, the district may proceed to public sale. Highway district commissioners, highway directors, employees, and their families must be personally disinterested, directly or indirectly, in the purchase of property for the use of the highway district, or in the sale of any property belonging to the highway district, or in any contract made by the highway district or other person on behalf of the highway district unless otherwise authorized by law.

       </h3>
       <ol>
        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol11">
         The commissioners of a highway district have exclusive general supervision and jurisdiction over all highways and public rights-of-way within their highway system, with full power to construct, maintain, repair, acquire, purchase and improve all highways within their highway system, whether directly or by their own agents and employees or by contract. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter in respect to the highways within their highway system, a highway district shall have all of the powers and duties that would by law be vested in the commissioners of the county and in the district directors of highways if the highway district had not been organized. Where any highway within the limits of the highway district has been designated as a state highway, then the board shall have exclusive supervision, jurisdiction and control over the designation, location, maintenance, repair and reconstruction of it. The highway district shall have power to manage and conduct the business and affairs of the district; establish and post speed and other regulatory signs; make and execute all necessary contracts; have an office and employ and appoint agents, attorneys, officers and employees as may be required, and prescribe their duties and fix their compensation. Highway district commissioners and their agents and employees have the right to enter upon any lands to make a survey, and may locate the necessary works on the line of any highways on any land which may be deemed best for the location.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol12">
         The highway district shall also have the right to acquire either by purchase, or other legal means, all lands and other property necessary for the construction, use, maintenance, repair and improvement of highways in their system. The highway district may change the width or location, or straighten lines of any highway in their system, and if in the constructing, laying out, widening, changing, or straightening of any highways, it shall become necessary to take private property, the district director of highways, with the consent and on order of the highway district commissioners, shall cause a survey of the proposed highway to be made, together with an accurate description of the lands required. He shall endeavor to agree with each owner of property for the purchase of a right-of-way over the lands included within the description. If the director is able to agree with the owner of the lands, the highway district commissioners may purchase the land and pay for it out of the funds of the highway district, and the lands purchased shall then be conveyed to the highway district for the use and purpose of highways.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol13">
         Whenever the director of highways shall be unable to agree with any person for the purchase of land, or that person shall be unknown or a nonresident of the county in which the highway district is situated, or a minor, or an insane or incompetent person, the director shall have the right, subject to the order of the highway district commissioners, to begin action in the name of the highway district in the district court of the county in which the district is situated, to condemn the land necessary for the right-of-way for the highway, under the provisions of chapter 7, title 7, Idaho Code. An order of the highway district commissioners entered upon its minutes that the land sought to be condemned is necessary for a public highway and public use shall be prima facie evidence of the fact.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol14">
         The highway district has the power to contract for and pay out any special rewards and bounties as may appear expedient or useful in securing proper highway construction and maintenance, and to accept, on behalf of the district, aid or contributions in the construction or maintenance of any highway; to construct or repair, with the consent of the corporate authorities of any city within the district, any highway within a city, upon the division of the cost as may be agreed upon; or to join with the state or any body politic or political subdivision, or with any person in the construction or repair of any highway and to contract for an equitable division of the cost; and all counties, cities, highway districts and other bodies politic and political subdivisions are authorized to contract with any highway district acting through its highway district commissioners in exercise of the powers granted.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol15">
         The highway district has the power to receive highway petitions and lay out, alter, create and abandon and vacate public highways and public rights-of-way within their respective districts under the provisions of sections 40-202, 40-203 and 40-203A, Idaho Code. Provided however, when a public highway, public street and/or public right-of-way is part of a platted subdivision which lies within an established county/city impact area or within one (1) mile of a city if a county/city impact area has not been established, consent of the city council of the affected city, when the city has a functioning street department with jurisdiction over the city streets, shall be necessary prior to the granting of acceptance or vacation of said public street or public right-of-way by the highway district board of commissioners.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol16">
         The highway district is empowered to take conveyance or other assurances, in the name of the highway district, for all property acquired by it under the provisions of this chapter for the purposes of this title. The highway district may institute and maintain any and all actions and proceedings, suits at law and in equity, necessary or proper in order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, or to enforce, maintain, protect or preserve any and all rights, privileges and immunities provided in this chapter. In all courts, actions, suits or proceedings, the highway district may sue, appear and defend, in person or by attorneys, and in the name of the highway district.

        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol17">
         The highway district is empowered to hold, use, acquire, sell, manage, occupy and possess property. The highway district may create highway subdistricts, which must be carefully and distinctly defined and described. Highway subdistricts may be revised or modified by the highway district commissioners, as changes in conditions demand.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c13s40-1310ol18">
         The highway district board of commissioners shall have the exclusive general supervisory authority over all public highways, public streets and public rights-of-way under their jurisdiction, with full power to establish design standards, establish use standards, pass resolutions and establish regulations in accordance with the provisions of title 49, Idaho Code, and control access to said public highways, public streets and public rights-of-way.

         By July 1, 2000, and every five (5) years thereafter, the highway district board of commissioners shall have published in map form and made readily available the location of all public rights-of-way under its jurisdiction. Any highway district board of commissioners may be granted an extension of time with the approval of the legislature by adoption of a concurrent resolution.

    (10) In its discretion, the highway district may purchase equipment at a public auction, if the highway district board of commissioners has made a finding that such equipment may be purchased at a competitive price. Prior to the public auction, the highway district commissioners shall, at a regular meeting of the district or at a special hearing, notice of which is published in accordance with the provisions of section 40-206, Idaho Code, review any documentation available as to the items to be auctioned at the public sale and determine which items the district may bid on, and establish a maximum amount the district will bid for such item.

        Under the provisions of former law that provided that powers granted to highway districts be liberally construed, the board of commissioners was acting within the scope of its powers in directing its secretary to make reports in conformity with former laws regarding general powers of commissioners and requirement of annual report and financial statement, and in subsequently ratifying such reports which then became reports of the board not subject to attack.

        Where improvements were made for the benefit of highway district and territory of county not included within such district, and it would have been unjust for the excluded territory to assume the whole burden of the cost of the improvement, the district and board of county commissioners were given the power to contract each with the other for a division of the costs. Reinhart v. Canyon County, 22 Idaho 348, 125 P. 791 (1912).
    The provisions of former law regarding costs of highways and an equitable division among benefited districts of such costs and the relief afforded thereunder did not apply where the improvements made by a county were wholly beyond the boundaries of the highway district, and it was not claimed, in the action seeking contribution, that the costs were an unjust burden on the county.

       The commissioners of a county-wide highway district may pass ordinances, rules, and make all regulations, not repugnant to law, as necessary, for carrying into effect or discharging all powers and duties conferred to a county-wide highway district pursuant to this chapter and chapter 13 of this title. All ordinances created or passed by the commissioners of a county-wide highway district shall require the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the full county-wide highway district commission. The style of all ordinances shall be: “BE IT ORDAINED by the board of highway district commissioners of (. . . . . . . .) County, Idaho.” All ordinances passed shall, before they take effect and within one (1) month after they are passed, be published in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper published in the county or, if no paper be published in the county, then in some paper having general circulation therein. After such publication and before its effective date, such proposed ordinance shall not thereafter be amended in any particular wherein the amendment shall impose terms, conditions or privileges less favorable to the county-wide highway district than the proposed ordinance as published; but amendment favorable to the county-wide highway district may be made at any time and after publication. All ordinances passed pursuant to this section by the board of county-wide highway district commissioners may be proved by a certificate of the secretary of the county-wide highway district under the seal of the board of the county-wide highway district commissioners and shall be read and received in evidence in all courts and administrative proceedings without further proof. If ordinances duly passed are printed or published in book or pamphlet form by authority of the county-wide highway district commissioners, the printed or published book or pamphlet shall also be read and received in evidence in all courts and administrative proceedings without further proof. The commissioners of the county-wide highway district may enforce such ordinances by all appropriate administrative or judicial proceedings. History.

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section cannot be construed to suggest that the legislature bestowed authority on a highway district to grant franchises to public utilities; such an interpretation is clearly contrary to the grant of powers given to the highway districts by the legislature. Alpert v. Boise Water Corp., 118 Idaho 136, 795 P.2d 298 (1990).

        Utility Franchises.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The highway district legislation contained in title 40, chapter 13, and this chapter, does not supersede the well-established law vesting power to grant franchises to utilities in the cities. Alpert v. Boise Water Corp., 118 Idaho 136, 795 P.2d 298 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Highway district’s reliance upon this section as the basis for asserting that it supersedes the law controlling utility franchises is misplaced, as the language of this section is primarily in reference to imposition of ad valorem taxes and cannot be extended to replace the constitutional and statutory provisions controlling utility franchises. Alpert v. Boise Water Corp., 118 Idaho 136, 795 P.2d 298 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is undisputed that municipal corporations have the power to operate their own utility systems and provide water, power, light, gas and other utility services within the city limits, and the constitutional and statutory grant of franchise authority to the cities in this respect is not nullified or altered by this section. Alpert v. Boise Water Corp., 118 Idaho 136, 795 P.2d 298 (1990).

The authorization to adopt, implement, and collect a vehicle registration fee may be made by the registered voters of the county only at a general election held in even-numbered years, and a simple majority of the votes cast on the question shall be necessary to authorize the fee.

      § 40-1517. Funding of indebtedness of former highway districts.
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the consolidated highway district commissioners determine that valid outstanding indebtedness of any of the former highway districts, existing prior to the consolidation may be funded or refunded to the profit and benefit of the taxpayers within the boundaries of the former highway district, and without incurring any additional liability, the highway commissioners have the power and authority to make provision for issuing of funding or refunding bonds in an amount equal to the unpaid principal and interest on the outstanding bonds or other indebtedness. Before the highway commissioners shall issue any bonds to refund any outstanding indebtedness, it shall cause all moneys of the former highway district on hand available for the payment and discharge of any indebtedness to be applied in payment and discharge of them and issue funding or refunding bonds only for the remainder of the indebtedness. The issuance of bonds shall not create any liability against the consolidated highway district or any of the property within its boundaries, excepting that the property within the boundaries of the former highway district shall be liable for the payment of the bonds.

        Where a new highway district was formed out of territory in another district, it was the duty of the commissioners to levy a tax on the annual assessed valuation of the old districts, and not on the assessed valuation at the time of the formation of the new district; such levy was for the purpose of payment of the bonded indebtedness of the old district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The detachment of territory from the district shall be deemed to relate only to the operations of the district subsequent to the order of detachment. Territory detached and all taxable property in that territory shall be and remain liable for the proportionate share of all bonded, warrant, and other indebtedness incurred by the district prior to the time of detachment. The proportionate share of the indebtedness of the district incurred prior to the order of detachment to be borne by the detached territory is hereby established and shall be determined and computed as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t40c16s40-1609ol11">
       The highway district commissioners shall, at the meeting at which an order of detachment is made, compute the total aggregate market value for assessment purposes of the property within the district for the preceding year, and shall separately compute the total aggregate market value for assessment purposes for the preceding year of all the property within the territory detached from the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c16s40-1609ol12">
       The highway district commissioners shall compute and determine as of the date of the order of detachment the cash and solvent credits owing to the district and the value of the highway equipment and other personal property owned by it at the time of the detachment of territory, all of which property shall be retained by the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c16s40-1609ol13">
       The proportion of the outstanding indebtedness of the district incurred prior to the withdrawal of territory for which the withdrawn territory shall be and remain liable is the proportion that the aggregate market value for assessment purposes of the property within the withdrawn territory bears to the market value for assessment purposes of the property within the entire highway district as shown by the assessment rolls of the preceding year, less credit for the proportionate share or interest of the withdrawn territory in the cash, solvent credits, and personal property of the district, that share being based upon the proportion that the market value for assessment purposes of the property within the detached territory for the preceding year bears to the market value for assessment purposes of the total property within the entire district for the year.

At the hearing any person objecting may be heard in opposition, and upon the closing of the hearing, the commissioners shall within ten (10) days after the hearing, notify the districts affected of their decision, and any district aggrieved by the decision shall have the right through its highway commissioners to appeal the decision directly to the district court of the county in which the district lies. Matters referred to the district court on appeal shall be submitted by petition for hearing within twenty (20) days of the announcement of the decision of the commissioners and the matter disposed of by the district court by reversal or approval. Failure to diligently prosecute the matter before the district court shall justify the district court in dismissing the appeal without hearing.

        County commissioners did not err in holding a highway district should dissolve because the “best interest of district” was considered something more than just the corporate entity and meant taking into account consideration of geographical area and the interests of persons the district was intended to serve; however, the city could not be the highway district’s successor.

In order to provide for maximum visibility along highways and to permit unobstructed view of connecting highways and intersections, to prevent the distraction of operators of motor vehicles, to prevent confusion with respect to traffic lights, signs or signals, or otherwise interfere with the effectiveness of traffic regulations, to preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty of areas traversed by interstate and primary highways, to protect the public investment in highways, to promote the recreational value of public travel, to conform to the expressed intent of congress to control the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising displays, and to promote the maximum safety, comfort and well-being, of the users of highways, the legislature finds and declares it to be necessary in the public interest to regulate the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising structures, signs and displays and the business or occupation, in areas adjacent to interstate and primary highways, in accordance with the terms of this chapter and regulations promulgated by the board.

     <p>
      The legislature finds and declares that the prompt and equitable relocation and reestablishment of persons, families, businesses, farmers, and nonprofit organizations displaced as a result of any state or local governmental program or project is a necessary purpose, is a cost of those programs and projects and is a public purpose. In order to insure that individuals do not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole the legislature declares that relocation payments and relocation advisory assistance shall be provided to all persons so displaced in accordance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and rules promulgated by the board. The legislature finds and declares that rent supplement or purchase assistance payments to tenants and relocation payments to owner-occupants, businesses, and farmers in accordance with the provisions of this chapter are a public purpose and are necessary to enable all displaced persons to obtain decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings. The legislature further declares the provisions of this chapter may be applicable to all programs.

       In addition to the payments authorized by section 40-2004, Idaho Code, an agency shall make a payment to the owner of a dwelling, provided the dwelling has been owned and occupied by the owner for at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the first written offer for the acquisition of the property. The payment shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and shall be the amount, which, when added to the acquisition payment, equals the reasonable cost required for a comparable dwelling determined in accordance with standards established by the agency to be suitable to accommodate the displaced owner. The payment shall be made only to a displaced owner who purchases and occupies a dwelling that meets standards established by the agency, not later than the end of a one (1) year period beginning on the date on which he received final payment of all costs of the acquired dwelling, or on the date on which he moves from the acquired dwelling, whichever is the later date. Payment under this subsection will include an amount which will compensate the displaced person for any increased interest costs which the person is required to pay for financing the acquisition of any comparable replacement dwelling. This amount will be paid only if the dwelling acquired by the agency was encumbered by a mortgage which was a valid lien on the dwelling for not less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the first written offer for the acquisition of the dwelling. The amount shall be equal to the excess in the aggregate interest and other debt service costs of that amount of the principal of the mortgage on the replacement dwelling which is equal to the unpaid balance of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, over the remainder term of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, reduced to discounted current value. The discounted rate shall be the prevailing interest rate paid on savings deposits by commercial banks in the general area in which the replacement dwelling is located. This amount shall also include reasonable expenses incurred by the displaced person for evidence of title, recording fees, and other closing costs incident to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, but shall not include prepaid expenses.

      It is hereby recognized by the legislature of the state of Idaho that, as the population and economy of areas of this state grow, the total needs for mobility of commerce and people cannot be met solely with highway and road systems; that motor vehicle congestion and air quality problems result which may adversely affect health and safety; that there are a variety of persons who are elderly, who have disabilities, who live in rural areas or who otherwise require public transportation services for their general welfare; and that prosperous commerce and industry depend upon effective regional systems of transportation. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the state to maintain a state commitment to improve public transportation; to increase the use of transportation alternatives to single occupancy motor vehicles; to promote cooperative agreements among governmental entities in providing public transportation services; and to attain greater efficiency in the use of public transportation funds in a manner consistent with the needs, health, safety and general welfare of the people of Idaho.

      It is hereby found, determined and declared that the creation of a regional public transportation authority is in all respects for the benefit of the people of the state of Idaho, for the improvement of their welfare and prosperity, and for the promotion of their transportation, and is a public purpose and that projects and services operated by authorities are essential parts of the public transportation system, and that such authorities will be performing essential governmental functions in the exercise of the powers conferred upon them by this chapter. The state of Idaho declares that authorities shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired by them or under their respective jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or upon the activities of authorities in the operation and maintenance of projects and services, or upon any charges, fees, revenues, or other income received by authorities, or upon special fuels used in motor vehicles owned or leased and operated by authorities, and that the bonds of authorities and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation. Regional public transportation authorities created pursuant to this chapter shall be exempt from the sales tax imposed under the provisions of section 63-3621, Idaho Code, shall be issued a tax exemption certificate as provided for in section 63-3622, Idaho Code, and shall be entitled to such credits and refunds as other political subdivisions of the state of Idaho are entitled under section 63-2423, Idaho Code.

      § 40-2318. Turning highways across private lands.
     </h3>
     <p>
      If any person, through whose land any public highway is established, is desirous of turning the highway through any other part of his land, that person may, by petition, apply to the appropriate commissioners to permit him to turn the highway through another part of his land without materially increasing the distance of travel to the public. Upon receipt of a petition, accompanied by a sufficient bond to pay the cost and expense to be incurred, the appropriate commissioners may appoint three (3) disinterested viewers and a surveyor, if they deem it necessary, who shall view the ground over which the highway is proposed to be turned, and ascertain the distance the highway will be increased by the proposed alteration, and report in writing stating the several distances found, together with their opinion as to the usefulness of making the alterations. If the viewers report to the respective commissioners that the prayer of the petitioner is reasonable, the respective commissioners upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the proposed new highway has been opened a legal width, and in all respects made equal to the old highway for the convenience of travelers, may declare the new highway a public highway, make record of it, and at the same time vacate so much of the old highway as is embraced in the new. The person petitioning for the alteration shall pay all costs and expense of the view and survey, if ordered. When any person wishes to change the line or location of any public highway, he shall cause notice of his intention to apply to the appropriate commissioners having jurisdiction of the highway at its next session for permission to change the highway at his own expense, the notice to be in accordance with the provisions of section 40-206, Idaho Code, and shall also cause a copy of the notice to be posted at the post office, and at three (3) other public places in the county or district, at least twenty (20) days before the meeting of the respective commissioners. The notice must clearly show the proposed change or changes, and when, where, and by whom the petition will be presented, and at the time and place designated in the notice he must present his petition, which must conform to the notice. Any person objecting to the change may, within ten (10) days, file a protest in writing against it. Any person aggrieved by the action of the respective commissioners may appeal to the district court of the county in the same manner and with like effect as in other cases of appeal from the action of the respective commissioners.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person intending to run water across any public highway must first, under the direction and with the approval of the directors of highways of the county or district, or if the highway be the boundary of two (2) counties or districts, then, under the direction and with the approval of the director of highways of both counties or districts, construct a ditch of sufficient size to carry all the water, and must build a substantial bridge, with easy grades on and off the bridge over the ditch not less than sixteen (16) feet wide. When the quantity of water of any ditch is such that a pipe or culvert will carry the water, the water may be conducted across the highway by means of a pipe or culvert, which must be adapted to the surface of the highway, and the highest point of which shall be at least two (2) feet beneath the surface of the highway, be built of a length not less than sixteen (16) feet, and in a substantial manner permitting uninterrupted travel. All such bridges or culverts shall be of concrete, and all pipes of concrete, steel or other mineral substance. No wooden bridges, pipes or culverts shall be constructed, unless it appears to the satisfaction of the respective commissioners that the cost of the bridge, pipe or culvert would be unreasonably increased by being made of concrete, steel or other mineral substance, and that there is not sufficient travel over the highway to make it necessary for the protection and convenience of public travel that the bridge, pipe or culvert be constructed of those materials. The respective commissioners may in their discretion and by resolution, permit the bridge, pipe or culvert to be constructed of wood or other material, but no bridge, pipe or culvert shall be constructed of wood or any materials other than those specified in this section except upon a resolution of the appropriate commissioners setting forth the reasons and particularly specifying the place of the construction. When a bridge, pipe or culvert shall have been constructed as required, and accepted and approved by the director of highways, it shall become county property and be maintained as other county bridges.
