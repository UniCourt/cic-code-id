Any person responsible through his conduct, acts and/or control of property or operations for either the starting or the existence of such fire is hereby required to make a reasonable effort to control or extinguish it immediately, without awaiting instructions from the director of the department of lands or a fire warden. The director of the department of lands or any fire warden may summarily abate the nuisance thus constituted by controlling or extinguishing such fire and the person willfully or negligently responsible for the starting or existence of such fire shall be liable for the costs incurred by the state or its authorized agencies in controlling or extinguishing the same. The amount of such costs shall be recovered by a civil action prosecuted in the name of the state of Idaho and any amounts recovered shall be paid to the state treasurer for deposit to the forest protection fund. Civil liability provided for herein shall be exclusive of and in addition to any criminal penalties otherwise provided.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a civil action against any person, legal entity, state or political subdivision for forest or range fire caused by a negligent or unintentional act, which act was not willful or intentional under section 6-202, Idaho Code, the real and personal property damage is limited to:

As further used in this subsection, “fair market value” means the amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arms-length transaction when both parties are fully informed about all of the advantages and disadvantages of the property and neither is acting under any compulsion to buy or sell, as determined by a state certified appraiser, who is qualified to appraise the property. Claims against the state or a political subdivision shall remain subject to the requirements of chapter 9, title 6, Idaho Code, and damages against the state or a political subdivision shall be the amount set forth in chapter 9, title 6, Idaho Code, as limited in this subsection.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2013, ch. 62 provided: “Legislative Intent. The Legislature finds that generally, real and personal property damage caused by forest and range fire is measured by the diminution of fair market value of the real and personal property. In Idaho, restoration damages may be awarded if there is a reason personal to the owner for restoring the forest or range land to its original condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The Legislature further finds that in other jurisdictions, large forest or range land owners have sought and have been awarded double recovery, the diminution of fair market value and restoration costs, for the damage to forest or range land caused by forest or range fires. The awards include intangible environmental damages that are clearly speculative in their nature, and should not be recoverable. This legislation clarifies that for real and personal property damage caused by forest or range fire, recovery is limited to reasonable suppression costs, economic damages and either the diminution of fair market value of the real and personal property, or the actual and tangible costs for restoration, not intangible environmental damages, as a result of the forest or range fire.”

        § 38-111. Protection by owner — Assessments — Budget of protective districts.
       </h3>
       <p>
        Every owner of forest lands in the state shall furnish or provide therefor, throughout the closed season, protection against the starting, existence or spread of fires thereon, or therefrom, in conformity with reasonable rules and standards for adequate protection, to be established by the state board of land commissioners. An owner of forest lands who maintains a membership in good standing in a forest protective association operating under agreement with the state board of land commissioners, which association maintains a standard of protection approved by said board and who pays the assessments to the association in the amounts required in this section, shall be deemed to have fully complied herewith. In the event the owner of any forest land shall neglect or fail to furnish the protection required in this section, the director of the department of lands shall provide such patrol and protection therefor at actual cost to the owner of forest lands. For private owners of forest lands whose total acres of forest lands are twenty-six (26) acres or more, the state board of land commissioners shall establish this cost not to exceed sixty-five cents (65¢) an acre per year. For private owners of forest lands whose total acres of forest lands are twenty-five (25) acres or fewer, the minimum assessment per year shall be equal to the per acre cost multiplied by twenty-five (25).
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to any other assessment prescribed in this chapter, the state board of land commissioners shall establish a surcharge to be levied and assessed in an amount not to exceed forty dollars ($40.00) for each improved lot or parcel to offset costs associated with wildfire preparedness.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is hereby established in the state treasury a wildfire equipment replacement fund for the replacement of capital wildfire equipment. The department of lands shall determine reimbursement rates for all capital fire equipment used for activities other than fire preparedness. Reimbursement revenues shall be deposited in the wildfire equipment replacement fund. Additional moneys may be deposited into the wildfire equipment replacement fund from any other source.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the event an assessment is made in an amount less than the maximum hereinbefore provided, and an actual loss occurs which exceeds the amount budgeted and for which assessments have been made, the director of the department of lands, with the approval of the board, may require an additional assessment to be made and paid, which together with the original assessment shall not exceed the maximum assessment set forth in this section. Such additional assessment shall be levied and collected in the same manner as herein provided for the collection of such original assessments. The liability provided in this section shall be calculated for each forest protection district or association separately, and shall be calculated solely upon the charges assignable to fire control or presuppression of fires within each district or association.
    Each forest protective association actively engaged in forest protection under agreement with the state board of land commissioners shall each year prepare in detail, a budget of all estimated operating costs for the next fiscal year and shall submit this budget to the board for approval before August 31 of the current year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except for the provisions of section 38-122, Idaho Code, and cases of proven negligence by the landowner or his agent, no other charges or assessments for fire protection shall be made or assessed or collected from those forest landowners participating as provided herein.

       </p>
       <p>
        On or before the first Monday in July of each year, the association secretary shall determine the names of all owners of forest lands within the boundaries of the particular forest protective association who have failed to provide the forest fire protection for their lands required by this act, together with the description of such lands and the acreage thereof and calculate the total amount due hereunder from each such owner for such forest fire protection which shall not exceed the maximum hereinbefore specified.

      § 38-115. Closed season for fires — Permits — Regulations — Extension of closed season — Suspension of permits — Penalty.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The period from May 10 to October 20, inclusive, of each year shall be known as the closed season. During the closed season it shall be unlawful for any person to set or cause to be set a fire in any slashing area, or a fire to any stump or stumps, log or logs, down or standing timber or to set or cause to be set, a fire on any forest or range lands or dangerously near thereto, or in any field in any forest protective district, without having first procured a permit from the fire warden of the district, provided, that unless campfires have been prohibited during critical hazard periods, campfires may be set without permit provided there is compliance with the provisions of section 38-116, Idaho Code. Every permit shall prescribe the conditions upon which the permit is given, and contain rules and regulations governing the setting of fires and the prevention of the spread thereof to the property of another. At no time shall any fire be set when the wind is blowing to such an extent as to cause danger of the fire getting beyond the control of the person responsible for setting it, or without sufficient men, tools, supplies and firefighting equipment to control it, and the fire shall be kept under the control of the person responsible for setting it until it is out. The state board of land commissioners shall from time to time make all necessary rules and regulations governing the setting of fires on forest lands for both the closed and open season, and for their proper control and extinguishment. It shall be the duty of the director of the department of lands to prepare the proper form of permit to be used in carrying out the provisions of this section. The fire wardens shall at all times have authority to refuse permits and/or to revoke the same and to postpone their use when issued, when they shall deem it necessary so to do in the interest of public safety. Any permits obtained by misrepresentation shall be invalid.
     </p>
     <p>
      In seasons, localities and under conditions of unusual fire danger, the director, with the advice of the fire warden of any protective district, shall have the power to extend the period of closed fire season in any district of the aforementioned districts to meet the particular fire hazard of each district, and when the safety of the public requires, change the closed season in any district by fixing inclusive dates other than those herein designated; close to entry therein by any person or party, the forest and range lands in any section of the state wherein a critical fire hazard exists, and may restrict or suspend travel on any road or trail leading into any such land, until a permit shall have secured from the fire warden of the forest protective district wherein such lands are situated, and may also, without proclamation, suspend any and all permits or privileges authorized by this section and prohibit the setting of any campfires, and/or fire in forest and range land or dangerously near to such, or in fields in any forest protective district.

        Former laws regulating railroad rights of way near forest land could not have been considered as imposing on defendant a standard of care impossible of fulfillment, but if there was nothing to show that grass or other inflammable materials could not have been removed either by burning them off the railroad right of way during the closed season under permit provided for in former law, or by plowing over the right of way, the evidence would have sufficed to justify a finding of the violation, thereby rendering the railroad company liable.

       Everyone engaged, or about to engage, in the cutting of any forest product or potential forest product upon lands within the state of Idaho shall provide for the management and reduction of the fire hazard thus created or to be created by first securing a certificate of compliance from the director of the department of lands or his agent, said compliance to provide the option of entering into a fire hazard reduction agreement as provided in sections 38-401 through 38-410, Idaho Code, inclusive, or by posting a cash bond to the state of Idaho in such form and for such amount as may be prescribed by the director of the department of lands: provided, however, that the amount of the bond so prescribed shall not be in excess of the amount which such person would be required to pay under said sections 38-401 through 38-410, Idaho Code, inclusive, and that the bond shall be conditioned upon full and faithful compliance with all requirements under said sections 38-401 through 38-410, Idaho Code, inclusive, and the faithful reduction of such fire hazards in the manner prescribed by law. Provided further that the initial purchaser of ties, logs, posts, cordwood, pulpwood and other similar forest products which have been cut from lands within the state of Idaho shall make no such purchase from anyone not having a proper compliance under this section and formal acceptance of notification under subsection (2) of section 38-1306, Idaho Code. When a person elects to have hazard reduction money withheld in lieu of posting a cash bond, the purchaser of forest products shall withhold the money and said money so withheld in any one (1) calendar month shall be paid to the director of the department of lands or his agent on or before the last day of the next calendar month. After sending such moneys to the director of the department of lands the purchaser shall not be further liable to the state of Idaho or to the person from whom the money was withheld. The director of the department of lands, upon receipt of the cash bond or transmittal of withheld money, shall promptly deposit the same with the state treasurer to be held in trust until the hazard has been reduced as required by law. Such hazard reduction shall be accomplished by the responsible party within the terms set forth in the certificate of compliance or such additional time as may be granted by the director of the department of lands, and upon completion thereof, the director of the department of lands or his agent shall issue a certificate of clearance, stating that all the terms of this section have been complied with. Such clearance shall constitute reason for the release of said hazard reduction money and payment to the person entitled thereto or release of the cash bond posted, except that: (a) three percent (3%) of the hazard reduction money or bond shall be deposited in a special account to be known as the fire suppression account, which is hereby created in the dedicated fund of the state treasury, and which shall be used by the department of lands to help pay the cost of suppressing forest fires; and (b) as determined by the state board of land commissioners, for harvest from private land, an additional amount, not to exceed three percent (3%) of the hazard reduction money or bond shall be deposited in the forest practices administration account established in section 38-135, Idaho Code, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the forest practices act, section 38-1301 et seq., Idaho Code. In the event the hazard reduction shall not be accomplished within said period of time, the money shall be released by the state treasurer on direction from the director of the department of lands less the three percent (3%) deduction specified for the fire suppression account and for harvest from private land, the deduction specified by the state board of land commissioners for the forest practices administration account, and credited to the “forest management account” for the management and reduction of any fire hazard and for the protection of forest resources as provided by section 38-408, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In the event one responsible therefor shall fail, refuse or neglect to properly dispose of slash in accordance with the requirements of section 38-122, Idaho Code, and such person responsible therefor is engaged or is about to engage, either for himself or for another, in cutting timber or other forest products, and thereby creating a fire hazard anywhere within the state, he may be enjoined from cutting such timber or other forest products and thereby creating a fire hazard until he shall have complied with the provisions of section 38-122, Idaho Code. Such injunction proceedings may be instituted by the director of the department of lands as plaintiff and the court may in its discretion grant a temporary injunction. In any such proceedings no bond shall be required of the plaintiff and such a proceeding shall be handled in any court by the judge thereof with expedition.
     </p>
     <p>
      If one responsible therefor has for any reason failed to comply with section 38-122, Idaho Code, and has without such compliance cut timber or other forest products, and shall fail, refuse or neglect to properly dispose of slash for a period of thirty (30) days after being notified so to do by the director of the department of lands or the fire warden of the forest protective district within which such slash has accumulated, the director of the department of lands, or the fire warden, may, if he deems it advisable, complete, direct or authorize the disposal of such slash at the expense of the owner of the timber or other forest products cut or produced from the land upon which such fire hazard remains undisposed of as aforesaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cost and expense of such disposal, plus twenty per cent (20%) of the cost and expense of such disposal as a penalty, shall constitute a prior lien upon the timber and/or other forest products so cut or produced from such land. If payment of such cost and penalty be not made within ten (10) days after demand in writing, the director of the department of lands shall file for record with the county recorder of the county in which such timber or other forest products were cut, or, if the same have been removed to another county, then in such county, a notice of lien upon any and all forest products cut from the area of slash undisposed of as aforesaid, and such lien shall also attach to all identifiable processed products thereof, and the perfection of such lien rights shall as nearly as practicable be in conformity with the provisions of section 45-407, Idaho Code, so far as the same is applicable, and duly verified as therein provided. Any claims of lien recorded as herein provided shall be released in writing by the director of the department of lands upon payment of the cost and penalty herein provided. After the filing of notice of lien, any purchaser or purchasers of any of such forest products who have disposed of the same or who shall have so mingled such forest products or the processed products thereof with other property as to prevent identification of such forest products, and thereby prevent the sale of any such products in such foreclosure proceedings, shall be liable for the full amount of the judgment recovered, provided such purchaser is made a party defendant in the suit for the foreclosure of lien. The proceedings for the enforcement of said lien shall conform as nearly as may be to the proceedings provided by law for the enforcement of loggers’ lien, or the amount of such cost and penalty may be recovered by a civil action for debt, prosecuted in the name of the state of Idaho, and payable to the state treasurer for deposit in the forest protection fund.
    The director of the department of lands shall not file for record any lien against the property of any person who has been issued a certificate of clearance in accordance with section 38-122, Idaho Code, covering such property.
     </p>
     <p>
      All orders and directions issued by the director of the department of lands, or any fire warden, as required or authorized by this section and section 38-122, Idaho Code, shall be in writing and made in triplicate, the original of which shall be sent by registered mail or delivered by personal service to the person to receive such order, permits or directions; one (1) copy shall be filed in the office of the director of the department of lands; and one (1) copy shall be filed in the district warden’s file.

        Substantial evidence supported referee’s finding that the state’s lien against lumber company for the cost of slash disposal on the logged-off premises was not invalid, although another company might be responsible for the cost of the burning of the slash.

        Where state claimed a lien against non-warehoused logs and lumber, but not against remainder of the lumber on the debtor’s premises, such was not a waiver of the right to collect the entire sum due. Diamond Nat’l Corp. v. Lee, 333 F.2d 517 (9th Cir. 1964).

      § 38-401. Supervision by director of the department of lands.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The director of the department of lands shall have the supervision, control and management of all fire hazards created by insects, disease, other natural causes, or by any person engaged in harvesting timber, ties, logs, poles, posts, cordwood, pulpwood, or any other forest product or potential forest product upon lands within the state of Idaho for the protection of forest resources, and shall have supervision, control and management of all fire hazard reduction plans, programs and regulations of or under the forestry laws of the state of Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      The supervision, control, management or reduction, or any combination thereof, of fire hazards referred to in this section and in this chapter may include or be limited to the taking of protective measures reasonably intended to prevent the injury to or the destruction of forest resources without the actual abatement of the hazard. It shall be the public policy of this state, without unnecessarily restricting the director of the department of lands, to reduce, wherever practical, fire hazards by disposal or treatment of the slash created by the harvesting of forest products, having due regard for the effective and economical overall protection of forest land and resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      In those cases where complete disposal or treatment of the slash is not planned or where partial disposal or treatment is planned the state forest warden shall submit to the director a detailed plan of protection for each separate operation listing the proposed expenditures and the amounts collected or to be collected. The director may approve such plan if the proposed expenditures are limited to one or more of the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t38c04s38-401ol11">
       Acquisition of equipment needed for fire protection or reduction of fire hazards referred to in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c04s38-401ol12">
       Construction of appropriate structures aiding in fire protection or hazard reduction.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c04s38-401ol13">
       Acquisition or contracting for communications or a communication system.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c04s38-401ol14">
       Acquisition of appropriate tools, machinery and equipment needed for fire protection or hazard reduction.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c04s38-401ol15">
       Payment of personnel and apportioned overhead employed by the forest protective district.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c04s38-401ol16">
       Road maintenance and construction in slash areas where a fire hazard exists.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The percentage of total moneys accredited to each forest protective district that may be used within the district for protective measures in lieu of actual abatement of the fire hazards shall be determined annually by the director.

     <p>
      In more heavily timbered areas of the state, on lands owned by the federal government, state of Idaho, the counties, individuals, and on land in transit to counties through tax delinquency, devastating forest fires annually denude considerable areas of vegetation and subject such lands to erosion with total loss of top soils; permit an infestation of weeds which imperil adjacent agricultural lands, destroy feed and cover for wild life, and create great distress in agriculture through loss of grazing. Therefore, the seeding of such burned areas to suitable range grasses and/or legumes as soon as possible after the cessation of such fires is declared to be a matter of public welfare to the state.

     <p>
      The boards of county commissioners of the various counties are hereby authorized to create areas that may hereafter be burned over within their respective counties, into “Burn Seeding Areas”, and such boards may purchase, or authorize the purchase of seed to seed a part or all of such areas. The county boards are also authorized to enter into contracts with other state agencies or with federal agencies to seed land under the jurisdiction of such agencies within such “Burn Seeding Areas.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the Board of County Commissioners of any county deems it necessary or desirable to create a “Burn Seeding Area,” it must by resolution adopted by a majority of the members of said Board, setting forth in such resolution that such said Burning [Burn] Seeding Area is necessary within the county, and describing all of the lands included in said area, and fixing a time of hearing. The Clerk of the Board must publish said resolution and a notice requiring all interested persons to appear at a time and place before said Board, as designated in said resolution, and show cause if any they have why said Burn Seeding Area should not be created. Said notice must be published in one issue of a weekly newspaper published in the County. If no newspaper is published in the county, then in such paper as the Board may direct in its resolution. Said resolution and said notice shall provide a date of hearing, which shall be not less than ten days from the date of publication. Upon said hearing, after fully considering said matter, if the Board finds that the creation of said Burn Seeding Area is desirable and necessary, it shall make an order in writing to that effect, and file the same with the Clerk of the District Court in and for said County. Anyone interested may appeal to the District Court under the procedure set forth by Sections 31-1510, 31-1511, 31-1512[, Idaho Code].

        The first sentence in the second paragraph is somewhat confusing.

    Any failure to renew a log brand as required by law shall be deemed an abandonment of same. Abandoned or canceled log brands shall not be reissued for a period of one (1) year unless the Idaho board of scaling practices so authorizes for cause.

     </h3>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t38c12s38-1209ol1a">
       The board is hereby authorized and directed to levy an assessment on the scale of all forest products harvested within the state of Idaho in an amount not to exceed twenty cents (20¢) per thousand (1,000) board feet or twelve cents (12¢) per cunit, and no such assessment shall be levied more than once on any forest product except as herein expressly provided. The board shall set times and places for its meetings and shall hold not less than two (2) meetings in each calendar year. The board shall designate a meeting date on which a budget shall be adopted and assessment shall be levied. Notice of such meeting shall be given thirty (30) days prior thereto in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the state. The board shall designate and levy an assessment as herein provided to raise moneys necessary to fund operations of the board and the state scaling program established by this chapter based upon the budget adopted and notice of such levy shall be given in the notice of the budget. The budget and assessment shall become effective upon adoption by the board. In the event a written request is made therefor by any interested person within thirty (30) days after notice of the budget and assessment has been published, the board shall set a time and place for a hearing at which any person may submit recommendations for changes in the budget and the assessment. Thereafter the board shall either confirm or modify the budget and assessment and cause notice of such action to be published in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the state within ten (10) days after such action. If the budget or the assessment is modified, the modification shall become effective upon publication. Such hearing shall be held not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request therefor.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c12s38-1209ol1b">
       The assessment herein provided shall be levied against, and paid by both, the timber owner and the timber purchaser, provided that no assessment shall be levied against the timber owner on forest products harvested from lands owned by the United States of America or the state of Idaho. Said assessment shall be levied twice in an equal amount, once against the timber owner and once against the timber purchaser. The term “purchaser” as used herein shall also include the owner of the timber where the owner processes or utilizes the forest products in its operations or where the owner sells forest products outside the state of Idaho and the forest products are scaled within the state of Idaho, provided that the assessment provided in this chapter shall not be levied against the United States of America, nor the state of Idaho, nor any unit nor agency thereof. The timber purchaser shall withhold any assessment money owed by the timber owner and said money so withheld shall be paid to the board. All assessment money shall be transmitted by the timber purchaser to the board on or before the twentieth day of each month for all timber harvested during the previous month.
    (c) The secretary of the board shall receive and account for all moneys derived under the provisions of this act, and shall pay the same monthly to the state treasurer, who shall keep such moneys in a separate account to be known as the “state scaling account,” which is hereby created in the state treasury. Such account shall be kept separate and apart from all other moneys in the treasury, and shall be paid out only on approval of the board. All moneys in the “state scaling account” are hereby continually appropriated for the use of the board. The board may establish, maintain and use a rotary fund as provided by state law. The secretary of the board shall give a surety bond to the state in such sum as the board may determine. The premium on said bond shall be regarded as a proper and necessary expense of the board, and shall be paid out of the “state scaling account.” The secretary of the board shall receive such salary as the board shall determine in addition to the compensation and expenses provided in section 38-1205, Idaho Code. The board may employ such clerical or other assistants as are necessary for the proper performance of its work, and may make expenditures of this account for any purpose which in the opinion of the board is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of its duties under this act. All warrants on said “state scaling account” shall be drawn by the state controller on vouchers by the board and the state board of examiners.

All checkscaling costs shall be determined by using the costs of checkscaling at the time of request as determined by the board. The checkscaler shall make a report of his findings to the board within a reasonable time after each checkscale and said report shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts stated in such report.

      The board shall establish and prescribe the criteria and basis for issuing apprenticeship certificates and for issuing temporary permits; provided, however, that an apprentice shall be authorized to scale only under the direct supervision of a licensed scaler and temporary permits may be issued only where there are no available scalers in the area and the surrounding circumstances warrant the issuance of a temporary permit. Temporary permits may be issued for such time periods and at such fee as may be determined by the board, provided, however, that a temporary permit shall not be issued for a period of time in excess of three (3) months. Apprenticeship certificates shall require the apprentice to scale as an apprentice for a period of ninety (90) working days and at the expiration of said ninety (90) day period to take the licensed scalers examination as in this act provided.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that forest practices conducted on forest land in urbanizing areas are often subjected to nuisance lawsuits, and that such suits encourage and even force the premature removal of the lands from forest uses and in some cases prohibit investments in forest improvements. It is the intent of the legislature to reduce the loss to the state of its forest resources by limiting the circumstances under which forest practices may be deemed to be a nuisance. The legislature also finds that the right to conduct forest practices is a natural right and is recognized as a permitted use in the state of Idaho.

      It is in the interest of all the people of Idaho that the abundant forest resources of the state be protected, and properly managed to produce multiple resources and values along with sustained yields of timber to support the economic welfare of the state. Because forest management, on both public and private lands, is important to each citizen of the state, it is the purpose by the enactment of this chapter to promote the economic and environmental welfare of the state by providing a means for the collection and dissemination of information regarding the management of the state’s public and private forest lands and the forest products industry.
