        There is a distinction between a license and the privileges granted by that license. The disqualification of privileges does not impact one’s status as a holder of a license. A commercial driver’s license is distinct from the driving privileges granted under it, and a driver may still “hold” that license, despite being disqualified from exercising certain privileges.

A commercial driver’s license is distinct from the driving privileges granted under it, and a driver may still “hold” that license, despite being disqualified from exercising certain privileges.

        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 325, deleted the last sentence in subsection (4), which read “The authority of the board to establish speed limits on state highways pursuant to this section does not restrict the authority of the duly elected officials of an incorporated city acting in the capacity of a local authority to establish lower speed limits for portions of state highways, excluding controlled access and interstate highways, that pass through residential, urban or business districts within the jurisdiction of the incorporated city, for the purpose of enhancing motorist and pedestrian safety.”

        The 2014 amendment, by ch. 126, in the first sentence of subsection (4), inserted “provided that this speed may be increased to eighty (80) miles per hour if the department completes an engineering and traffic study on the interstate highway and concludes that the increase is in the public interest and the transportation board concurs with such conclusion” following “interstate highways” and inserted “ provided that this speed may be increased to seventy (70) miles per hour if the department completes an engineering and traffic study on the state highway and concludes that the increase is in the public interest and the transportation board concurs with such conclusion” following “state highways.”

        Defendant alleged he was prejudiced by the admission of the exhibit showing that the state board of highway directors (now transportation board) fixed and designated 35 miles per hour as the reasonable, safe, prima facie speed limit upon a certain portion of U.S. Highway 30. He could not make a showing of prejudice because he did not subpoena a witness to establish his contention, and because the section of the highway where the collision occurred was in an “urban district” where 35 miles per hour was the prima facie speed limit. State v. Wendler, 83 Idaho 213, 360 P.2d 697 (1961). Failure to Comply.

       <p>
        Since former law provided for a uniform system of traffic controls to be incorporated in a manual, which was done and which was specifically adopted by the Idaho state department of highways, and former law provided that local authorities must comply with state requirements, such manual had the force of law and failure to comply with it was negligence per se.

        The court would take judicial notice of the order of board of highway directors (now transportation board) fixing and designating 35 miles per hour as the reasonable, safe, prima facie speed limit on certain portion of U.S. highway 30, and of the fact that the section of the highway to which it relates was a part of the “state highway system.” State v.

        The law presumes that the board of highway directors (now transportation board) discharged its duty lawfully and in the manner prescribed by statute in fixing and designating 35 miles per hour as the reasonable, safe, prima facie speed limit upon that portion of U.S. Highway 30, where the collision occurred.

      Pursuant to federal law, the Idaho transportation department is hereby authorized to enter into reciprocal agreements with the regulatory agencies of other states having jurisdiction and authority over motor carriers to provide for base state agreements in which the registration of interstate carriers operating in participating states may be accomplished by registration in one (1) base state. Carriers electing to register under base state agreements shall be subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the Idaho transportation department to the same extent as they would if they did not participate in the base state agreement. The fees authorized by federal law, or such lesser fees as the participating states agree to, may be collected, and the base state may require further filings of certificates of insurance, surety bonds, et cetera, to show the carrier’s qualifications to operate. Participating carriers shall register their authority directly with the transportation department and not with other state or local agencies.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 1999 amendment, by ch. 81, in subdivision (2)(g), substituted “furnishing copies of” for “answering inquiries as to,” in subdivision (2)(h), substituted “searching files” for “furnishing copies of files,” in subsection (20), in the last sentence, inserted a hyphen between “traffic” and “control” in two places, in subsection (23), substituted “controlled-access” for “controlled access,” and in subsection (25), inserted “(1)” following “crosses one.”

        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 331, increased the fees throughout subsection (2); and substituted “state highway account” for “state highway fund” four times in subsection (5).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 325, deleted “except where the duly elected officials of an incorporated city have established speed limits lower than those set by the department on the portion of state highways, excluding controlled-access and interstate highways, that pass through residential, urban or business districts within the jurisdiction of the incorporated city” from the end of the second sentence in subsection (20) and similar language from the end of subsection (22).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 274, deleted subsection (25), which read: “Wherever a highway crosses one (1) or more railroads at grade, the department or local authorities within their respective jurisdictions shall place and maintain stop signs, directing vehicular traffic approaching the crossing to come to a full stop prior to entering the crossing at all railroad crossings where electric or mechanical warning signals do not exist. Placement of these stop signs shall be mandatory except when in the determination of public highway agencies the existence of stop signs at a given crossing would constitute a greater hazard than their absence based on a recognized engineering study.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as granting immunity to any railroad company as to liability, if any, for an accident which might occur at a crossing where stop signs are erected and in place, but liability, if any, shall be determined as provided by law. Liability on the part of governmental authorities on account of absence of any stop sign at a crossing shall be determined as provided by law”, and redesignated the subsequent subsections accordingly.

However, he was in violation of a local municipal ordinance, which was not in conflict with the state code, and this gave a police officer probable cause to make a traffic stop. State v.

        DUI defendant, who crossed over a stop line to see around a fence which was obstructing his view of oncoming traffic, was not in violation of Idaho stop sign statute because the statute allowed motorists various options for compliance in coming to a stop at an intersection. However, he was in violation of a local municipal ordinance, which was not in conflict with the state code, and this gave a police officer probable cause to make a traffic stop. State v.

         One (1) parking space shall be designated for every thirty-five (35) spaces of on-street parking available on each downtown street block. These parking spaces shall be parallel with the sidewalk where parallel parking is required, or at an angle to the sidewalk where angle parking is required. Should angle parking be used, the parking spaces so designated for use by a person with a disability shall conform to the federal Americans with disabilities act. All accessible parking spaces shall be located on the shortest route to curb cuts and ramps for use by wheelchairs and other mobility aids and devices. For the purposes of this section, the term “downtown” means the business center of a city as designated by the city council of the city.

The above sight obstructions shall not extend more than three (3) feet, or less than ten (10) feet, in height above the existing center line highway elevation within the vision triangle of vehicle operators. The boundaries of the vision triangle are defined by measuring from the intersection of the edges of two (2) adjacent highways forty (40) feet along each highway and connecting the two (2) points with a straight line.

      Any person who shall operate a vehicle, not his own, without the consent of the owner, and with intent temporarily to deprive the owner of his possession of such vehicle, without intent to steal the vehicle, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, unless the damages caused to the vehicle as a result of a violation of this section exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) in value, or the value of property taken from the vehicle exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000), or a combination of the damages caused to the vehicle and the value of property taken exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000), in which case such person is guilty of a felony. The consent of the owner of a vehicle to its taking or operating shall not in any case be presumed or implied because of such owner’s consent on a previous occasion to the taking or operating of the vehicle by the same or a different person. Any person who assists in, or is a party or accessory to or an accomplice in any unauthorized taking or operation shall also be guilty of a misdemeanor, unless the damages caused to the vehicle as a result of a violation of this section exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) in value, or the value of property taken from the vehicle exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000), or a combination of the damages caused to the vehicle and the value of property taken exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000), in which case such person is guilty of a felony. For the purpose of this section vehicle shall include, but is not limited to vehicles defined in section 49-123, Idaho Code, boats, airplanes, snowmobiles, three and four wheel all-terrain vehicles, hot air balloons, hang gliders, jet skis and motorcycles.

        This section, construed as a whole, defines a misdemeanor and is not applicable in a civil action for damages suffered in an automobile collision. Abbs v. Redmond, 64 Idaho 369, 132 P.2d 1044 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Operation of a vehicle within the meaning of this section means that a person has to be using it as a means of transportation; the state failed to demonstrate that the defendant was riding the bicycle at the time she took it, where defendant pushed rather than rode the bicycle, and pushing the bicycle is not the same as operating the bicycle.

        Not every charge of grand theft will necessarily include the offense of joy riding, but where the essential elements of joy riding are the “manner or means” by which the grand theft was alleged to have been committed and the evidence is sufficient to show that the defendant committed the offense of joy riding during the alleged commission of the offense of grand theft (auto), joy riding was a lesser included offense of grand theft (auto). State v. Tomes, 118 Idaho 952, 801 P.2d 1303 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a pickup truck was taken at night and, although defendant mailed the owner $2.00 allegedly as consideration for the truck, no attempt was made to contact the owner about working out arrangements to pay for it even though defendant had been in possession of the vehicle for 12 days and had driven through several states before he was apprehended, where defendant had placed a stolen license plate on the vehicle and, when apprehended, told the police that his proof of purchase was in the mail and where defendant did not state that he had only intended to “temporarily” deprive the owner of possession but maintained simply that he had intended to pay for the vehicle or for the use of it, the trial court, in a prosecution for grand larceny, did not err in refusing to give a requested instruction on joy-riding.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2018, ch. 324 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature, as immobilization of motor vehicles by booting in the state of Idaho vitally affects the public interest and the public welfare, and that in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate those who operate motor vehicle booting businesses in Idaho by local government, in order to prevent frauds, impositions, and other abuses upon its citizens. The Legislature finds it necessary to allow local governments to establish minimum consumer protection standards as well as remedies for motorists who suffer property damage as a result of having their motor vehicles booted or who claim to have been wrongfully booted.”

      Upon the conviction or reversal of conviction of any person for the violation of any of the provisions of this title, the judicial officer before whom the proceedings are had or the clerk of the district court shall immediately transmit the facts of the case to the department, either in paper or electronic form, including the name, address, date of birth, and the driver’s license number or social security number of the party charged, and any judgment issued, including a withheld judgment. The judicial officer or the clerk of the district court shall also forward to the department information regarding the character of the punishment, and the amount of any fine imposed and paid, the ordered sentence and its terms, and the ordered suspension period, including when the suspension is to commence. The information provided to the department shall be certified if submitted in paper form; no certification is required for electronic transfers of information. The department shall enter the facts either in the records of registered vehicles, or in the records of registered dealers, or in the driver’s license records, as the case may be, opposite the name of the person so convicted, and in the case of any other person, in a record of offenders, to be kept for that purpose. If an individual is reincarcerated while that person’s driver’s license or driving privileges are suspended, the department of correction is to notify the department that the individual is reincarcerated, as well as the terms and period of reincarceration. If the conviction be reversed on appeal, the person whose conviction has been reversed may serve on the department a certified copy of the order of reversal, and the department shall enter the reversal in the proper records.

    Where driver’s license has been suspended and he has been granted a restricted permit to operate a motor vehicle for certain purposes only, and he violates the restrictions, his violation would be operating the vehicle without privilege under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c80s18-8001" target="_blank">§ 18-8001</a></cite>, not for lack of a valid license; however, when the suspension period ends, if his privileges were not restored at the conclusion of the suspension period or the driver does not take the necessary steps to have his privileges restored, then he could be cited for violation of this section, for at this point his privileges would not be suspended but he would not have a valid license to drive.

        This section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c04s49-456" target="_self">§ 49-456</a></cite>(1), under which defendant was prosecuted, did not unconstitutionally impair his rights to religious freedom. State v. Crisman, 123 Idaho 277, 846 P.2d 928 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>

        Where defendant was stopped and had no driver’s license, or proof of insurance, the registration defendant produced was for a different vehicle, and the vehicle’s license plates were fictitious, the officer had grounds to arrest the defendant, and the search of defendant’s vehicle incident to that arrest, which revealed methamphetamine, was upheld.

        In defendant’s criminal prosecution for driving without a valid driver’s license, the trial court was not required to instruct the jury as to criminal intent; knowledge of a suspension of the defendant’s license was not an element of the offense.

       <p>
        Driving with an invalid license is a lesser-included offense of driving without privileges under both the statutory and the pleading theories; therefore, where defendant’s license was suspended for failing to take care of a citation, a conviction for driving with an invalid license was appropriate where the original charge was driving without privileges.

        Where defendant was stopped by the police while driving during a period in which his license was suspended, because he had accumulated an excessive number of violation points, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for driving without a valid license.

        This section was amended by two 1996 acts — ch. 348, § 1, and ch. 371, § 6, both effective July 1, 1996 — which appear to conflict as both acts added a subdivision (12). The subdivision (12) as added by ch. 371, § 6, has been designated as “[13](12)” by the compiler.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 348, § 1, added subdivision (12).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1996 amendment, by ch. 371, § 6, in subdivision (9), substituted “furnish” for “deposit” and “furnished” for “deposited”; and added subdivision (12), which has been compiled here as subdivision [13](12).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 110, in subsections (6) and (7), added “and such order has been received by the department”; in subsection (6), added “Has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be”; and in subsection (7), deleted “previously” preceding “been adjudged,” inserted “by a licensed physician or by a court of competent jurisdiction,” and substituted “mental incompetence that would affect the person’s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle” for “mental disability or disease.”
    This section was amended by two 2008 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 63, added subsection (14).

        Although Idaho provided that the right to travel and the right to operate a motor vehicle on public highways were constitutional rights, the requirement pursuant to subsection (2) of this section that a driver’s license applicant disclose his social security number was deemed a reasonable regulation with the state’s police power and, accordingly, did not constitute an unconstitutional impingement of defendant’s rights.

       The application of any person under the age of eighteen (18) years for any class D instruction permit, restricted driver’s license, restricted school attendance driving permit, driver training instruction permit or driver’s license shall be signed and verified before a person authorized to administer oaths by either the father or mother of the applicant, if both are living and have custody of him; or if either be dead, then by the surviving parent who has custody of him; or by the Idaho resident host of a foreign exchange student, or in the event neither parent is living, or if living and does not have the custody of the applicant, then by the person or guardian having such custody, with verifiable custody or guardianship documents, or by an employer of the applicant. In the event there is no guardian or employer, then some other responsible person willing to assume the obligation for the applicant may sign the application. Any person who signs the applicant’s application shall attest that the applicant is in compliance with the school attendance provisions of section 49-303A, Idaho Code. When the minor person applies for a class D driver’s license, a parent or guardian or a person authorized by the parent or guardian shall attest that the minor person has satisfied the requirements and conditions applicable to the class D supervised instruction permit pursuant to section 49-307, Idaho Code. The person willing to assume responsibility for the applicant must be at least eighteen (18) years of age. When signing for a restricted school attendance driving permit, the person signing the applicant’s application shall attest that the conditions set forth within section 49-307A, Idaho Code, are met. Each application for a restricted school attendance driving permit shall also be signed by the local county sheriff, the president of the board of trustees of the local school district, and the school principal of the applicant’s school, verifying that the conditions set forth within section 49-307A, Idaho Code, are met.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 2002 amendment, by ch. 357, § 1, in subsection (3), substituted “maintains” for “deposits”, substituted “or there is maintained upon his behalf, proof of financial responsibility as required” for “or there is deposited upon his behalf, proof of financial responsibility in respect to the operation of any motor vehicle, in form and in amounts as required” and substituted “subject to liability for the negligence and willful misconduct of the person under the age of eighteen (18) years, as imposed under” for “subject to the liability imposed under.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2014 amendment, by ch. 92, in subsection (1), inserted “driver training instruction permit” near the beginning of the first sentence, deleted “and when signing for a class D driver’s training permit or a class D supervised instruction permit, and temporary permits” following “Idaho Code” at the end of the third sentence, added “When the minor person applies for a class D driver’s license, a parent or guardian or a person authorized by the parent or guardian” at the beginning and deleted “when the minor person applies for a class D driver’s license” at the end of the fourth sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 84, substituted “pedestrian, bicycle or electric-assisted bicycle infraction” for “pedestrian or bicycle infraction” in the last sentence of subsection (4).

However, a skills test may be required for any and all other applicants at the discretion of the examiner or department for a class A, B, C or D driver’s license or a motorcycle endorsement. In addition, the applicant’s knowledge of traffic laws of this state and when a motorcycle endorsement is applied for, the applicant’s knowledge of safe motorcycle operating practices and traffic laws specifically relating to motorcycle operation shall be tested by a written examination, except as provided in section 49-319, Idaho Code.

        Running Status Check on License.
       </h5>
       <p>
        While this section does not specifically authorize the officer to run a status check on the driver’s license, the court of appeals correctly pointed out that “the statutory authority for police to demand a driver’s license would mean little if the police could not check the validity of the license”; running a license check validly fulfills two functions: it allows the officer to correctly identify the person with whom he is dealing and to determine if the license is valid. State v. Godwin, 121 Idaho 491, 826 P.2d 452 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to suppress was properly denied where evidence was found during a search incident to arrest because an officer’s act of running a driver’s license query was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment; the officer was responding to a complaint about a suspicious parked vehicle and defendant willingly responded to the officer’s questions. State v. Landreth, 139 Idaho 986, 88 P.3d 1226 (Ct. App. 2004).

       <p>
        The district court properly held that a police officer who lacks probable cause to make a traffic stop, but who otherwise had valid reasons for approaching a stopped vehicle, may request a driver’s license and conduct a driver’s license record check without violating the driver’s Fourth Amendment rights. State v. Godwin, 121 Idaho 478, 826 P.2d 517 (Ct. App. 1991).
    No seizure had occurred at the time the police pulled in behind defendant’s vehicle, which already was stopped on a public street, nor did the officers intrude upon any constitutionally-protected right by walking up to the defendant’s vehicle; the situation was quite different, however, once the deputy asked to see defendant’s driver’s license; by virtue of this section defendant was required to respond to the officer’s request; accordingly, defendant was “seized” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when the deputy took his license and the seizure was not justified as a valid licensing check, nor did it comport with the requirements of an investigatory detention, nor was it upheld as a lawful exercise of the officer’s community caretaking role. State v. Osborne, 121 Idaho 520, 826 P.2d 481 (Ct. App. 1991).

        This section requires a driver to surrender a driver’s license to a police officer upon demand; this section “implicitly recognizes” the public interest in allowing a police officer to ask for and check a driver’s license by giving a law enforcement officer the authority to require a driver of a motor vehicle to display his or her license on demand.

       <p>
        Idaho’s legislative scheme provides for two kinds of driver’s license suspensions. A court can, and sometimes must, judicially suspend a person’s driver’s license when the person pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a driving offense such as DUI. Alternatively,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c03s49-326" target="_self">§ 49-326</a></cite>(1) authorizes the Idaho department of transportation, under certain circumstances, to administratively suspend a person’s driver’s license where no court has done so. When an Idaho driver is convicted of a DUI outside Idaho, there is no direct basis for a judicial suspension and, instead, the administrative suspension scheme applies. Warner v. Idaho Transp. Dep’t, 160 Idaho 732, 378 P.3d 1031 (2016).

       Notification of suspension, revocation, cancellation or disqualification. Upon suspending, revoking, canceling or disqualifying the driver’s license or driving privileges of any person, the department shall immediately notify the applicant or licensee in writing, at the licensee’s address on file with the department pursuant to section 49-320, Idaho Code. Upon his request, the department shall afford him an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer appointed by the director. The hearing may be held by telephone within twenty (20) days after receipt of the request, unless this period is for good cause shown, extended by the hearing officer for one ten (10) day period. The notice and hearing shall be required prior to the imposition of additional suspension or disqualification periods beyond the periods as set forth in this section. Upon a hearing, the hearing officer may administer oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee. Upon the hearing, the department shall either rescind its order or, with good cause, may affirm or extend the suspension or disqualification of the driver’s license or revoke the driver’s license.
    Whenever a driver’s license, permit or driving privilege has been suspended or revoked by the department as provided in this section, other than as set forth in subsection (1)(c), (d), (g), (h), (m), (n) or (o) of this section, the department may issue a temporary restricted permit restricting the time, area and purpose of use.

        This section was amended by two 1996 acts — ch. 348, § 3, and ch. 371, § 13, both effective July 1, 1996 — which do not appear to conflict and have been compiled together.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 110, § 26, in subdivision (1)(a), inserted “suspension,” and added “court order or administrative action” at the end of the subdivision, in subdivision (1)(e), inserted “as evidenced by a conviction, court order or administrative action,” in the first sentence of subsection (5), deleted “and upon revoking a driver’s license or privileges shall not in any event grant application for a new driver’s license until the expiration of one (1) year after the revocation” following “a period of more than one (1) year,” and added “except as otherwise provided by law” at the end of the sentence.

        Idaho’s legislative scheme provides for two kinds of driver’s license suspensions. A court can, and sometimes must, judicially suspend a person’s driver’s license when the person pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a driving offense such as DUI. Alternatively, subsection (1) authorizes the Idaho department of transportation, under certain circumstances, to administratively suspend a person’s driver’s license where no court has done so. When an Idaho driver is convicted of a DUI outside Idaho, there is no direct basis for a judicial suspension and, instead, the administrative suspension scheme applies. Warner v. Idaho Transp. Dep’t, 160 Idaho 732, 378 P.3d 1031 (2016).

      § 49-326A. Administration by department of judicial suspensions of driver’s licenses or privileges to become effective after release from confinement.
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a court’s judgment or order provides that the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license or driving privileges shall begin after the individual is released from confinement or imprisonment, the department, for purposes of administering the ordered suspension, shall consider the driver’s license or driving privileges as suspended effective as of the end of the last day of the fixed portion of the ordered sentence, as shown by the judgment or sentencing order of the court.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t49c03s49-326Aol11">
       Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the suspension shall remain in effect until the individual applies for reinstatement of his or her driver’s license or driving privileges and can provide verifiable documentation to establish the date of release from confinement or imprisonment and show that the court-ordered suspension period has expired since the individual’s release. Upon such a showing, the department will reinstate the individual’s driver’s license or driving privileges as provided by law.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c03s49-326Aol12">
       Where the department is notified of the release of the individual, either by the court or the agency having custody over the individual during the period of confinement or imprisonment, the department shall amend its records to reflect the actual court-ordered period of suspension.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c03s49-326Aol13">
       No time credit against the court-ordered period of suspension will be given while the individual is incarcerated or if the individual is reincarcerated. The entire period of the court-ordered suspension must run after the individual is released from confinement or imprisonment.

        This section does not require driver’s license suspensions for felony eluding convictions to begin upon release from incarceration. It provides the procedure by which the department of motor vehicles administers driver’s license suspensions, when a court orders the suspension for any underlying offense to commence upon release from confinement. Therefore, this section mandates only that, if the court orders a driver’s license suspension to begin upon release from incarceration, the department must ensure its procedures follow that order.

       </p>
       <p>
        Suspension of a commercial driver’s license (CDL) did not violate a licensee’s procedural due process rights based on an allegation of a lack of notice, because any challenges to the evidentiary testing were precluded from being litigated prior to the CDL disqualification, as the licensee already had the opportunity to challenge the testing in an administrative license suspension proceeding. Peck v. Dep’t of Transp., 156 Idaho 112, 320 P.3d 1271 (Ct. App. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure to inform a driver of the consequence to his CDL, if he fails or refuses to perform an evidentiary test, is not violative of procedural due process, as a CDL license holder is presumed to know the consequences to his CDL if he is convicted of any offense listed in subsection (1) or if he fails or refuses an evidentiary test pursuant to subsection (2).

        One-year commercial driver’s license (CDL) disqualification was civil in nature and did not rise to the level of a criminal punishment for double jeopardy purposes; the driver was not denied due process because the CDL disqualification statute was not ambiguous as to the date the driver’s CDL disqualification was to begin, and estoppel was not an appropriate remedy against the Idaho department of transportation in this case.

        Lifetime commercial driver’s (CDL) disqualification under this section was civil in nature and did not rise to the level of a criminal punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Williams v.

       </p>
       <p>
        There is a distinction between a license and the privileges granted by that license. The disqualification of privileges does not impact one’s status as a holder of a license. A commercial driver’s license is distinct from the driving privileges granted under it, and a driver may still “hold” that license, despite being disqualified from exercising certain privileges.

Every application shall contain the owner’s Idaho driver’s license number, Idaho identification card number, social security number or individual taxpayer identification number. In the case of a business, the employer tax identification number is required. Every application shall also contain the owner’s true and full legal name. In the event that the owner does not possess a social security number, individual taxpayer identification number, Idaho driver’s license number, or Idaho identification card number, the owner shall present written documentation sufficient to the department to determine that no social security number has been issued. In the event that a business, trust or other statutorily created entity is not required to have and does not possess an employer tax identification number, the applicant shall provide a written statement certifying that the entity does not possess an employer tax identification number. Such application must be signed by the owner and contain his residence address and mailing address, if different, and a brief description of the vehicle to be registered, including the name of the maker, the type of fuel used, and the identification number. If an applicant has submitted an application pursuant to the provisions of chapter 58, title 19, Idaho Code, then the applicant may state in the application required pursuant to this section the applicant’s alternative Idaho mailing address in place of his or her residence address. Upon registration of a new vehicle, the application shall also show the date of sale by the manufacturer or dealer to the person first operating such vehicle. The application shall contain any other information as may be required by the department and shall contain a provision that allows an owner to choose to participate in the Idaho state parks passport program. The assessor shall issue to the applicant a receipt for any fee paid. Social security numbers collected shall not appear on certificates of registration, and all applications on file shall be exempt from disclosure, except as provided in sections 49-202, 49-203 and 49-203A, Idaho Code.

       <p>
        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 99, § 1, redesignated a former subsection (9) as subsection (8); and in the first sentence of present subsection (7) added “49-406,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c04s49-406" target="_self">49-406</a></cite>A,” preceding “49-410, 49-415”.

        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 135, § 2, redesignated a former subsection (9) as subsection (8); and in the first sentence of present subsection (7) added “49-404,” following “49-403,<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c04s49-403" target="_self">49-403</a></cite>A,”.
    This section was amended by five 1999 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together. In former subsection (8), the amendment by ch. 315 added a reference to section 49-418A to the list of special license plates for which there was a $35.00 fee, but the amendments by chapters 316, 365 and 374 all added a sentence to that same subsection stating that the special plates in section 49-418A would have a fee of $50.00.

       <p>
        Driver’s license and vehicle registration requirements constitute a legitimate exercise of the state’s police power. Licensing drivers is a means of determining that vehicle operators have acquired a minimal standard of competence. Requiring driver competence is a public purpose within the police power of the state, and the licensing procedure is a reasonable attempt to accomplish that purpose. The vehicle registration requirement also reasonably furthers protection of public health, safety and welfare and, as such, is a proper exercise of the state’s police power. Gordon v. State, 108 Idaho 178, 697 P.2d 1192 (Ct. App.), appeal dismissed, 474 U.S. 803, 106 S. Ct. 35, 88 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1985).

      § 49-403. Disabled veteran — License plates.
     </h3>
     <p>
      No fee shall be charged for the registration or reregistration of a motor vehicle owned by a veteran who has established his rights to benefits under the provisions of Public Law 662, 79th Congress, as amended, and Public Law 187, 82nd Congress, as amended. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any vehicle with a registered maximum gross weight over twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds, nor to any vehicle registered under section 49-434(5), Idaho Code. No fee shall be charged for the registration or reregistration of a motor vehicle owned by a veteran, who is at the time of the registration or reregistration receiving compensation from the veterans administration or in lieu thereof, from any of the armed forces of the United States, for one hundred percent (100%) service-connected disability or for any of the following specific disabilities: Loss or permanent loss of use of one (1) or both feet; loss or permanent loss of use of one (1) or both hands; loss of sight in both eyes or permanent impairment of vision in both eyes to the degree as to constitute virtual blindness. These provisions shall be considered applicable not only as to the vehicle originally purchased under this authorization, but also as to any vehicle subsequently purchased and owned by the same veteran, so long as the privilege shall not extend to more than one (1) vehicle at a time. Special license plates shall be issued for such a vehicle, identified by the inscription “D.V.”, and a separate number series shall be used to further identify the license plates so issued. These license plates shall not be issued by the counties but shall be issued by the department. The plates shall be displayed in accordance with the procedure applicable to license plates set forth in section 49-428, Idaho Code. A vehicle displaying plates issued in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be afforded the same privileges specified in section 49-410(7), Idaho Code.

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1992 acts — ch. 26, § 1 and ch. 261, § 4, both effective January 1, 1993. Both acts amended subsection (2) of the section and appeared to conflict and could not be compiled together. The amendments by ch. 261, as the latest expression of the legislature, were given effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (2) as amended by S.L. 1992, ch. 26, § 1 would have read: “(2) In addition to the regular operating fee, the applicant shall be charged the plate fee as provided in section 49-450, Idaho Code, except that the entire fee shall be deposited in the state highway account and shall be used to fund the cost of administration of this special license plate program which is provided to the public as a personal alternative to the standard license plate requirement. Whenever title or interest in a vehicle registered under the provisions of this section is transferred or assigned, the registration shall expire, but the purple heart recipient may transfer his plates to another vehicle upon payment of the required transfer fees. He may only display the plates after receipt of new registration from the department. A purple heart recipient shall not register more than two (2) vehicles under the provisions of this section.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1992 amendment, by ch. 261, § 4, in the present first sentence of subsection (2) substituted “registration” for “operating” preceding “In addition to the regular” at the beginning of the sentence and substituted “the plate fee required in section 49-450, Idaho Code” for “a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the initial issuance of plates, and fifteen dollars ($15.00) upon each succeeding annual registration. The initial fee and the annual fee shall be deposited in the state highway account and shall be used to fund the cost of administration of this special license plate program which is provided to the public as a personal alternative to the standard license plate requirement”, thereby combining the former first and second sentences and the present second sentence.
       </p>
       <p>

      § 49-405. Radio amateurs — Special license plates.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t49c04s49-405ol11">
       In order to enhance visibility and identification of radio amateurs during times of emergency any radio amateur residing in the state of Idaho, may, upon application to the department, register one (1) motor vehicle per radio license issued by the federal government and receive for that vehicle special license plates in lieu of regular license plates. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any vehicle with a registered maximum gross weight over twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds. The number on the plates shall be the same combination of figures and letters that make up the radio call sign of the amateur radio operator.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-405ol12">
       Proof of holding an amateur license from the federal communications commission must be furnished to the department before the plates will be issued. Should the amateur’s radio license expire during any given year and not be renewed, the special license plates must be surrendered to the department and regular license plates obtained.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-405ol13">
       Radio amateurs will notify the department at a time to be set by the department of their intention to procure special license plates under the terms specified in this section. Failure to do so will result in the amateur being required to accept regular license plates should the department be unable to procure the special plates. Special plates may still be procured when available but amateurs will be subject to the usual transfer fee.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-405ol14">
       Whenever an amateur transfers or assigns his title or interest to a vehicle especially registered the registration shall expire, but the amateur may hold his special license plates which he may have reissued to him upon the payment of the required transfer fees. He may only display the plates after receipt of new registration from the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-405ol15">
       In addition to the regular registration fees required in section 49-402(1) or 49-434(1), Idaho Code, the applicant shall pay the plate fee specified in section 49-450, Idaho Code.

A fee of three dollars ($3.00) shall be charged by the department for each vehicle. This fee shall be deposited in the state highway account to defray costs of the license plate program.

       <p>
        Subsection (2) as amended by S.L. 1992, ch. 26, § 2 would have read: “(2) In addition to the regular annual registration fee, the applicant shall be charged the plate fee as provided in section 49-450, Idaho Code, except that the fee shall be deposited in the state highway account and shall be used to fund the cost of administration of this special license plate program which is provided to the public as a personal alternative to the standard license plate requirement. Whenever a qualifying survivor of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, transfers or assigns his title or interest to a vehicle especially registered under this section, the registration shall expire, but the Pearl Harbor survivor may hold his special plates which he may have reissued to him upon the payment of the required transfer fees. He may only display those plates after receipt of a new registration from the department.”
    The 1992 amendment, by ch. 261, § 16, in subsection (1) added “or within three (3) miles of the island of Oahu” following “Harbor, Hawaii”, substituted “two (2)” for “one (1)” following “not more than”, and substituted “vehicles” for “vehicle” preceding “special Pearl”, in subsection (2) deleted “annual” preceding “In addition to the regular”, substituted “required in section 49-402 (1), Idaho Code” following “registration fee” and substituted “the plate fee required in section 49-450, Idaho Code” for “an initial fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the issuance of the plates and an annual renewal fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00). The initial fee and the annual fee shall be deposited in the state highway account and shall be used to fund the cost of administration of this special license plate program which is provided to the public as a personal alternative to the standard license plate requirement”, thereby merging the former first and second sentences into the present first sentence; and added a comma following “1941”, and in subsection (3) deleted “followed by three (3) numerals” following “Pearl Harbor Survivor’”.

       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 180, added “except as provided in subsection (4) of this section” at the end of the second sentence in subsection (3); and rewrote subsection (4), which formerly read: “The Idaho transportation board may designate sections of state highways over which all-terrain vehicles, utility type vehicles, specialty off-highway vehicles and motorbikes may cross. The requirements of title 18 and chapters 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 13 and 14, title 49, Idaho Code, shall apply to the operation of all-terrain vehicles, utility type vehicles, specialty off-highway vehicles and motorbikes when using designated crossings on state highways”.

        Where a trooper stopped defendant’s vehicle due to the improper display of his license plate, which was fastened with one bolt and hung at a 30-degree angle, defendant’s argument that this section was vague as applied to him failed; the plain and obvious meaning of the statutory requirement that a plate be securely fastened to the vehicle to prevent the plate from swinging clearly provided notice to the driver that fastening a license plate in a manner that did not prevent it from swinging violated the statute.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2001 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2001 amendment, by ch. 176, § 1, in subsection (1)(a), substituted “One hundred twenty (120)” for “Ninety-six (96)”; “$30.00” for “$25.00”; “$60.00” for “$50.00”; “$30.00” for “25.00”; and in former subsection (4), substituted “one hundred twenty (120)” for “ninety-six (96)”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2001 amendment, by ch. 355, § 2, in subsection (1), deleted “trip” following “may issue a”; in subsection (1)(a), deleted “trip” following “hour”; added subsection (2); added the present undesignated paragraph following subsection (2); redesignated a former subsection (2) as subsection (3); added a subsection (4); redesignated former subsections (3) and (4) as subsections (5) and (6); in subsection (5), deleted “trip” following “of selling”; substituted “three dollars ($3.00)” for “two dollars ($2.00)”; in former subsection (6), deleted “trip” following “hour” and inserted “the unladen” preceding “movement”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 58, added subsection (1)(c) and the undesignated paragraph following it and deleted former subsection (6) which read: “An owner-operator vehicle moving between lessee fleets where the vehicle registration was issued in the name of the former lessee, shall be eligible for a one hundred twenty (120) hour permit for the unladen movement from the point of entry into the state to the destination of the new lessee’s place of business.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 amendment, by ch. 336, in subsection (1), doubled the fee amounts and added the last paragraph; and in subsection (2)(b), deleted the listings for permits to increase gross vehicle weights for vehicles between 60,001 and 128,000 pounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 336, added subsection (3) and redesignated the subsequent subsections accordingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 330, inserted “where such combination of vehicles includes more than one (1) unregistered vehicles” in paragraph (1)(a).

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, because it failed to inform her of what she needed to do to comply with the section. All that the section appeared to require was that a permit be displayed in a location that rendered it readily legible and to be in that location while the vehicle is being driven. Nothing in the section required defendant to keep the permit clearly visible to the public or free from foreign material at all times. State v. Cook, — Idaho —, 444 P.3d 877 (2019).

        The state, even though motor carrier is engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, may impose nondiscriminatory tax or license fee for use of highways, if bearing a reasonable relation to privilege. Consolidated Freight Lines v. Pfost, 7 F. Supp. 629 (D. Idaho 1934).

        Presumption of Validity.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Presence of a properly displayed temporary permit carries with it a presumption of validity, not of invalidity. State v. Salois, 144 Idaho 344, 160 P.3d 1279 (Ct. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        A temporary permit displayed in compliance with this section carries with it a presumption of validity, not of invalidity. The mere existence of the properly placed temporary permit cannot serve as the basis for reasonable suspicion to allow an officer to stop a vehicle to inspect the permit unless the invalidity of the permit, such as by improper alteration, is obvious and discernible by the officer prior to stopping the vehicle. State v. Case, 159 Idaho 546, 363 P.3d 868 (Ct. App. 2015).

        Proper Display.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based on the plain language of subsection (4), a temporary permit is properly displayed only when it is both posted upon the windshield of each vehicle or in another prominent place and readily legible in that posted location, so a temporary permit is not properly displayed if it is not readily legible. State v. Kinch, 159 Idaho 96, 356 P.3d 389 (Ct. App. 2015).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported findings that defendant’s temporary permit was not legible as displayed, and a not readily legible temporary permit provided reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop, as it raised a reasonable and articulable suspicion beyond mere intuition or speculation that the temporary permit might be expired or invalid. State v. Kinch, 159 Idaho 96, 356 P.3d 389 (Ct. App. 2015). Registration by Nonresident.
       </p>
       <p>
        State statute requiring nonresident owners to register for motor vehicles engaged in transportation for compensation within the state, and imposing nondiscriminatory license fees for highway purposes based on weights, tires and capacity of vehicle, is applicable to a corporation owning a truck transporting interstate freight, and as so applied did not violate commerce clause.

      In addition to the registration fees provided for in this subsection, there shall be an additional registration fee imposed of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
    (2) There shall be paid on all commercial vehicles, irrespective of body type, and on all farm vehicles having a maximum gross weight in excess of sixty thousand (60,000) pounds, an annual registration fee in the amount prescribed by subsection (8) of this section, as applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) In addition, the annual registration fee for trailers shall be:
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) As an option to the trailer and semitrailer and rental utility trailer annual registrations issued pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the department may provide a nonexpiring plate and registration for trailers and semitrailers, and an optional, extended registration for rental utility trailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) For trailers and semitrailers, the nonexpiring registration fee shall be ninety-nine dollars ($99.00). The license plate shall remain on the trailer or semitrailer until the registration is canceled or revoked. No part of the fee is subject to refund. However, the registrant may transfer the nonexpiring plate and registration to another trailer or semitrailer titled to the registrant if the original registration date is prior to July 1, 2009. The registration document shall be the official record of the status of the nonexpiring registration, and no registration fee shall be required after the initial registration is paid. No validation sticker shall be issued for license plates assigned under this section. The owner may be issued an electronic copy of the registration card issued pursuant to this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Idaho-based trailer manufacturers may purchase trailer and semitrailer registration from the department. The manufacturer may issue the annual registration to foreign-based purchasers utilizing a manufacturer’s certificate of origin or manufacturer’s statement of origin as proof of ownership. If the foreign-based purchaser subsequently obtains an Idaho nonexpiring registration as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection prior to annual registration expiration, the amount of the annual registration fee shall be applied to the nonexpiring registration fee provided that the customer acquires a title for such vehicle.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) For rental utility trailers, the registrant may prepay the annual registration for an additional one (1), two (2), three (3) or four (4) years, but in no event shall the optional registration period extend beyond five (5) years. The fee shall be as specified in subsection (3)(b) or (c) of this section. The owner shall be issued a registration card or may request such card to be sent electronically. The expiration date shall be reflected on such registration card. The license plate shall become void if the owner’s interest in the rental utility trailer changes during the five (5) year period. If the owner fails to enter the rental utility trailer on the annual renewal application during the five (5) year period, the registration record shall be purged. Any unrenewed plate shall be returned to the department if it is not entered on the renewal application.
    (5) A fleet registration option is available to owners who have twenty-five (25) or more commercial or farm vehicles or any combination thereof. Such owners may register all of their company vehicles with the department in lieu of registering with a county assessor. To qualify, the fleet must be owned and operated under the unified control of one (1) person and the vehicles must be physically garaged and maintained in two (2) or more counties. Fleet registration shall not include fleets of rental vehicles. The department shall provide a registration application to the owner, and the owner shall provide all information that the department determines is necessary. The department shall devise a special license plate numbering system for fleet-registered vehicles as an alternative to county license plates. The fleet registration application and all subsequent registration renewals shall include the physical address where a vehicle is principally used, garaged and maintained. The fleet owner shall report the physical address to the department upon initial registration, on each renewal, and at any time a vehicle registered under this option is permanently transferred to another location.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) If the ownership of a vehicle changes during the registration period, the original owner may transfer the plate to another vehicle. The remaining fee shall be credited against the cost of the new registration. Refunds may be given for any unexpired portion of the vehicle registration fee if the plate is not transferred by the owner to another vehicle. Any request for refund shall include surrender of the license plate and registration document, if a physical document was issued. Owners of vehicles registered under the international registration plan may request a refund of the unexpired portion of the Idaho vehicle registration fee by presenting evidence from the base jurisdiction that the license plate and registration document, if a physical document was issued, have been surrendered. A license plate shall not be transferred to another owner when the ownership of a vehicle changes. The owner shall obtain a replacement plate, if required, and a printed or electronic registration document when a plate is lost, destroyed, or becomes illegible.
     </p>
     <p>
      (7) An administrative fee of four dollars ($4.00) shall be paid and deposited to the state highway account on all registrations completed by the department under subsection (1) or (8)(a) of this section. Vehicles registered under subsection (8)(b) of this section shall pay the fee provided in section 49-435(2), Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) There shall be paid on all commercial and farm vehicles having a maximum gross weight in excess of sixty thousand (60,000) pounds, a registration fee based upon the maximum gross weight of a vehicle as declared by the owner and the total number of miles driven on roads and highways in the state, county, city and highway district systems in Idaho, and if registered under the international registration plan (IRP), in all other jurisdictions. The appropriate registration fee shall be determined as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) If the owner registers vehicles under the international registration plan (IRP), the appropriate mileage column shall be determined by the total miles an owner operated a fleet of vehicles on roads and highways in the state, county, city and highway district systems in Idaho and in all other jurisdictions in the preceding year, as defined in section 49-117, Idaho Code, and by the maximum gross weight of each vehicle within a fleet.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) If the owner registers vehicles under the international registration plan and determines that the average international registration plan fleet miles, calculated by dividing the total IRP fleet miles in all jurisdictions by the number of registered vehicles, is less than fifty thousand one (50,001) miles, the owner may apply to the department for refund of a portion of the registration fees paid, consistent with the fee schedules set forth in this section. The department shall provide an application for the refund. An owner making application for refund under this section shall be subject to auditing as provided in section 49-439, Idaho Code.
    (c) If the owner is not registering vehicles under the international registration plan, the appropriate mileage column shall be determined by the total miles the owner operated each of the vehicles to be registered on roads and highways in the state, county, city and highway district systems in Idaho in the preceding year and by the maximum gross weight of each vehicle.

      In addition to the registration fees provided for in this subsection, there shall be an additional registration fee imposed of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      (9)(a) During the first registration year that the fee schedule in subsection (8)(c) of this section is in use, an owner shall use the mileage data from the records used to report the mileage use fee in the immediately preceding year as the basis for determining the appropriate registration fee schedule.

     <p>
      (b) Any owner who registers a motor vehicle for the first time and who has no mileage history for the vehicle shall estimate the miles to determine the appropriate fee schedule in subsection (8)(c) of this section.

        Amendments.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The amendment by S.L. 1993, ch. 399, § 1, near the end of the second sentence of subsection (4) substituted “9” for “7” preceding “of this section”. However, S.L. 1993, ch. 273 had deleted the words “subsection” and “of” and the parentheses that had previously enclosed the numeral “7”.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1994 acts — ch. 246, § 3, and ch. 311, § 2, both effective July 1, 1994 — which appear to make an identical amendment to this section, and have been compiled together. Both amendments added “and deposited to the state highway account” in subsection (3) preceding “on all registrations completed”.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 1998 acts — ch. 108, § 1, and ch. 392, § 11, both effective July 1, 1998, which do not conflict and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 108, § 1, inserted “and weigh less than the starting weights per axle configuration listed in column 1 of subsection (2), section 49-1004, Idaho Code” in subsection (11).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 392, § 11, rewrote subsections (3) and (4), added subsection (5), redesignated former subsections (5) through (12) as present subsections (6) through (14), in subsection (6), substituted “vehicle” for “trailer or semitrailer” throughout the subsection, substituted “license” for “extended”, deleted “A sticker validating the extended registration shall be affixed to the license plate”, inserted “if required”, deleted “from the department”, and inserted “becomes.”
    The 2007 amendment, by ch. 23, rewrote subsection (4) which formerly read: “As an option to the trailer and semitrailer annual registration, the department may provide extended registration.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) For trailers and semitrailers, the optional extended-registration period shall not extend beyond seven (7) years.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) The fee shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) The license plate originally issued shall remain on the trailer or semitrailer until the registration expires.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) The registration document shall be the official record of the status of the extended registration. No pressure-sensitive validation sticker shall be required.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) For rental utility trailers, the optional registration period shall not extend beyond five (5) years. The fee shall be as specified in subsection (3)(b) or (c) of this section. A pressure-sensitive sticker shall be used to validate the license plate. The license plate shall become void if the owner’s interest in the rental utility trailer changes during the five (5) year period. If the owner fails to enter the rental utility trailer on the annual renewal application during the five (5) year period, the registration record shall be purged. Any unrenewed plate shall be returned to the department if it is not entered on the renewal application.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 330, in the introductory paragraph in subsection (4), inserted “plate and”; rewrote the introductory paragraph in subsection (4)(a) to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable; and added subsections (4)(a)(i) and (4)(a)(ii).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2013 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 88, added “or a staggered registration fee for the purpose of reregistration and notice of expiration” in subsection (1).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 153, substituted “ninety-nine dollars ($99.00)” for “one hundred five dollars ($105)” in the first sentence of paragraph (4)(a); added paragraph (4)(b); and redesignated former paragraph (4)(b) as paragraph (4)(c).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 341, added the last sentence in subsection (1) and added the last sentence in paragraph (8)(c), following the table.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2020 amendment, by ch. 125, in subsection (4), rewrote the last sentence in the introductory paragraph, which formerly read: “No validation sticker shall be required or issued for such non-expiring license plates” and added the last sentence, and, in paragraph (c), rewrote the former third sentence, which formerly read: “A pressure sensitive sticker shall be used to validate the license plate”; in subsection (6), substituted “license plate and registration document, if a physical document was issued” for “license plate, validation sticker and registration document” at the end of the fourth and near the end of the fifth sentences and substituted “replacement plate, if required, and a printed electronic registration document” for “replacement plate, validation sticker if required, and a registration document” near the middle of the last sentence.

        Legislative Intent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 2 of S.L. 2001, ch. 185, read: “It is legislative intent that, contingent upon certification by the Secretary of State that he has received notice from the appropriate court of the Fourth Judicial District that the court has granted final approval of a settlement pursuant to Case No. CV OC 9700724D, American Trucking Association, et al. v. State of Idaho, et al., the following provisions setting forth the process for transitioning from a combination of registration fees and weight-distance use fees to a system of registration fees only, shall take effect as provided herein. These following provisions are both integral and necessary for the administration and implementation of the new registration system. It is legislative intent that the following provisions for vehicle registrations shall be in effect, subject to the contingencies stated above, from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2001. Subsection (5) shall continue to be in effect until the expiration of the applicable limitations period under that subsection.
    “(1) With regard to registrations for vehicles exceeding sixty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight which expired on December 31, 2000, the Idaho Transportation Department may accept payment for registration fees that will become effective on January 1, 2001, beginning October 1, 2000, and the owners 19 of those vehicles shall cease to accrue new liability for repealed weight-distance use fees on January 1, 2001, and shall be liable for the new registration fees on January 1, 2001. An owner shall pay at least one-quarter of the annual Idaho registration fee due. The remainder of the annual Idaho registration fee shall be paid in three equal installments on dates as billed by the department.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) With regard to registration under the International Registration Plan for foreign-based vehicles exceeding sixty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight which expire in any month beginning October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2001, the owners of those vehicles shall cease to accrue new liability for the repealed weight-distance use fees and shall be liable for the new registration fees on the first day of the month during which their registration is due. Owners of vehicles whose registration has not yet expired during a given calendar quarter shall continue to accrue, report and remit the weight-distance use fees until the quarter in which their registration expires under the repealed weight-distance statutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) With regard to registration under the International Registration Plan for Idaho-based vehicles exceeding sixty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight which expire in any month beginning October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2001, the owners of those vehicles shall have the option of converting from the weight-distance use fee system to the registration fee only system at the time their registration is scheduled to expire, or may convert any time during the period from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2001. At the time of conversion, the owner shall pay all weight-distance use fees due and shall pay at least one-quarter of the annual Idaho registration fee due, less any unexpired portion of registration fees already paid. The remainder of the annual Idaho registration fee shall be paid in three equal installments on dates as billed by the department.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) With regard to registration under the International Registration Plan for Idaho-based vehicles exceeding sixty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight which are being registered for the first time during the period from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2001, the owner shall pay at least one-quarter of the annual Idaho registration fee and shall pay all other amounts due and owing to all other jurisdictions in which the owner intends to operate. The remainder of the annual registration fee due to Idaho shall be paid in three 54 equal installments on dates as billed by the department.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) The Idaho Transportation Department may continue to enforce the repealed statutes addressing payment and collection of weight-distance use fees to audit and collect weight-distance use fees for the limitation period that would be in effect if the weight-distance use fees had not been repealed.”
    Section 10 of S.L. 2015, ch. 341 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that on or before January 1, 2019, there shall be imposed on all commercial vehicles, irrespective of body type, and on all farm vehicles having a maximum gross weight in excess of sixty thousand (60,000) pounds, an annual registration fee and in addition thereto, an operating fee by weight class based on the total miles the owner operated such vehicle on roads and highways in the state, county, city and highway district systems in Idaho during each quarter of the calendar year.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 11 of S.L. 2015, ch. 341 provided: “Legislative Intent. It is the intent of the Legislature that all additional funds collected under the provisions of this act, remitted to the Idaho Transportation Department or entities subject to the distribution provisions of Section 40-709, Idaho Code, shall be used exclusively for road and bridge maintenance and replacement projects both at the state and local level.”

        The legislative intent in enacting the 1991 amendment to subsection (2) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c04s49-436" target="_self">§ 49-436 </a></cite>was not to indicate that the department’s record keeping requirements were contrary to earlier legislative intent, but rather to narrow the earlier delegation of authority to the agency. The mere fact of the 1991 amendment did not compel the conclusion that the department was previously without authority to require record keeping by vehicle configuration prior to the effective date of the amendment. Because the regulations of the transportation regarding multiple weight reporting are reasonably directed to the accomplishment of purposes of the statutes under which they are established, they are not in conflict with the pre-1991 version of subsection (2) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c04s49-436" target="_self">§ 49-436 </a></cite>or the pre-1991 version of subsection (2) of this section. D &amp; D Trucking, Inc. v. Idaho Transp. Dep’t, 126 Idaho 417, 885 P.2d 376 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Transportation department’s regulations, requiring trucking company to keep records regarding multiple weight reporting, whereby the company was required to keep records of trips traveled by trucks registered at 82,000 pounds and those registered at 84,000 pounds, were not in conflict with nor beyond the scope of authority granted the department by this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c04s49-436" target="_self">§ 49-436</a></cite>. D &amp; D Trucking, Inc. v. Idaho Transp. Dep’t, 126 Idaho 417, 885 P.2d 376 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trucking company, for purposes of use taxes, failed to keep adequate records to distinguish which of its vehicles was entitled to be assessed at the lowest rate and which were subject to the highest rate, because the company failed to justify a lower rate by keeping adequate records which would indicate the vehicles that weighed 82,000 pounds and those that weighed 84,000 pounds, the department’s actions in raising assessment of all the vehicles to the highest registered weight, 84,000 pounds, was appropriate under subsection (2) of this section. D & D Trucking, Inc. v. Idaho Transp. Dep’t, 126 Idaho 417, 885 P.2d 376 (1994).

     <ol>
      <li id="t49c04s49-437ol11">
       When a motor vehicle registered under section 49-434 or 49-435, Idaho Code, has once been registered and during the year of that registration increases the maximum gross weight, the higher fee due for the weight increase shall be offset by the fee already paid. The fee already paid and the fee due shall be prorated by one-twelfth (1/12) for each month already expired in the registration period. The difference between the two (2) fees shall be the balance due for the remainder of the registration period. If an owner changes the weight during a registration period, the weight change shall not result in a refund of the fees already paid.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-437ol12">
       If a motor vehicle is not operated on any highway during the first months of a registration period, the owner may at any time thereafter be registered for the remainder of the registration period on payment of all fees, rounded to the nearest whole dollar, as provided in this chapter, less one-twelfth (1/12) of such fees for each full calendar month which has expired prior to registering, but in no event shall the minimum fee be less than five dollars ($5.00).

        The language contained in this section is clear, explicit and unambiguous and will not sustain the construction contended for by respondent that the intent of the legislature was to penalize one who operates a vehicle upon the highways when its maximum gross weight exceeds the declared and registered maximum gross weight. The court is not at liberty to enlarge, by construction, the words to include other conduct, when it is not fairly included in the plain language of the act. State v.

        Defendant’s three separate fines for his three weight violations did not violate double jeopardy, because defendant’s registered gross weight violation was a separate offense from each of defendant’s two axle weight violations under the
    Blockburger v. United States
    , 284 U.S. 299 (1932) test, and the Idaho legislature clearly authorized cumulative punishment for defendant’s two axle weight violations; a registered gross weight violation required the state to prove that defendant had exceeded the weight at which he registered his tractor-trailer, and the elements to prove defendant exceeded the allowable weight limits for his tandem drive axle and his four axle bridge did not require the state to prove the defendant’s registered weight.

        The conduct complained of on the part of the truck and trailer combination was the operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles upon the highways of the state carrying a weight in excess of the declared or registered gross weight, but since under this section the failure to pay either the required registration fee or the use fee was a necessary element of such offense or violation and the admitted fact that the driver had at the time of the alleged violation paid the maximum registration fee would bar a conviction of an offense punishable under this section.

       The assessor or the department shall furnish to every owner whose vehicle is registered or licensed by that office, pursuant to sections 49-402 and 49-402A, Idaho Code, one (1) license plate for vehicles registered under the provisions of section 49-406, 49-406A or 49-408, Idaho Code, or a motorcycle, trailer, truck-tractor, or semitrailer; one (1) restricted vehicle license plate for all-terrain vehicles, utility type vehicles and motorbikes licensed pursuant to this chapter; and two (2) license plates for every other motor vehicle. If a vehicle is issued one (1) plate only, that plate shall be displayed in accordance with the provisions of section 49-428, Idaho Code. For vehicles registered under the provisions of section 49-407, Idaho Code, the applicant shall provide one (1) plate to be displayed on the rear of the vehicle.

       If a license plate number has expired as provided in subsection (2) of this section and is not renewed within sixty (60) days of its expiration, the plate number shall be available for use by another registrant. To obtain a specific number in the recycled license plate number file, the owner of a registered vehicle may contact the county regarding availability.
    The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to vehicles registered under the provisions of section 49-402(1), Idaho Code, and section 49-434(1), Idaho Code, as it applies to noncommercial vehicles.
      </li>

       License plates issued for vehicles required to be registered in accordance with the provisions of sections 49-402 and 49-402A, Idaho Code, shall be issued color-coded red, white or blue registration validation stickers showing the year of registration. Each registration validation sticker shall bear a number from 1 through 12, which number shall correspond to the month of the calendar year in which the registration of the vehicle expires and shall be affixed to the lower right-hand corner of the plates within the outlined rectangular area.

       License plates for utility trailers registered under the provisions of section 49-402A, Idaho Code, that are issued for five (5) or ten (10) years and license plates for rental utility trailers registered under the provisions of section 49-434, Idaho Code, that are issued for up to five (5) years shall use the design in effect on the date of manufacture. If a design change occurs, plates from the effective date of the design change shall be manufactured using the new design. Unexpired plates need not be reissued to conform to a design change.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-443ol16">
       For license plates that are lost, stolen, mutilated, or illegible, the owner shall apply for a duplicate or substitute. The assessor shall also furnish for each registration, and to validate the license plate, a pressure-sensitive, uniquely numbered, color-coded red, white or blue registration sticker, except for trailers and semitrailers registered under the provisions in section 49-434, Idaho Code. License plates issued for state, county and city motor vehicles shall be valid for ten (10) years pursuant to subsection (2) of this section and remain on the vehicle for which issued from year to year, and need no renewal or validation sticker.

       Whenever a vehicle is completely destroyed by fire or accident and the operator submits satisfactory proof of that destruction to the department or appropriate assessor’s office, or the owner wishes to transfer the remaining registration, use increment and fees shall be transferred to the replacement vehicle for a service transfer fee of five dollars ($5.00), which fee shall be retained by the registering authority. None of the original fees shall be subject to refund.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c04s49-443ol18">
       The department shall furnish a printed or an electronic copy of the registration card to every owner whose vehicle is registered under sections 49-434 and 49-435, Idaho Code. [-]

      Commencing January 1, 1992, the color and design of the plates shall be comparable to the color and design of the statehood centennial issue of license plates with blue numerals and letters on a multicolored red, white and blue background. Each license plate must bear upon its face the inscriptions “Famous Potatoes” and “Scenic Idaho.” The restricted vehicle license plate for all-terrain vehicles, utility type vehicles and motorbikes shall be a white background with black numerals and letters, with “Idaho Restricted Vehicle” and the year of its expiration on its face and no other inscription. The restricted vehicle license plate shall be the same size required for the motorcycle license plate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every license plate shall have displayed upon it the registration number assigned to the vehicle and its owner and the name “Idaho” which may be abbreviated. The plates issued under the provisions of section 49-402(1), Idaho Code, and the required letters and numerals, including an identification of the county in which the motor vehicle to which the plates will be affixed is registered, shall be of sufficient size to be plainly readable from a distance of seventy-five (75) feet during daylight, and each license plate and registration sticker shall be treated with a fully reflectorized material according to specifications prescribed by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      For specialty license plate programs discontinued pursuant to the provisions of section 49-402C, Idaho Code, a registrant with a specialty license plate currently registered under the program may use such license plate for up to ten (10) years from the date of issuance. This provision is intended to permit the use of the specialty plate by the registrant regardless of the number of persons who purchase the specialty plate. The registrant shall be required to pay the special plate program fees provided for specialty plates pursuant to this chapter. Such fees shall be deposited into the state highway account. For purposes of section 49-434, Idaho Code, as it applies to commercial vehicles, and section 49-435, Idaho Code, the department shall provide new plates bearing the same number or, upon request from the registered owner, the next available number.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 2014 amendment, by ch. 38, deleted the former last four sentences in the first paragraph of subsection (2), which read: “The department shall implement a plate-number reservation program beginning prior to the 1999 plate issue and following once every seven (7) years thereafter, for a limited plate-number sequence in each county that chooses to offer a reservation program. Requests for license plate number reservations shall be submitted to the county during the open reservation period established by the department. The department may charge a minimal fee as determined by the board to recover costs to the department for reservation of license plate numbers. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any license plates issued pursuant to the provisions of section 49-434(4), Idaho Code”; in the first paragraph of subsection (3), deleted “the number was not reserved, or if the vehicle registration” preceding “is not renewed” in the first sentence and substituted “may contact the county regarding availability” for “shall pay a one (1) time fee as determined by rule of the board” in the second sentence; inserted “red, white or blue” in the first sentence of subsection (4); substituted “uniquely numbered, color coded red, white or blue” for “uniquely-numbered” in subsections (6) and (8); substituted “valid for seven (7) years pursuant to subsection (2) of this section” for “permanent” in the last sentence in subsection (6); and substituted “or the owner wishes to transfer the remaining registration” for “the registration” in the first sentence in subsection (7).

      § 49-450. Additional fee for each plate issued.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the vehicle registration fee provided by law, whenever any plate is issued for vehicle registration, there shall be charged a fee of three dollars and seventy-five cents ($3.75) per plate, which shall be deposited into the plate manufacturing account created in section 49-450A, Idaho Code. The actual cost of producing and distributing license plates and the fifty cents (50¢) per plate fee designated to the Idaho heritage trust for the use of the copyrighted design provided for in section 49-443(1), Idaho Code, shall be paid from the plate manufacturing account. The difference between deposits into the account and disbursements out of the account not anticipated for future production cost increases, shall be transferred by the state controller from the plate manufacturing account to the highway distribution account as established in section 40-701, Idaho Code, for apportionment as designated in that section. Funds designated to the Idaho heritage trust shall be matched with equal funds from other sources for funding projects designed to preserve Idaho’s historic resources.

     <p>
      There is hereby created in the state treasury an account to be known as the “plate manufacturing account” for the purpose of paying the actual cost to produce and distribute license plates and to pay costs related to use of the centennial design on the license plate. All moneys in this account are hereby continuously appropriated to the department. Any additional funds required to pay plate production and distribution costs will be transferred by the state controller from the state highway account. Once an adequate cash balance has accumulated in the plate manufacturing account, the state controller will transfer funds from the plate manufacturing account to reimburse the state highway account.

       <p>
        It is not a constitutional violation for an officer to exercise his discretion to check to see if a vehicle is stolen if the license plate has been cancelled, revoked, suspended, or altered; therefore, opening the door of the vehicle to check the vehicle identification number did not rise to the level of a constitutionally prohibited search.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Granting of defendant’s motion to suppress the physical evidence and her statements made to police during a traffic stop was correct because the proper display of a temporary permit carried with it a presumption of validity and there was evidence that the permit was visible to the officer prior to the stop. Thus, the officer stopped defendant’s vehicle without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. State v. Salois, 144 Idaho 344, 160 P.3d 1279 (Ct. App. 2007).

        A temporary permit displayed in compliance with<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c04s49-432" target="_self">§ 49-432 </a></cite>carries with it a presumption of validity, not of invalidity. The mere existence of the properly placed temporary permit cannot serve as the basis for reasonable suspicion to allow an officer to stop a vehicle to inspect the permit unless the invalidity of the permit, such as by improper alteration, is obvious and discernible by the officer prior to stopping the vehicle. State v. Case, 159 Idaho 546, 363 P.3d 868 (Ct. App. 2015).

        All parties to an arrangement whereby plaintiff authorized a dealer to sell a truck to the defendant, although plaintiff retained title, are held to have notice that no person may acquire any right, title, claim, or interest in a motor vehicle until the issuance of a certificate of title to the buyer. Lux v. Lockridge, 65 Idaho 639, 150 P.2d 127 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the automobile was registered and title thereto issued in the name of the wife does not conclusively establish the title in her as separate property, such result not being the intent or purpose of the motor vehicle act; and where there was no gift or other transfer by the husband to her and the automobile had been purchased with community funds, it became community property. Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Wendler, 84 Idaho 114, 368 P.2d 933 (1962).
    This section explicitly provides that issuance of a certificate of title is required for acquisition of title and places the burden of acquiring a certificate of title upon the buyer—not the seller. Where the defendant endorsed the certificate of title and delivered same to his ex-wife prior to the accident, he did all that was required to effect a legal transfer of his title in the vehicle prior to the accident.

        This section was not applicable in bankruptcy proceeding involving avoidance, and the transfer date of a security interest, where vehicle was sold without issuance of a new title to the dealer, through the dealer’s reassignment of an existing certificate of title. Fitzgerald v. First Sec. Bank (In re Walker), 161 Bankr. 484 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1993), aff’d, 178 Bankr. 497 (D. Idaho 1994), aff’d, 77 F.3d 322 (9th Cir. 1996).

        Although debtors had attempted to sell a vehicle pre-petition, because the debtors were still listed on the vehicle’s certificate of title as the owners on the petition date, it was property of the bankruptcy estate. The court rejected the purported buyers’ argument that the vehicle was held in a constructive trust because no court had imposed such a trust, and, moreover, the Idaho legislature had statutorily defined the equities by adopting a comprehensive system of registering ownership interests in titled vehicles. In re Woods, 386 B.R. 758 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a bankruptcy debtor sold an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) prior to filing a bankruptcy petition, the sale was avoidable as an unauthorized postpetition transfer since the transferee did not obtain a new certificate of title prior to the bankruptcy; thus, title to the ATV remained in the debtor on the petition date and the ATV became property of the bankruptcy estate. Gugino v. Knezevich (In re Pegram), 395 B.R. 692 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2008).

        Although a debtor’s name was removed from a boat’s title for no consideration at a time when he was insolvent, summary judgment was not granted in favor of a trustee in his action to avoid the transfer under 11 U.S.C.S. § 548(a)(1)(B), as there was a question of material fact concerning the value of the debtor’s interest that was transferred to the co-owner; the fact that, under this section and subsection (3) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c70s67-7039" target="_blank">§ 67-7039</a></cite>, the debtor had the authority to sell the boat while his name was on the title, and gave up that right when his name was removed from the title, required valuing the interest he transferred and any gain he realized from the transfer in the form of decreased liability for such items as maintenance and upkeep.

        Chapter 7 trustee had the right to sell a vehicle which debtor’s mother titled in her name and the debtor’s name, even though the debtor did not know that her name was on the title and the mother titled the vehicle in both names so that the debtor could avoid probate if her mother predeceased her. Vehicle ownership is determined exclusively by reference to the names on the title certificate, and a lien creditor was justified in assuming that the debtor held an ownership interest in her mother’s truck.

        Where defendant gave plaintiffs an option to purchase two oil trucks, and at the same time gave them possession of the trucks under an operation contract, and defendant thereafter seized trucks without process, plaintiffs had sufficient right of possession to sue defendant for conversion, though defendant had not issued certificates of title to the plaintiff.

        Although no certificate of title was issued under this section, sufficient indicia of ownership existed so that a vehicle was considered property of a Chapter 7 debtor’s bankruptcy estate: the sales contract clearly provided that the debtor was purchasing the vehicle from the creditor, possession was transferred to debtor, and debtor remained in possession of the vehicle through the bankruptcy petition date.

       Application for a certificate of title shall be made upon a form furnished by the department and shall contain the owner’s Idaho driver’s license number, Idaho identification card number or social security number or individual taxpayer identification number. In the case of a business, the employer tax identification number is required. Every application shall also contain the owner’s true and full legal name. In the event that the owner does not possess a social security number, Idaho driver’s license number, Idaho identification card number or individual taxpayer identification number, the owner shall present written documentation sufficient to the department to determine that no social security number has been issued. In the event that a business, trust, or other statutorily created entity is not required to have and does not possess an employer tax identification number, the applicant shall provide a written statement certifying that the entity does not possess an employer tax identification number. The form must contain the owner’s physical domicile address or in the case of a business, trust or other statutorily created entity, such entity’s physical address and any mailing address if different from the physical address. If the owner has submitted an application pursuant to the provisions of chapter 58, title 19, Idaho Code, then the owner may state, in the application required pursuant to this section, the applicant’s alternative Idaho mailing address in place of his or her physical domicile address. Such application must be signed by the owner and contain a full description of the vehicle including the make, identification numbers, and the odometer reading at the time of sale or transfer, and whether the vehicle is new or used, together with a statement of the applicant’s title and of any liens or encumbrances upon the vehicle, and the name and address of the person to whom the certificate of title shall be delivered, and any other information as the department may require. The application shall be filed with the department, and if a certificate of title has previously been issued for that vehicle in this state, shall be accompanied by the certificate of title duly assigned, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter. The department may promulgate rules to provide for exceptions to the odometer requirement. Social security numbers collected shall not appear on certificates of title and all applications on file shall be exempt from disclosure, except as provided in sections 49-202, 49-203 and 49-203A, Idaho Code.

A copy of this application shall be given to the purchaser to be used as a seventy-two (72) hour temporary permit. In all other cases the certificates shall be obtained by the purchaser and the certificate of title properly assigned and dated by the seller, or the seller’s bill of sale shall serve as a seventy-two (72) hour permit. The seventy-two (72) hour time period for temporary permits shall be calculated excluding weekend days and legal holidays observed by the state of Idaho. This temporary permit allows operation of any noncommercial vehicle or unladened commercial vehicle or vehicle combination without license plates for the period of time specified in the permit.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 283, § 1, added the subsection designation “(1)”; and added a subsection (2).

        The 1993 amendment, by ch. 298, § 2, rewrote the third paragraph in this section.

       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 66, designated the former second and third paragraphs of subsection (1) as subsections (2) and (3); in subsection (2), substituted “date of receipt” for “date of the creation of the lien or encumbrance” at the end of the first sentence, rewrote the second sentence, which formerly read: “A lien is perfected as of the time of its creation if the transaction is notarized and if the filing is completed with the department or an agent of the department within twenty (20) calendar days thereafter; otherwise, as of the date of the filing with the department or an agent of the department,” and deleted the former last sentence, which read: “If the title application is incomplete or if the supporting documents are incomplete or missing, the title application and supporting documents as submitted will be returned to the lienholder or his successor, agent or assignee for correction and, if the application is not resubmitted in a complete form, including completed supporting documents, to the department or to the agent of the department within twenty (20) days of their having been returned to the lienholder or his successor, agent or assignee, the original date of receipt by the department or agent of the department shall be void”; and deleted former subsection (2), which read: “The notarization requirement set out in the second paragraph of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to transactions involving a lien in favor of a regulated lender, as defined in section 28-41-301(37), Idaho Code, or a motor vehicle dealer licensed by the Idaho transportation department.”

        The rule of comity that liens or chattel mortgages, properly perfected according to the laws of the state where executed and where the property covered was found at that time, continue to have priority even after the removal of the property, at least if removal is without knowledge and consent of mortgagor or conditional vendor, to another state over rights and claims acquired in such latter state of purchasers from the creditors of the mortgagor or conditional vendor is not affected by this section. Pacific Fin. Corp. v. Axelsen, 84 Idaho 70, 368 P.2d 430 (1962).
    Creditors’ liens were vulnerable to a trustee’s preference claim under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 547(b) and 550(a), even though the vehicles were purchased more than 90 days before the debtors filed their bankruptcy petition, because the vehicles would likely be deemed perfected under subsection (3) of this section outside of the 30-day grace period in light of the fact that the date was changed on the electronic title from August 2007 to November 2007 in the process of correcting errors concerning the creditor’s mailing address in the state’s electronic records.

        According to the language of this section, not only must a lienholder file the proper paperwork with the agency to have its security interest deemed perfected under state law, but the notation of that security interest on the actual title certificate is another distinct “condition of perfection”; additionally under this section, a security interest is deemed perfected according to the date noted by the state on the title certificate. Fitzgerald v. First Sec. Bank (In re Walker), 161 Bankr. 484 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1993), aff’d, 178 Bankr. 497 (D. Idaho 1994), aff’d, 77 F.3d 322 (9th Cir. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The creditor must provide the lien creation date on the title certificate application in order for the state to perform its duty of noting the recording date on the title certificate; failure to note this crucial information is just as fatal to proper perfection of a lien as would be neglecting to supply the name of the lienholder. Fitzgerald v. First Sec. Bank (In re Walker), 161 Bankr. 484 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1993), aff’d, 178 Bankr. 497 (D. Idaho 1994), aff’d, 77 F.3d 322 (9th Cir. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a security interest is deemed perfected on the date noted by the state on the title certificate, creditors’ liens were vulnerable to a trustee’s preference claim under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 547(b) and 550(a), even though the vehicles were purchased more than 90 days before the debtors filed their bankruptcy petition, because the date was changed on the electronic title from August 2007 to November 2007 in the process of correcting errors concerning the creditor’s mailing address in the state’s electronic records; thus, the creditor’s motion pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. Rule 9019, to approve a proposed settlement of a pending adversary proceeding against the creditor was rejected as too generous and not in the best interests of the parties in interest as required by 11 U.S.C.S. § 704(a)(1).

     </h3>
     <p>
      In the event of the transfer of ownership of a vehicle by operation of law, as upon inheritance, devise or bequest, order in bankruptcy, insolvency, replevin, or execution sale, or whenever a vehicle is sold to satisfy storage or repair charges, or if the interest of the owner is terminated or the vehicle is sold under a security agreement, the department may upon the surrender of the prior certificate of title, or when that is not possible, upon presentation of satisfactory proof to the department of ownership and right to possession of the vehicle and presentation of an application for a certificate of title, issue to the applicant a certificate of title. Only an affidavit by the person or agent of the person to whom possession of the vehicle so passed, setting forth facts entitling him to possession and ownership, together with a copy of the journal entry, court order or instrument upon which the claim of possession and ownership is founded, shall be considered satisfactory proof of ownership and right of possession. If the applicant cannot produce proof of ownership he may apply directly to the department and submit any evidence as he may have, and the department shall, if it finds the evidence sufficient, issue a certificate of title to the applicant.
     </p>
     <p>
      If from the records in the office of the department there appears to be any prior lien or liens on the vehicle, the certificate of title shall contain a statement of those liens, unless the application is accompanied by proper evidence of their satisfaction or discharge.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the death of the owner of one (1) or more registered vehicles, the following heirs of the owner, to wit: the surviving spouse, the children, lawful issue of the deceased children, the parents, the brothers or sisters, or the guardian of the estate of any minor or insane or incompetent person having such relationship to the owner, if such person has a right to succeed to the property of the owner, may secure a transfer of the certificate or certificates of title of the owner to the vehicle or vehicles, upon presenting to the department the appropriate certificate or certificates of title, if available, and an affidavit of the person or persons setting forth the fact of survivorship or heirship, the names and addresses of any other heirs, that the decedent died intestate, that the decedent has no creditors, that the decedent did not leave other property necessitating probate, and if required by the department, a certificate of the death of the deceased. The department, when satisfied of the genuineness and regularity of the transfer, shall transfer the registrations and titles accordingly.

        Because a security interest is deemed perfected on the date noted by the state on the title certificate, creditors’ liens were vulnerable to a trustee’s preference claim under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 547(b) and 550(a), even though the vehicles were purchased more than 90 days before the debtors filed their bankruptcy petition, because the date was changed on the electronic title from August 2007 to November 2007 in the process of correcting errors concerning the creditor’s mailing address in the state’s electronic records; thus, the creditor’s motion pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. Rule 9019 to approve a proposed settlement of a pending adversary proceeding against the creditor was rejected as too generous and not in the best interests of the parties in interest as required by 11 U.S.C.S. § 704(a)(1).

      If the department shall determine an applicant for a certificate of title to a vehicle is not entitled to it, it shall refuse to issue a certificate or to register the vehicle, and in that event unless the department reverses its decision or its decision is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the applicant shall have no further right to apply for a certificate of title or registration on the statements in the application. The department may for a like reason after notice and hearing, revoke registration already acquired or any outstanding certificate of title.

       If the department is not satisfied as to the ownership of the vehicle or that there are no undisclosed security interests in it, the department may register the vehicle, but shall either:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t49c05s49-523ol11a">

The bond shall be in an amount equal to one and one-half (1 ½) times the value of the vehicle, as determined by the department, and conditioned to indemnify any prior owner and secured party and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle or person acquiring any security interest in it, and their respective successors in interest, against any expense, loss or damage, including reasonable attorney’s fees, by reason of the issuance of the certificate of ownership of the vehicle, or on account of any defect in or disclosed security interest upon the right, title and interest of the applicant in and to the vehicle. Any such interested person has a right of action to recover on the bond for any breach of its conditions, but the aggregate liability of the surety to all persons shall not exceed the amount of the bond. The bond, or any cash deposit, shall be returned at the end of three (3) years, or prior to that time if the vehicle is no longer registered in this state and the current valid certificate of ownership is surrendered to the department, unless the department has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover on the bond.

         As to a vehicle at least ten (10) model years old, an applicant who is a resident of the state of Idaho may file with the department, before its authorized representative, a verified statement of facts setting out in detail the manner in which the applicant came into possession of the vehicle, the establishment of ownership, and a summary of the applicant’s attempts to contact any prior owners of the vehicle. Upon receipt by the department of the verified statement and all documentation relating to the applicant’s possession of the vehicle, and completion of an inspection of the vehicle identification number by an authorized representative of the department, the applicant shall execute a document in the form provided by the department releasing it of any and all damages that may be suffered by the applicant, along with warranties that the applicant will pay any and all damages suffered by any person or entity as to the issuance of a title for that vehicle by the department. The department shall then issue a certificate of title to the applicant in a form set out by this section. The certificate of title shall include the statement, “ISSUED ON STATEMENT OF APPLICANT,” in permanent letters upon its face. The title issued pursuant to this subsection shall be presumed to indicate legal ownership of the vehicle at the end of the three (3) year period from the date of issue of that title, provided the vehicle is still registered in the state of Idaho, and there are no actions or claims pending against the applicant which place legal ownership in question. The department and the state of Idaho shall be immune as to any damages suffered by any person or entity as a result of the issuance of a certificate of title as provided by this subsection.
    (2) Every dealer desiring the privilege of issuing temporary registration permits for the operation of vehicles shall make application to the department. If the privilege is granted, the dealer will receive a series of permits, consecutively numbered by the department, secured by the dealer at a fee of nine dollars ($9.00) for each permit. A permit subsequently issued by a dealer to a purchaser shall be valid for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The dealer shall issue temporary registration permits in numerical sequence, one (1) only for each vehicle sold to a bona fide purchaser. Each permit, and the attached stub, shall be completed in duplicate, in ink or by typewriter at the time of issuance. The expiration date on the original permit shall be filled in by rubber stamp or broad-tipped marking pen, and the print shall be at least three-fourths (¾) inch high and one-eighth (1/8) inch wide. The original permit shall be displayed in the rear window of the vehicle for which it is issued, except when issued for a convertible, station wagon, motorcycle, or other vehicle for which this would not be practical. In these exceptional cases, the permit should be conspicuously displayed in a place where the number of the permit and the expiration date may be easily read and where protected from exposure to weather conditions which would render it illegible.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) The dealer shall keep a written record of every temporary registration permit issued. This record shall include the name and address of the person or firm to whom the permit is issued, a description of the vehicle for which it is issued, including year, make, model, identification number, and the date of issue. This record shall list all permits in numerical sequence and shall be open to inspection by any peace officer or designated employee of the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) The fees collected from dealers by the department under the provisions of this section shall be transmitted by the department to the state treasurer for deposit in the highway distribution account.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) Upon application for title and for registration of a vehicle for which temporary registration has been issued under this section, the county assessor shall collect and fees shall be deemed due from the date of issuance of the temporary registration permit rather than from the date of application for title or registration.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) The department or a county assessor may issue temporary vehicle registration permits in an emergency situation. The fee for a temporary registration shall be nine dollars ($9.00) and shall be valid for a period of thirty (30) days. The temporary fees collected by the department shall be transmitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the highway distribution account. Temporary fees collected by an assessor shall be distributed as follows: five dollars ($5.00) shall be deposited in the county current expense fund and four dollars ($4.00) shall be transmitted to the department for deposit through the state treasurer in the highway distribution account.

    (8) It is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six (6) months in jail, a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or both, if the owner of a retained salvage vehicle fails to surrender the title and be issued a salvage certificate of title, or to sell the vehicle and not tell the buyer that the vehicle is totaled.

      (11) If an insurer has acquired a vehicle in a settlement of a theft claim, has made application to and has been issued a new salvage certificate of title in the name of the insurer and the vehicle is subsequently recovered and is not damaged to the extent that it is a salvage vehicle, the insurer may complete an affidavit indemnifying the department stating the facts of acquisition and disposition of the vehicle in a form prescribed by the department and deliver the salvage certificate of title of ownership, affidavit and any other documents required by the department to the transferee at the time of delivery of the vehicle. When these documents are submitted with an application for title, the subsequent title for the vehicle will not be issued with the brand “rebuilt salvage” based on the theft incident, but a notation of “theft recovery” shall be made on the title certificate and title record.

     <p>
      (12) Any person acquiring ownership of a salvage vehicle purchased in a state or jurisdiction that does not require surrender of the certificate of title or comparable ownership document shall, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the certificate of title or ownership document, surrender such title or document to the department and apply for a salvage certificate of title.

      § 49-527. Purpose of transitional ownership document.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of a transitional ownership document is to enable security interest to be perfected in a timely manner when the primary ownership document is not available. The transitional ownership document serves to perfect a lien against creditors or subsequent purchasers.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t49c05s49-527ol11">
       To perfect a security interest the transitional ownership document must be received by the department or agent within thirty (30) days of the date of sale. To determine the thirty (30) days, exclude the first day (i.e., date of sale) and count each calendar day thereafter. If the thirtieth day falls on a weekend or holiday it is not counted; the last date the transitional ownership document will be accepted is the following business day of the department or agent.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-527ol12">
       The lien will be perfected as of the date and time of filing consistent with section 49-510, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-527ol13">
       The transitional ownership document is not intended to supersede the requirements of section 49-504, Idaho Code, but rather to provide an alternative method of lien perfection.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c05s49-527ol14">
       Once a transitional ownership document has been filed with the department or agent, the primary ownership document must be received by the department or agent within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the security agreement or contract. To determine ninety (90) days, exclude the first day (i.e., day of sale) and count each calendar day thereafter. If the ninetieth day falls on a weekend or holiday, the last date the transitional ownership document may be used to determine date of security interest perfection is the following business day of the department or agent.

        Security interest granted to a creditor by debtor under a contract was required to be perfected under Idaho law prior to debtor’s bankruptcy petition day, in order for the creditor to prevail as against a Chapter 7 trustee’s powers. Where the creditor failed to comply with the lien notation requirements of the Idaho motor vehicle certificate of title laws, its resort to a transitional ownership document method of lien perfection was not proper, as the creditor was in possession of the primary ownership document at all relevant times.

       <p>
        Where the defendant could not find the keys to his car and left it on a residential street from which it was apparently stolen and involved in a collision with three parked cars, the plaintiff owner of one of the parked cars could not recover civil damages under law regarding owner’s tort liability for negligence of another, on a theory that the defendant by leaving his keys in the car in violation of this section gave implied consent to an unknown third party driver to use the car, since the act of the unknown party in taking the car and then driving it negligently was an intervening force which constituted a superseding cause to the defendant’s presumed negligence, and since, as a matter of law, violation of statutes like this section cannot be the proximate cause of an accident arising from the intervening activity of an interloper who has taken the vehicle. Gamble v. Kinch, 102 Idaho 335, 629 P.2d 1168 (1981). Unauthorized Use of Unattended Vehicle.
       </p>
       <p>
        The former section which prohibited leaving the engine running in an unattended vehicle was a deterrent to theft and a safety device designed to protect members of the public from damage caused by the operation of a motor vehicle by an unauthorized person and did not in and of itself imply consent for an employee to use a vehicle owned by an employer and left unattended with the key remaining in the ignition lock.

        In a personal injury action, the jury reasonably could have concluded that although the pedestrian/plaintiff entered the intersection in a negligent manner, the driver was also negligent in failing to observe the plaintiff in the intersection. Smith v. Praegitzer, 113 Idaho 887, 749 P.2d 1012 (Ct. App. 1988).

       <p>
        In action for damages due to collision between car and motorcycle, where jury could find that seven-year-old plaintiff motorcycle rider was a special hazard and that defendant could have exercised proper precaution under this section, there was no basis to find that defendant owed no duty to plaintiff and that defendant’s conduct as a matter of law could not be the proximate cause of the accident and, thus, court erred in issuing order for summary judgment. Robinson v. Westover, 101 Idaho 766, 620 P.2d 1096 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section clearly imposes a duty on a driver to sound his horn when necessary. Rife v. Long, 127 Idaho 841, 908 P.2d 143 (1995).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The refusal to give certain instructions under the circumstances presented was not error where court’s instructions adequately covered the requested instructions, such requested instructions involving speed of an automobile under certain circumstances, rights and duties of pedestrians and the place of walking for pedestrians. Lallatin v. Terry, 81 Idaho 238, 340 P.2d 112 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The error, if any, committed by the court in embodying the former section requiring drivers to exercise due care in an instruction in a pedestrian injury case was negatived by the giving of an instruction admonishing the jury to consider all instructions together as a whole and not to put emphasis on some and disregard others, and of an instruction on the duty of pedestrians on roadways as prescribed by the former law. Loomis v. Hannah, 89 Idaho 358, 404 P.2d 568 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        An instruction in the language of the former section requiring drivers to exercise due care was not erroneous as requiring a motorist to sound his horn regardless of whether he knew or should have known of the presence of a pedestrian in the roadway. Nichols v. Sonneman, 91 Idaho 199, 418 P.2d 562 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction to jury that required a standard of due care dependent upon the particular facts existing, i.e., the presence of small children, was not inconsistent with law that provided that drivers should exercise due care to avoid collisions with pedestrians and did not require a higher degree or standard of care than ordinary care. Davis v. Bushnell, 93 Idaho 528, 465 P.2d 652 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action for injuries sustained by a pedestrian struck by an automobile, trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that, when necessary, a driver must give warning to a pedestrian by sounding the horn in which action the evidence did not establish that the driver saw or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have seen the pedestrian in time to effectually sound a warning. Pridgen v. Lewallen, 95 Idaho 213, 506 P.2d 110 (1973).

       <p>
        The question as to whether or not driver of an automobile had the last clear chance of avoiding the accident when his car struck the pedestrian crossing the road, in view of the facts, was one for the jury, and the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of the driver. Jack v. Fillmore, 85 Idaho 36, 375 P.2d 321 (1962).

    No reasonable person who had been unequivocally told that he could go, as defendant was, would believe that he should disregard the officer’s statement merely because the patrol car’s overhead lights were still flashing, when neither this section nor<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c14s49-1401" target="_self">§ 49-1401</a></cite>(1) required defendant to remain at the site of the traffic stop after the officer authorized him to leave, and it was not practical nor necessary that an officer turn off his emergency lights before he could effectively instruct an individual who had been stopped that he could leave. State v. Roark, 140 Idaho 868, 103 P.3d 481 (Ct. App. 2004). De Facto Detention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Police officer’s act of turning on his vehicle’s emergency lights, although not necessarily intended to create a detention, did constitute a technical, de facto detention commanding defendant to remain stopped, pursuant to this section. State v. Mireles, 133 Idaho 690, 991 P.2d 878 (Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Police officers’ actions, stopping near defendant’s parked car and turning on the police vehicles’ overhead lights, were a show of authority that would convey to a reasonable person that the officers were ordering him to restrict his movement, creating a de facto seizure when defendant submitted to their authority.

        While not ruling as to whether activation of the patrol car’s emergency lights was a show of authority that effectuated a seizure, but instead assuming that activation of the lights effectuated a seizure by conveying to defendant that she was not free to leave, such a seizure was reasonable and constitutionally permissible in view of the surrounding circumstances.

Accordingly, where defendant, upon approach of police car which displayed flashing lights but did not sound siren, turned left in front of police car causing collision rather than pulling to right-hand side of road or stopping, conviction under statute, which requires that drivers yield for either an audible or visual signal, was upheld even though the Boise City Code requires both an audible and visual signal.

        The driver of a pickup truck which was being followed by a truck and trailer violated three former statutory provisions in that (1) he did not approach the intersection for a left turn in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line thereof; (2) he turned his vehicle to the left upon the highway when such movement could not be made with reasonable safety; and (3) he gave no signal of his intention to turn when the truck behind him would be affected by such movement, and such acts and omissions on his part constituted negligence. Woodman v. Knight, 85 Idaho 453, 380 P.2d 222 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The last portion of the former statute which stated “except . . . when preparing for a left turn . . . into a private road or driveway,” allowed the driver to move from the right hand lane to the left hand lane preparatory to making a left turn off the highway.

       <p>
        Even though there was no audible signal given by truck driver signaling his intention to pass, the act of the pickup truck driver in moving to the right shoulder of the highway might have been legitimately considered as an invitation to pass, however such act of the truck driver in attempting to pass the pickup truck when within 100 feet of, or traversing, the intersection and in failing to sound his horn, was concurrent with negligence of pickup driver in failing to properly maneuver for a left-hand turn and the negligence of each was a contributing proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries sustained when plaintiff’s car was hit by truck, for in the absence of the negligence of either, the collision would not have occurred. Under the circumstances, while they were not acting in concert but independently, each became jointly and severally liable for plaintiff’s injuries. Woodman v.

        In an action for damages growing out of a two-car collision in which all occupants of both cars were killed and there were no other eyewitnesses, evidence from physical facts after the collision showing that one driver was slightly on the wrong side of the road after the collision was insufficient to establish negligence per se and such evidence that the other driver was on the wrong side before the collision was sufficient to establish ordinary negligence per se, but not gross negligence.

        Where defendants’ theory of the case was that defendants had not crossed center line of road, no instruction concerning justification of a violation of a statute by defendants was required to be given by the court, since according to defendants’ theory there was no violation of any statute by defendants.

        The motor vehicle laws anticipate that ordinarily cars meeting on the highway should pass each other to the right; however, in a reasonable attempt to avoid an impending collision, one may turn to the left beyond the center line without necessarily offending against the law of negligence, even though he fails to avoid the collision.

       <p>
        Even though there was no audible signal given by truck driver signaling his intention to pass, the act of the pickup truck driver in moving to the right shoulder of the highway might have been legitimately considered as an invitation to pass, however such act of the truck driver in attempting to pass the pickup truck when within 100 feet of, or traversing, the intersection and in failing to sound his horn, was concurrent with negligence of pickup driver in failing to properly maneuver for a left-hand turn and the negligence of each was a contributing proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries sustained when plaintiff’s car was hit by truck, for in the absence of the negligence of either, the collision would not have occurred. Under the circumstances, while they were not acting in concert but independently, each became jointly and severally liable for plaintiff’s injuries. Woodman v. Knight, 85 Idaho 453, 380 P.2d 222 (1963).

        Instructions that essentially tracked the language of this section, regarding when passing on the right is permitted but which omitted the last line of subsection (2) that “the movement shall not be made by driving off the roadway,” was not defective since the addition of the last line would confuse the jury, and there was not an issue before the jury of passing on the right beyond the surface of the roadway.

        Court erred in finding that personal injury plaintiff was negligent per se for passing on the right side of the road where the term “roadway” was unclear, and it, therefore, erroneously apportioned 50 percent of the negligence to him.

        Where a truck driver failed to give any notice of his intention to make a left turn but the automobile driver attempted to pass the truck within 100 feet of an intersection, both these acts contributed proximately to the accident complained of, and the automobile driver’s recovery was barred by his contributory negligence. Bale v. Perryman, 85 Idaho 435, 380 P.2d 501 (1963).
    Even though the act of the pickup truck driver in moving to the right shoulder of the highway might have been legitimately considered as an invitation to pass, the act of the truck driver in attempting to pass the pickup truck when within 100 feet of, or traversing, the intersection and in failing to sound his horn was concurrent with negligence of pickup driver in failing to properly maneuver for a left hand turn.

        A driver would not be guilty of negligence per se under former law that prohibited driving to the left of center of roadway, when approaching a curve or within 100 feet of an intersection, when he attempts to overtake another driver and collides with him, when the other driver attempts to turn onto an obscure private road.

        Defendant’s act of driving onto, but not across, the line marking the right edge of the road, or the fog line, did not violate this section. State v. Neal, 159 Idaho 439, 362 P.3d 514 (2015).
    It was not error to suppress defendant’s traffic stop based on crossing a fog line, because the stop was unconstitutional. A fog line is not a lane barrier. The fog line’s purpose is not to create a lane boundary, but to inform a driver of the road’s edge, so that under certain conditions the driver can safely maintain his position on the roadway. Crossing a fog line does not create a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the statute was violated. State v. Fuller, 163 Idaho 585, 416 P.3d 957 (2018).

A driver is expected to use reasonable common sense when assessing the road conditions and adjusting his or her driving patterns accordingly. State v. Harper, 163 Idaho 539, 415 P.3d 948 (Ct.

        Defendant’s claim of an obstructed view did not provide him with an absolute defense to an infraction charge under this section, because, if his view was obstructed, he should have slowed to an appropriate speed, or even come to a stop if necessary, so that he could sufficiently regard any approaching vehicles.

        Failure of local authorities to install traffic control devices at a “T” intersection where a street terminates at its junction with a main arterial thoroughfare does not interfere with or frustrate the legislature’s intent regarding the regulation of traffic. The failure to install control devices simply triggers the application of this section, expressing the legislature’s intent concerning progression of motor vehicles at intersections unregulated by traffic control signs or devices.

        Two vehicles are to be considered as entering an intersection at approximately the same time when they approach so nearly at the same time that there would be imminent hazard of a collision if both continued the same course at the same speed. Coughran v. Hickox, 82 Idaho 18, 348 P.2d 724 (1960). Excessive Speed.

       </p>
       <p>
        If defendant was observing traffic rules and the intersection collision was proximately caused by plaintiff’s excessive and dangerous rate of speed, plaintiff could not rely on right of way to recover against defendant. Coughran v. Hickox, 82 Idaho 18, 348 P.2d 724 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        With evidence that plaintiff entered an uncontrolled intersection at 25 miles per hour and was struck by defendant in the middle of the intersection and that defendant approached the intersection at 45 to 50 miles per hour, seeing plaintiff’s car entering the intersection when 60 feet from intersection, and applied his brakes, leaving skid marks of 42 ½ feet, it was error for the trial court to set aside a verdict for plaintiff and enter judgment for defendant non obstante. Loosli v. Bollinger, 90 Idaho 464, 413 P.2d 684 (1966), overruled on other grounds, Mann v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 95 Idaho 732, 518 P.2d 1194 (1974).

        Giving instruction to jury which consisted of the former section which governed vehicles approaching or entering an intersection was proper in explaining the statutory duty of drivers approaching an intersection. Moreover, trial court’s failure to amplify such instruction by instruction defining the various terms used in the statute was not error in the absence of a request for such instruction. Mendenhall v. MacGregor Triangle Co., 83 Idaho 145, 358 P.2d 860 (1961).

        It was not error for the court to refuse an instruction embodying the provisions of the former section governing the right of way at intersections of different highways in an action involving a collision at the intersection of a through highway and a local street. Sanders v. Hamilton, 91 Idaho 225, 419 P.2d 667 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        An instruction which contained, verbatim, the provision of former law that provided right-of-way rules for vehicles entering an intersection was not error. Holland v. Peterson, 95 Idaho 728, 518 P.2d 1190 (1974).

        In an action for damages in a head-on collision between an automobile and a truck at a Y intersection, whether the automobile was on its right-hand side of the highway at the moment of the accident and the motorist’s speed were jury questions. The rule is, that where minds of reasonable men might differ, or where different conclusions might be reached, the existence of negligence or contributory negligence are generally for the jury.

        A vehicle more than 690 feet distant from and moving toward the point where a defendant entered the highway was not “approaching” within the meaning of the former section governing the right of way for vehicles approaching on the highway. Reed v. Green, 90 Idaho 526, 414 P.2d 445 (1966). Instructions.
       </p>
       <p>
        An instruction given by court stating that “the driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a highway from a private road or driveway shall yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on said highway” set out fully the duty of the defendant in the operation of her automobile as it was approaching the intersection of the street and private driveway at the same time plaintiff was approaching from the driveway in suit involving injury sustained by minor plaintiff as he rode his motor scooter from the private driveway into the street and was struck by defendant’s car. Gayhart v. Schwabe, 80 Idaho 354, 330 P.2d 327 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed the driveway out of which the defendant was alleged to have emerged upon the highway was lined with trees, such trees would not excuse defendant’s alleged violation of the former section requiring drivers entering a highway to yield the right of way, and, there being no other possible excuse shown, it was error for the court to instruct the jury that the presumption of negligence arising from violation of the statute might be overcome by showing circumstances making compliance impossible. Werth v. Tromberg, 90 Idaho 204, 409 P.2d 421 (1965).

        The driver of a pickup truck which was being followed by a truck and trailer violated three former statutory provisions in that (1) he did not approach the intersection for a left turn in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line thereof; (2) he turned his vehicle to the left upon the highway when such movement could not be made with reasonable safety; and (3) he gave no signal of his intention to turn when the truck behind him would be affected by such movement, and such acts and omissions on his part constituted negligence. Woodman v. Knight, 85 Idaho 453, 380 P.2d 222 (1963).
    Where host driver proceeding north on four-lane highway, with divider strip, made a U-turn and crossed over southbound inside lane and entered outside lane, where her vehicle was struck from rear, she was guilty of negligence under former law providing rule for proper position and method of turning at intersections, in not entering inside lane, and where her left turn indicator indicated that she intended to enter inside lane, it was within the province of the jury to determine whether or not the facts constituted gross negligence. Loving v. Freeman, 93 Idaho 426, 462 P.2d 519 (1969).

        Where collision occurred at night with the weather misty and cloudy, and railroad crossing on driver’s side of the highway had no warning sign, and where evidence showed that at night an approaching train was not “clearly visible” it could not be said that driver of motor vehicle was guilty of contributory negligence in train-automobile collision.

        An automobile passenger, who had knowledge of approaching railroad crossing, location of which passenger knew, was contributorily negligent in allowing motorist who also had knowledge of approaching crossing, to drive into train passing over the crossing on an extremely foggy night.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where last 50 feet of approach to the grade crossing was unobstructed so that passenger was bound to have seen the train approaching and being thus charged with knowledge of the approaching train, in absence of an emergency, it was his duty to warn the driver or take other appropriate action to avoid injury, and his failure to do so constituted contributory negligence. Yearout v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R.R., 82 Idaho 466, 354 P.2d 759 (1960).

        This case which involved a train occupying a crossing which was not plainly visible, which train was run into by a woman driving an automobile at night, and which crossing had a yellow flashing light overhead, presented a question for the jury of the woman driver’s contributory negligence.

        Stopping at Crossing.

       <p>
        In suit to recover for injuries sustained when driver ran into train occupying a crossing at night, the jury inferentially found that the crossing was an extra hazardous one, imposing extra duties upon the railroad company, where it found in favor of the driver under an instruction asking for a determination as to whether the railroad company should have anticipated that a motorist exercising due care and with standard lights would likely be injured by running into the side of the train. Van v. Union P.R.R., 83 Idaho 539, 366 P.2d 837 (1961). Stopping at Crossing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The stopping, required by the former statute, of a motorist approaching a railway crossing, after giving of clearly visible and positive signal warning of train’s approach, must be effective for traveler’s safety and is governed by requirements as to looking and listening, and it is the duty of a traveler, who knows or should know of apparent or further danger after starting onto the crossing, to stop, look and listen again, if he may with safety.

       <p>
        The 1997 amendment, by ch. 155, § 6, in subdivision (2)(a) substituted “business or” for “neighborhood of any” preceding “urban district”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1997 amendment, by ch. 377, § 1, in subdivision (2)(d) substituted “on state highways” for “in other locations” and created subdivision (2)(e) by transferring “in other locations” to subdivision (2)(e) from subdivision (d) and adding “fifty-five (55) miles per hour” and “unless otherwise posted up to a maximum of sixty-five (65) miles per hour”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2012 amendment, by ch. 325, rewrote paragraph (2)(a), which formerly read, “Thirty-five (35) miles per hour or a lesser maximum speed adopted pursuant to section 49-207(2)(a), Idaho Code, in any residential, business or urban district,” deleted former (2)(b) which read, “Thirty-five (35) miles per hour in any urban district,” and redesignated the subsequent paragraphs accordingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2014 amendment, by ch. 126, in subsection (2), rewrote paragraph (b), which formerly read: “Seventy-five (75) miles per hour on interstate highways”, rewrote paragraph (b), which formerly read: “Sixty-five (65) miles per hour on state highways,” and substituted “seventy (70) miles per hour” for “sixty-five (65) miles per hour” in paragraph (d); in subsection (3), deleted “The maximum lawful speed limit on interstate highways shall not exceed sixty five (65) miles per hour” at the beginning and added “the maximum lawful speed limit on interstate highways shall not exceed ten (10) miles per hour less than for vehicles with less than five (5) axles and operating at a gross weight of twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds or less, and in urban areas the maximum lawful speed limit on interstate highways for such vehicles shall not exceed sixty-five (65) miles per hour.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 24, in subsection (2), inserted “unless otherwise posted in accordance with section 49-201(4), Idaho Code, and” near the beginning of paragraphs (b) and (c).
    The 2017 amendment, by ch. 83, designated the existing provisions in subsection (2) as paragraph (2)(e), redesignating the subparagraphs therein, and added present paragraph (2)(b).

        Instruction based on subsection (2) of this section prejudiced plaintiff’s rights and was grounds for granting a new trial; instruction made it negligence per se for plaintiff to be driving in excess of thirty five miles per hour when the accident happened even though the speed limit should have been forty five miles per hour based on brooming by contractor.

        A plaintiff in a civil action is not relieved from proving proximate cause even though the negligence found is a result of the violation of the maximum speed limits set out in this section. Griffith v. Schmidt, 110 Idaho 235, 715 P.2d 905 (1985).

        On the basis of decided cases in other jurisdictions, and in the absence of a relevant statute, the Idaho court of appeals accepted the general reliability of radar traffic devices. State v. Kane, 122 Idaho 623, 836 P.2d 569 (Ct. App. 1992).
    The question of the accuracy of the radar unit in a speeding case was addressed by the officer’s testimony that he was qualified to operate the machine, that the unit was properly maintained and that it was used correctly. It is necessary that these questions be proved in each speeding prosecution and they were proven; therefore, the magistrate did not err in admitting the radar results as evidence that defendant was traveling at an excessive rate of speed. State v. Kane, 122 Idaho 623, 836 P.2d 569 (Ct. App. 1992).

        In action for damages due to collision between car and motorcycle where jury could find that seven-year-old plaintiff motorcycle rider was a special hazard under this section and that defendant could have exercised proper precaution, there was no basis to find that defendant owed no duty to plaintiff and that defendant’s conduct, as a matter of law, could not be the proximate cause of the accident; and, thus, court erred in issuing order for summary judgment.

        Where the 16-year-old defendant driver acknowledged that he had been driving too fast for conditions on the wet bridge surface, that he was not thinking but “just reacting” after his car “fishtailed” as he passed other traffic, that he was approximately 60 feet behind plaintiff’s vehicle when he stopped “fishtailing” and applied the brakes, but that when he realized the car was not slowing sufficiently, he panicked and instead of pumping the brakes, he just hit them real hard, the evidence established, as a matter of law, that the defendant had violated this section’s “basic rule” concerning a reasonable and prudent speed for the conditions present. Johnson v. Emerson, 103 Idaho 350, 647 P.2d 806 (Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        State trooper’s testimony concerning his visual estimate of the speed of defendant’s vehicle, standing alone, was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant’s vehicle was traveling above the speed limit, where the evidence was void of any information at all on the trooper’s accuracy rate and the state produced no evidence of the distance between the officer’s location and defendant’s vehicle when the officer made his estimation, the angle of the officer’s view, or how long he observed the vehicle before reaching his conclusion.

        This section is a safety statute, enacted for the protection of motorists and other persons using this state’s roads and highways, and, where an injury occurs as a proximate result of a violation of this section, the violation constitutes negligence per se unless excused or justified.

        The maximum speed contained in this section is a safety statute and the violation of this positive inhibition is negligence per se. Griffith v. Schmidt, 110 Idaho 235, 715 P.2d 905 (1985).

        Hearing officer’s finding that the arresting officer had legal cause for the traffic stop was not in error having determined that: (1) by statute, it was within the city’s authority to lower the speed limit along that portion of the highway; (2) the posted speed limit was 35 mph; (3) the driver admitted to driving 45 mph in that area of the highway; and (4) there was no other evidence in the record establishing that the city acted contrary to its statutory authority.

        Defendant’s conviction for exceeding the speed limit was appropriate where the state presented testimony that defendant’s vehicle was witnessed by the spotting officer as traveling at 76 miles per hour in a zone where the maximum speed limit was 55 miles per hour. The state also presented testimony that the chase officer was directed specifically to defendant’s vehicle by the spotting officer and that the chase officer identified defendant as the man he stopped and cited.

        Even if the jury determined that driver maintained proper look-out and actually saw the truck, from the facts they still reasonably could have found that driver failed to act as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances in attempting to race the truck through the intersection and under either interpretation, which was for the determination of the jury, contributory negligence could have been found.

        Assignment of error in giving instruction in automobile collision case as to prima facie speed limits was without merit where it was shown that there was no issue as to speed limits, the posted speed at the scene of the accident being 35 miles per hour inasmuch as the evidence showed appellant was not violating speed limit at the time of the accident. Morford v. Brown, 85 Idaho 480, 381 P.2d 45 (1963).

        Instruction, that if wrecker driver was exercising ordinary care he had a right to assume that every other person using the highway would be driving at a reasonable and prudent speed and so controlled as to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering highway, improperly stated the law. Hawkins v. Chandler, 88 Idaho 20, 396 P.2d 123 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the road was hilly and the truck driven by appellant difficult to stop when not pulling a trailer because of danger of its skidding and wheels locking when sudden brake pressure was applied, such conditions were “special hazards,” justifying the court in instructing the jury as to the former subsection which governed speed limits when special hazards were present. Werth v. Tromberg, 90 Idaho 204, 409 P.2d 421 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where the plaintiff was driving his car on a state highway at night, it was proper to instruct the jury that speed in excess of 55 miles per hour in the nighttime was prima facie evidence that the speed was not reasonable and prudent. Stanberry v. Gem County, 90 Idaho 222, 409 P.2d 430 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        An instruction in substantially the language of the former section which required that the speed of a vehicle be reasonable under the conditions then existing was not erroneous where there was evidence that defendant had not stopped at a stop sign and that his speed in rounding a curve was excessive having regard to the actual and potential hazards and surrounding circumstances then existing. Nichols v. Sonneman, 91 Idaho 199, 418 P.2d 562 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a damage action growing out of an automobile collision on a highway with heavy traffic and only two lanes open to traffic, it was proper to incorporate a portion of former law that provided that a vehicle should not be driven at a speed greater than was reasonable for existing conditions and hazards and that speed should be so controlled so as to avoid colliding with other persons or vehicles on the highway in compliance with the legal requirements and duty of all persons to use due care in a jury instruction, but provision of former law that provided that the driver of a vehicle should drive at an appropriate reduced speed approaching and crossing an intersection or railroad grade crossing, when approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding road and when special hazards exist with respect to pedestrians and other traffic or by reason of weather conditions, should not have been included where the evidence showed no grade crossing, intersection, hillcrest, or narrow or winding roadway. Fawcett v. Irby, 92 Idaho 48, 436 P.2d 714 (1968), overruled on other grounds, Salinas v. Vierstra 107 Idaho 984, 695 P.2d 369 (1985).
    In a damage case, growing out of an intersection collision, where the view of both drivers as they approached the intersection was obstructed until they reached the immediate vicinity of the obstruction, it was error to refuse plaintiff’s request for an instruction on the duty of defendant to reduce speed when his view was so obstructed even though the court gave to the jury an instruction defining in general terms the duty of motorists under former law that provided that a driver should drive at a reduced rate of speed when special hazards exist with respect to other traffic. Kidd v. Gardner Associated, Inc., 92 Idaho 548, 447 P.2d 414 (1968).

       <p>
        In an action for damages in a head-on collision between an automobile and a truck at a Y intersection, whether the automobile was on its right-hand side of the highway at the moment of the accident and the motorist’s speed were jury questions, since the rule is, that where minds of reasonable men might differ, or where different conclusions might be reached by different minds, the questions as to negligence and contributory negligence are generally for the jury. Stallinger v. Johnson, 65 Idaho 101, 139 P.2d 460 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether or not plaintiff’s truck driver was following too closely, or traveling too fast, was a jury question, the truck having tipped over in an attempt to avoid collision with the preceding car which had signaled for a left turn, started to execute it and then returned to the right hand side of the road in front of truck driver.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that the defendant in an action for damages from an automobile collision was driving at approximately fifty miles per hour without evidence of the speed limit on the road at that point and without evidence that such speed under the circumstances was imprudent was not evidence of negligence on the part of defendant. Dreyer v. Zero Refrigeration Lines, 92 Idaho 83, 437 P.2d 355 (1968).

        Charge of contributory negligence was not justified where plaintiff entered intersection at a speed slightly in excess of 15 miles an hour though view was partially obstructed and was hit by a car driven by defendant proceeding at a rate of 40 miles per hour. Bell v. Carlson, 75 Idaho 193, 270 P.2d 420 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        If defendant was observing traffic rules and the intersection collision was proximately caused by plaintiff’s excessive and dangerous rate of speed, plaintiff could not rely on the former right of way statute to recover against defendant. Coughran v. Hickox, 82 Idaho 18, 348 P.2d 724 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant’s view of intersecting highway on his right was obstructed, it was his duty to drive at such an appropriate reduced speed that he could slow down or stop as need be when he reached a point where he could see a vehicle approaching from his right in such proximity as to give rise to the hazard of a collision should he proceed. Coughran v. Hickox, 82 Idaho 18, 348 P.2d 724 (1960).
    Where the evidence showed that plaintiff entered an uncontrolled intersection at 25 miles per hour and was struck by defendant in the middle of the intersection and that defendant approached the intersection at 45 to 50 miles per hour, seeing plaintiff’s car entering the intersection when 60 feet from the intersection, it was error for the trial court to set aside a verdict for plaintiff and enter judgment for defendant non obstante. Loosli v. Bollinger, 90 Idaho 464, 413 P.2d 684 (1966).

       <p>
        In an action for injuries and property loss sustained when a lumber truck struck a runaway snowmobile which the plaintiff dealer had pursued onto the highway, the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury finding that the plaintiff had reasonable cause to believe others would be imperiled if he did not pursue the snowmobile onto the highway in an effort to stop it, and that faced with this emergency, he acted reasonably in pursuing the snowmobile without first taking time to ascertain if it was safe for him to do so, as required by former section under ordinary circumstances.

       </p>
       <p>
        A pedestrian who walked across the street in the middle of the block where there was neither a pedestrian crossing nor a safety walk, in violation of a city ordinance, was guilty of negligence per se and could not recover damages since such negligence was a contributory cause of the accident.

        Where, in personal injury action, the plaintiff testified that he regularly jogged in the roadway and he was struck by the car on the roadway, it was not error for the court to refuse to give an instruction reciting this section.

        The refusal to give certain instructions under the circumstances presented was not error where court’s instructions adequately covered the requested instructions, such requested instructions involving speed of an automobile under certain circumstances, rights and duties of pedestrians, and the place of walking for pedestrians. Lallatin v. Terry, 81 Idaho 238, 340 P.2d 112 (1959). Negligence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a pedestrian, who was pushing a two-wheel cart in nighttime along right side of street bordered by a cinder footpath customarily used by pedestrians, was struck from the rear by a taxicab, his negligence, if any, in using the path or in failing to step aside to avoid the collision was a question for the jury. Franklin v. Wooters, 55 Idaho 619, 45 P.2d 804 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court properly denied motions for nonsuit, directed verdict, and judgment non obstante veredicto based on the theory that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in walking on and along the right-hand side of the highway, where there was a conflict of evidence as to whether plaintiff, when struck, was walking along the highway or in a tavern parking lot adjacent thereto. Loomis v. Hannah, 89 Idaho 358, 404 P.2d 568 (1965).

        In suit for personal injuries as a result of auto accident, where district court thoroughly covered the duties of a driver at a stop sign and the law concerning right-of-way at intersections in instructions to the jury, which provided the applicable law at the time of the occurrence in question, it did not err in refusing to give instruction to show that a person driving on a through street has a statutory right not to have to anticipate that a driver at a stop sign will fail to yield.

        DUI defendant, who crossed over a stop line to see around a fence which was obstructing his view of oncoming traffic, was not in violation of Idaho stop sign statute, because the statute allowed motorists various options for compliance in coming to a stop at an intersection. However, he was in violation of a local municipal ordinance, which was not in conflict with the state code, and this gave a police officer probable cause to make a traffic stop. State v. Young, 144 Idaho 646, 167 P.3d 783 (Ct. App. 2006).

        Where defendant had stopped at a stop sign, then ran into plaintiff, who had been safely proceeding on a through street, plaintiff had a right to assume defendant would obey the law and remain stopped until it was safe to proceed, and since she had that right, there was no evidence plaintiff was negligent in any respect.

       The director shall adopt standards and specifications applicable to head lamps, clearance lamps, identification and other lamps on snow removal equipment when operated on the highways in lieu of the lamps otherwise required on vehicles by this title. Standards and specifications may permit the use of flashing lights for purposes of identification on snow removal equipment when in service upon the highways.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c09s49-901ol12">
       The director may adopt standards and specifications applicable to lighting equipment on and special warning devices to be carried by school buses supplemental to but consistent with the provisions of section 49-914 [49-915], Idaho Code. Standards and specifications shall correlate with and so far as possible conform to specifications then current as approved by the society of automotive engineers.

       The director is authorized to approve or disapprove lighting devices and to issue and enforce rules establishing standards and specifications for the approval of lighting devices, their installation, adjustment, and aiming, and adjustment when in use on motor vehicles. Regulations shall correlate with and, so far as practicable, conform to the then current standards and specifications of the society of automotive engineers applicable to that equipment.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c09s49-901ol14">
       The director shall approve or disapprove any lighting device, of a type on which approval is specifically required in this title, within a reasonable time after the device has been submitted. He is authorized to set up the procedure which shall be followed when any device is submitted for approval, and upon approving any lamp or device shall issue to the applicant a certificate of approval together with any instructions determined by him. The department shall publish lists of all lamps and devices by name and type which have been approved. Any person desiring approval of a device shall notify the director in writing of the person’s intention and shall submit the device for testing and approval as directed by the director. The director shall not approve a lighting device on any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle that does not have a self-recovery lighting system such as a generator or alternator to replace the power supply.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c09s49-901ol15">
       The director shall approve and disapprove warning lighting devices on emergency and police vehicles and establish standards and specifications for emergency warning lighting devices.

       When the department has reason to believe that an approved device as being sold commercially does not comply with the requirements of this title, the director may, after giving thirty (30) days’ previous notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for the device in this state, conduct a hearing upon the question of compliance of the approved device. After the hearing he shall determine whether the approved device meets the requirements of this title. If the device does not meet the requirements of this title, he shall give notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for the device in this state.
      </li>

     <p>
      If at the expiration of ninety (90) days after the notice, the person holding the certificate of approval for the device has failed to satisfy the department that the approved device as thereafter to be sold meets the requirements of this title, the director shall suspend or revoke the approval issued until or unless the device is resubmitted to and retested by an approved testing agency and found to meet the requirements of this title, and may require that all the devices sold since the notification following the hearing be replaced with devices that do comply with the requirements of this title. The department may at the time of the retest, purchase in the open market and submit to the testing agency one or more sets of the approved devices, and if the device upon retest fails to meet the requirements of this title, the director may refuse to renew the certificate of approval of the device.
    (7) The director shall adopt and enforce safety requirements, rules and specifications applicable to air conditioning equipment which shall correlate with and, so far as possible, conform to the current recommended practice or standard applicable to air conditioning equipment approved by the society of automotive engineers.

      (8) The director in cooperation with the state board of education shall adopt and enforce rules not inconsistent with this title to govern the design and operation of all school buses when owned and operated by any school district or privately owned and operated under contract with any school district in the state, and these rules shall by reference be made a part of any contract with a school district. Every school district, its officers and employees, and every person employed under contract by a school district shall be subject to these rules.

        Statutes which require that safety devices be carried in every vehicle from sunset to sunrise, and which impose certain safety requirements on operators with a disabled vehicle, clearly applied only to one who was either an operator or driver of the vehicle at issue, and as none of these safety statutes mention dealers, there was no statutory duty imposed upon a licensed commercial dealer of used motor vehicles to inspect for, equip vehicles with or warn buyers of, the absence of statutorily required safety devices.

        Instruction by district court that failure of a person to have his vehicle equipped with statutory lights was only evidence of negligence was incorrect, as such failure is prima facie evidence of negligence. However, since it was admitted that there was a failure to have the required lights, the error was not prejudicial. Turner v. Purdum, 77 Idaho 130, 289 P.2d 608 (1955), overruled on other grounds, Schaub v. Linehan, 92 Idaho 332, 442 P.2d 742 (1968). Operable Headlights.

        Operable headlights may be unexpectedly required long before sunset due to sudden changes of weather, agricultural dust, or smoke from burning fields; therefore, defendant’s reading of this section as permitting the operation of vehicles with inoperable headlights before sunset was inconsistent with Idaho’s policy of providing a safe highway system.

        In action for damages, it is for jury to determine whether absence of taillight from vehicle constitutes negligence. Tendoy v. West, 51 Idaho 679, 9 P.2d 1026 (1932).

        Pushcart was not a “vehicle” within statutes requiring all vehicles to carry rear light in nighttime, and whether owner of pushcart, who was stuck from rear by taxicab in nighttime, was contributorily negligent in not having light on rear of the cart is for the jury.

        In an action for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff in automobile accident, the instructions stating correct law insofar as the lights required to be placed upon defendant’s vehicle and then advising the jury that nevertheless it could find the defendants negligent in failing to provide additional warnings above and beyond those required by the statute, using a reasonable prudent man test, covered the contentions of plaintiffs and the applicable law when read together.

        It was for the jury to determine whether visibility of plaintiff’s car was such as to relieve him of the statutory duty of lighting a lamp; therefore, instruction as to display of a lamp on a vehicle parked or stopped upon a roadway or shoulder adjacent thereto, reiterating provisions of statute as to sufficient light to reveal an object within a distance of 500 feet, was not erroneous under theory plaintiff’s car was visible for that distance.

        Statutes which require that safety devices be carried in every vehicle from sunset to sunrise and which impose certain safety requirements on operators with a disabled vehicle clearly applied only to one who was either an operator or driver of the vehicle at issue, and as none of these safety statutes mention dealers. There was no statutory duty imposed upon a licensed commercial dealer of used motor vehicles to inspect for, equip vehicles with or to warn buyers of the absence of statutorily required safety devices. Mugavero v. A-1 Auto Sales, Inc., 130 Idaho 554, 944 P.2d 151 (Ct. App. 1997).

        A motorist overtaking and passing a bicyclist was under duty to give an audible warning when reasonably necessary. Kelley v. Bruch, 91 Idaho 50, 415 P.2d 693 (1966).
    This section lays down no blanket mandatory requirement of sounding an audible warning when passing, nor can such a requirement be read into former<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c07s49-710" target="_self">§ 49-710</a></cite>(b) (now<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c06s49-627" target="_self">§ 49-627</a></cite>).

        Even though the act of the pickup truck driver in moving to the right shoulder of the highway might have been legitimately considered as an invitation to pass, the act of the truck driver attempting to pass the pickup truck and in failing to sound his horn was concurrent with negligence of pickup driver in failing to properly maneuver for a left hand turn and the negligence of each was a contributing proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries sustained when plaintiff’s car was hit by truck.

       The weight allowances provided in this subsection do not apply if the total gross weight of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is intended to exceed seventy-nine thousand (79,000) pounds as declared by the operator. When the provisions of this subsection are applicable to a vehicle or combination of vehicles, it shall be a violation of the provisions of this subsection if that vehicle or combination of vehicles exceeds the weights specified in this table.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) In determining the gross weight of a vehicle or the gross weight of any two (2) or more consecutive axles under subsection (1) or (2) or (9) of this section, the total gross weight of the vehicle or combination of vehicles or the gross weight of any two (2) or more consecutive axles shall be the sum of the axle weights.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purposes of this chapter the gross weight of a vehicle or the gross weight of any two (2) or more consecutive axles may be determined by accumulatively adding the separate weights of individual axles and tandem axles or groups of axles to determine gross weight. The results of any weighing at a temporary or permanent port of entry and the records relating to the calibration and accuracy of any scale at a temporary or permanent port of entry shall be admissible in any proceeding in this state. In order to prove a violation of the provisions of this section the state must show that:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) The sum of the axle weights exceeds what is allowable under the provisions of subsection (1) or (2) or (9) of this section;
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) The scale involved in the weighing was at the time of weighing calibrated in conformity with and met the accuracy requirements of the standards for the enforcement of traffic and highway laws as set forth in the latest edition of handbook 44 of the national institute of standards and technology;
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) Weights of individual axles or axles within a commonly suspended group of axles supported by a mechanical system designed to distribute equal wheel loads to individual axles in the group were utilized only to determine gross weights of that group of axles, and that any further evaluation of gross weights of combinations of axles considered only the accumulated gross weight of each such commonly suspended group of axles.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) In applying the weight limitations imposed in this section, a vehicle or combination of vehicles must comply exclusively with the weight limitations in either subsection (1) or (2) or (9) of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       (5) In applying the weight limitations imposed in this section, the distance between axles shall be measured to the nearest even foot. When a fraction is exactly one-half (½) foot the next larger whole number shall be used.
      </p>
      <p>
       (6) The limitations imposed in this section are in addition and supplemental to all other laws imposing limitations upon the size and weight of vehicles. Further, single axles within groups of axles are subject to the provisions and limitations of this chapter. Single axles within groups of axles may be weighed and evaluated separately.
      </p>
      <p>
       (7) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, no vehicle, motor vehicle, trailer and/or semitrailer, or combination thereof, may be operated on the public highways of the state under loads which would result in the withholding of funds by operation of controlling federal law as provided in the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, as amended.
      </p>
      <p>
       (8) Except as provided herein, no vehicle or combination of vehicles may proceed past the place of weighing at temporary or permanent ports of entry or checking stations when: the weight of a single axle exceeds the maximum limitations set forth herein by two thousand (2,000) pounds or more; the weight of a combination of axles, or gross vehicle weight exceeds the maximum allowable weight as set forth herein by seven percent (7%) or more. Vehicles or combinations of vehicles which exceed the weight limitations set forth herein shall be required to be brought into compliance with applicable weight limitations contained within this subsection at the place of weighing prior to continuing, except those vehicles or combinations of vehicles which are transporting loads which, in the determination of the board or other proper authorities in charge of or having jurisdiction over a highway, are deemed unsafe or impractical to bring into compliance at the place of weighing, and except those vehicles which do not exceed fifteen percent (15%) over maximum axle and axle group weights set forth in this section. Vehicles or combinations of vehicles transporting loads in this latter category shall obtain a travel authorization to the nearest place of safe unloading, load adjustment or other means of legalization.
    (a) Neither the state of Idaho or its employees, nor any authority and its employees in charge of or having jurisdiction over a highway, shall be held liable for personal injury or property damage resulting from the requirements of section 49-1001(8), Idaho Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) The fee for a travel authorization as set forth above shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) and shall be on a form prescribed by the board or other proper authorities, and shall not be construed as contributing to a reduction in the penalties prescribed in section 49-1013, Idaho Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) The board or other proper authorities in charge of or having jurisdiction over a highway shall adopt and enforce administrative rules as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

      <p>
       (9) For vehicles on all highways except the United States federal interstate and defense highways of this state, the following table shall apply:

        This section was amended by two 1998 acts — ch. 108, § 2, effective July 1, 1998 and ch. 158, § 3, effective July 1, 1998 — which do not conflict and were compiled together. However, additions to subsection designations made by the compiler were necessitated because each act added subsections which were different textually but had the same designation. These differences were resolved by § 16 of S.L. 2000, ch. 265.
    The 1998 amendment, by ch. 108, § 2, inserted the “(1)” designation at the beginning of the first paragraph, inserted the “(a),” “(b)” and “(c)” designations in the three subsequent paragraphs, added subsection (2), and inserted the “(3)” designation in the last paragraph.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1998 amendment, by ch. 158, § 3, inserted the “(1)” designation at the beginning of the first paragraph and added subsections (2) and (3). For the redesignation of these subsections by the compiler, see the first Compiler’s note above.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 258, amended this section as amended by S.L. 2007, chapter 257 and inserted subsection (4)(ii).

       <p>
        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 277, added subsection (6).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 152, removed the pilot project status from the truck routes designated in this section for increased gross weight loads.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 26, in subsection (1), substituted “shall be in either hard copy or digital format” for “shall be in writing” near the beginning of paragraph (a) and inserted “whether in hard copy or digital format” near the beginning of paragraph (c); and substituted “shall be in either hard copy or digital format” for “shall be in writing” at the end of the third sentence in subsection (5).

       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2019 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 179, in subsection (1), substituted “department or local authorities” for “board or other proper authorities” and “board or authorities” near the beginning of the introductory paragraph and near the end of paragraph (a), substituted “department or local authorities” for “board or authorities” near the middle of paragraph (a), and inserted “or local authority” near the end of paragraph (c); in subsection (4), in the introductory paragraph, substituted “board” for “department” near the beginning and substituted “local authority” for “local public highway agency” near the middle of the first sentence, substituted “local authority” for “local highway agency” near the end of the second sentence, and rewrote the last sentence, which formerly read: “State routes designated by the legislature and identified on a map entitled ‘Designated Routes’ are”, and deleted paragraphs (a) to (ii), which listed specific designated state routes; in subsection (5), rewrote the first sentence, which formerly read: “An annual administrative permit fee for operating on designated routes at the weights specified in subsection (4) of this section shall be set by the board for travel on state routes and by the local public highway agency for travel on routes under its jurisdiction, but not to exceed a maximum of fifty dollars ($ 50.00) per vehicle”, substituted “Local authorities” for “Local public highway agencies” in the second sentence, and substituted “local authority” for “local public highway agency” twice in the third sentence; and substituted “local authority” for “other appropriate authority” in the first sentence in paragraph (6)(a).
    The 2019 amendment, by ch. 180, inserted “up to 129K” near the end of the introductory paragraph in subsection (4); and rewrote the first two sentences in subsection (5), which formerly read: “An annual administrative permit fee for operating on designated routes at the weights specified in subsection (4) of this section shall be set by the board for travel on state routes and by the local public highway agency for travel on routes under its jurisdiction, but not to exceed a maximum of fifty dollars ($ 50.00) per vehicle.

        Where plaintiffs submitted evidence that wide loads, such as defendant was carrying at time of accident, are commonly flagged, that a permit would probably have required flagging, but that no flagging was present on the bulldozer at the time of the accident, such evidence was sufficient to submit the question of a permit requirement and noncompliance therewith to the jury, and to allow the jury to draw the inference that the accident might not have happened if a permit had been obtained. Plaintiffs’ evidence showed that (1) they were within the class of persons that the statute was designed to protect, (2) defendants were within the class of people upon whom the statute imposed its duty, and (3) the harm suffered was the type which the statute was designed to prevent. Accordingly, evidence that no permit was obtained was admissible on issue of negligence. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).

       <p>
        Where plaintiffs submitted evidence that wide loads, such as defendant was carrying at time of accident, are commonly flagged, that a permit would probably have required flagging, but that no flagging was present on the bulldozer at the time of the accident, such evidence was sufficient to submit the question of a permit requirement and noncompliance therewith to the jury, and to allow the jury to draw the inference that the accident might not have happened if a permit had been obtained. Plaintiffs’ evidence showed that (1) they were within the class of persons that the statute was designed to protect, (2) defendants were within the class of people upon whom the statute imposed its duty, and (3) the harm suffered was the type which the statute was designed to prevent. Accordingly, evidence that no permit was obtained was admissible on issue of negligence. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).

    Blockburger v. United States
    , 284 U.S. 299 (1932) test, and the Idaho legislature clearly authorized cumulative punishment for defendant’s two axle weight violations; a registered gross weight violation required the state to prove that defendant had exceeded the weight at which he registered his tractor-trailer, and the elements to prove defendant exceeded the allowable weight limits for his tandem drive axle and his four axle bridge did not require the state to prove the defendant’s registered weight.

        Under policy issued to husband to enable him to establish proof of financial responsibility under the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act as a condition to the registration of his automobile and the issuance to him of a driver’s license, there was no liability under such policy for the negligent operation of an automobile by him other than the one automobile covered by the policy regardless of the fact that the car he was driving at the time of killing a man was community property, placed in the name of his wife, as was the covered automobile. Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Wendler, 84 Idaho 114, 368 P.2d 933 (1962).

       <p>
        Where insurer did not undertake to provide proof of financial responsibility by the issuance of the policy in question, but rather was unaware of the prior accident of insured and his drinking habits, such liability policy was not obtained or issued under the requirements of the Idaho Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act and the terms and conditions of said policy imposed no absolute liability upon the insurer. Upon proof of insured’s knowledge that the application contained false statements material to the risk when it was signed, insurer was entitled to cancel the policy. Temperance Ins. Exch. v.

        It was permissible, under the statutory law in effect in 1987, for an insurance company to exclude from coverage, in a motor vehicle owner’s policy of liability insurance, non-owned vehicles regularly made available for use by the insured.

       <p>
        Since the purpose of the motor vehicle safety responsibility act is to protect the public against irresponsible drivers, the word “permission” in a family context situation means general permission to at least occasionally use a family vehicle and precise permission to do what the driver is doing at the moment of the accident is unnecessary. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hmelevsky, 97 Idaho 46, 539 P.2d 598 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a daughter had specific permission to drive the family automobile for a limited purpose on the day of the accident and, though specifically forbidden to allow any other person to drive the vehicle, the daughter expressly permitted a third person to operate the automobile, operation of the vehicle by the third person was with the permission of the parents and, thus, within the coverage of a motor vehicle liability policy, even though daughter had deviated from the specific use permission at the time of the accident. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hmelevsky, 97 Idaho 46, 539 P.2d 598 (1975).

       <p>
        District court properly determined that a vehicle’s owner gave the driver permission to drive where the owner’s instruction to the driver to drive the vehicle to a gas station and back constituted express permission to operate the vehicle. Or. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 148 Idaho 47, 218 P.3d 391 (2009). Protection of Third Persons.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability insurance protecting the owner-operator against financial loss is operative in protecting third persons regardless of what motor vehicle the damaged third person might have been occupying, or whether the third party was a pedestrian, or in any other circumstance when the third person was injured by the operation of the insured motor vehicle. Dullenty v. Rocky Mt. Fire & Cas. Co., 111 Idaho 98, 721 P.2d 198 (1986), overruled on other grounds, Colonial Penn Franklin Ins. Co. v. Welch, 119 Idaho 913, 811 P.2d 838 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The liability portion of an automobile insurance policy does not protect third persons from damage caused by an insured while driving a named motor vehicle; rather it is the tortfeasor owner-operator of the named vehicle who is protected against financial loss when and if a damaged third party makes a claim against the insured owner-operator. Dullenty v. Rocky Mt. Fire & Cas. Co., 111 Idaho 98, 721 P.2d 198 (1986), overruled on other grounds, Colonial Penn Franklin Ins. Co. v. Welch, 119 Idaho 913, 811 P.2d 838 (1991).

        The 2007 amendment of subsection (12), prohibiting insurers from providing step-down limits for household members under an insured’s primary motor vehicle policy, is not applicable to supplemental liability (umbrella) policies. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schrock, 150 Idaho 817, 252 P.3d 98 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (6), an insurer can provide supplemental coverage under an umbrella policy without subjecting itself to the statutory mandates that apply to a motor vehicle liability policy. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schrock, 150 Idaho 817, 252 P.3d 98 (2011).

      After consultation with insurance companies authorized to issue automobile liability policies in this state, the director of insurance shall approve reasonable plans for the equitable apportionment among those companies of applicants for policies and for motor vehicle liability policies who are in good faith entitled to but are unable to procure policies through ordinary methods. When a plan has been approved, all those insurance companies shall subscribe to and participate in the plan. Any applicant for a policy, any person insured under such a plan, and any insurance company affected, may appeal to the director of insurance from any ruling or decision of the manager or committee designated to operate the plan. Any person aggrieved hereunder by any order or act of the director of insurance may, within ten (10) days after notice of it, file a petition in the district court of Ada County, Idaho, for a review. The court shall summarily hear the petition and may make an appropriate order or decree.

        The Idaho Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act (IMVFRA) requires car rental agencies to carry liability insurance on the vehicles it rents, but it does not address the efficacy of other insurance clauses in cases where more than one insurance policy is at issue. Where the lessee is covered by two policies and losses due to accident are less than combined limits of both applicable policies, the losses should be allocated pro rata in proportion to the amount of insurance provided by the respective policies.

        When read in conjunction with<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c12s49-1212" target="_self">§ 49-1212</a></cite>, this section does not require coverage of damage caused to property owned by, rented to, in charge of or transported by the insured.

        The magistrate did not abuse his discretion in requiring the defendant to serve two days incarceration for operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance, where the defendant knew of his licensing status for at least three months prior to the accident, knew the insurance was cancelled because of his licensing status, and knowingly failed to correct the problem until six weeks after the accident.

       <p>
        A police officer’s request to see a certificate of liability insurance is not a “search” governed by the Fourth Amendment. The insurance certificate, like a driver’s license or a certificate of motor vehicle registration, is statutorily mandated evidence of compliance with state-imposed conditions for operating a motor vehicle upon the public highways, and no legitimate privacy interest inheres in the documents themselves. State v. Reed, 107 Idaho 162, 686 P.2d 842 (Ct. App. 1984).

        This section does not compel incriminating testimony; it merely requires production of a nonincriminating document.

        This section, requiring proof of motor vehicle liability insurance, falls squarely within the constitutionally recognized scope of a state’s police power. State v. Reed, 107 Idaho 162, 686 P.2d 842 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Driver’s license and vehicle registration requirements constitute a legitimate exercise of the state’s police power; licensing drivers is a means of determining that vehicle operators have acquired a minimal standard of competence; requiring driver competence is a public purpose within the police power of the state, and the licensing procedure is a reasonable attempt to accomplish that purpose. The vehicle registration requirement also reasonably furthers protection of public health, safety and welfare and, as such, is a proper exercise of the state’s police power. Gordon v. State, 108 Idaho 178, 697 P.2d 1192 (Ct. App.), appeal dismissed, 474 U.S. 803, 106 S. Ct. 35, 88 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1985).

        A police officer who observed a white light on the rear of a forward-moving vehicle reasonably could have suspected a defective tail lamp and would have been entitled briefly to detain the vehicle for further inquiry. Once the stop had occurred, nothing in the Fourth Amendment would preclude the officer from routinely asking the motorist to exhibit his driver’s license, the vehicle registration, and an insurance certificate.

       <p>
        A legislative requirement that motorists carry liability insurance falls within the social and economic domain reserved for the deferential judicial standard of review; it is not only reasonably conceivable but manifest that this requirement serves the objective of reducing the economic hardship suffered by persons injured, or whose property is damaged, by financially irresponsible operators of motor vehicles. Requiring motorists to carry proof of such insurance, and to display it upon request, further secures the accomplishment of this purpose; accordingly, this section does not infringe upon substantive due process.

        The information charging accused with failure to stop his motor vehicle at the scene of an accident and to render aid and furnish information after striking and injuring two persons was defective, since it failed to charge knowledge on the part of accused which is an essential element of the offense. State v. Parish, 79 Idaho 75, 310 P.2d 1082 (1957). Knowledge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although intent is an essential element of the crime, knowledge on the part of the accused of the accident resulting in the injury to another person requiring accused involved therein to immediately stop his vehicle and return to, and remain at, the scene of the accident until he has given his name, address and registration number and rendered aid to the injured does not require a showing by the state, by direct testimony, that the accused actually knew that the motor vehicle he was driving had struck someone. All of the facts and circumstances indicative of knowledge of such an accident may be considered by the jury in its determination of the fact of knowledge. State v. Parish, 79 Idaho 75, 310 P.2d 1082 (1957).

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that defendant drove from 70 to 105 miles per hour at night on a highway 22 feet wide, through open range country where cattle were known to wander upon the highway, the pavement being rough with the edges jagged from erosion, was sufficient to convict defendant of reckless driving even though the evidence also showed that defendant kept to his proper traffic lane without swerving and was able to stop without skidding behind a truck stopped for a roadblock. State v. Pruett, 91 Idaho 537, 428 P.2d 43 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that defendant drove forty-five miles an hour in a twenty-five-mile-an-hour zone on a street thirty-five feet wide, at eleven o’clock at night, when nearby theaters customarily let out and patrons emerged to go to their cars, and “squealed” his tires in making a U-turn was sufficient to sustain a conviction for reckless driving. State v. Hanson, 92 Idaho 665, 448 P.2d 758 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jury was entitled to consider the officer’s testimony that defendant was operating his motorcycle at high speeds on the wrong side of the road while turning blind corners and cresting blind hills and the conviction for reckless driving was therefore affirmed.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where police stop a motorist who has been driving while under the influence of alcohol, it is clear that the more dangerous conduct which the legislature sought to prevent has already occurred and that the motorist’s continuing control over his stopped vehicle is not an additional event, but is merely incidental to his act of driving; therefore, the state cannot circumvent the rules against double jeopardy by attempting to carve a defendant’s single course of conduct into separate “temporal events” in order to charge the defendant with both DUI and erratic driving.

       <p>
        In prosecution for driving under the influence, trial court erred in suppressing evidence obtained after police officers approached stopped vehicle which they had just observed driving without headlights and with its passenger door open and, after observing defendant curled up on the floor behind the front seats, opened door and ordered defendant to exit vehicle, because at that point, the officers possessed a reasonable suspicion to detain defendant driver for the traffic violations they had witnessed.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a manslaughter prosecution, instruction on necessity of jury finding that negligence or some other unlawful act of motorist was the proximate cause of death is not erroneous so far as affecting question on instruction on a lesser offense is concerned. State v. Monteith, 53 Idaho 30, 20 P.2d 1023 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution of motorist for manslaughter, instruction that if defendant was not guilty of manslaughter, jury might find him guilty of reckless driving was properly refused. State v. Monteith, 53 Idaho 30, 20 P.2d 1023 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court’s failure to instruct the jury as to degree of negligence which occupant of an automobile must prove to warrant recovery from driver for injuries is error, requiring reversal, where some instructions relate to gross negligence and others to ordinary negligence.

       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction was not error, which charged that driving on a highway in a motor vehicle while intoxicated was an unlawful act, and that if jury found that operation of automobile by defendant while intoxicated was the proximate cause of death of decedent, that they should find defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

        Where a defendant was charged with commission of unlawful acts while operating a motor vehicle on public highway under influence of intoxicating liquor and at a rate of speed so as to endanger persons and property which resulted in death of another human being, it constituted involuntary manslaughter so that instruction on criminal negligence was neither necessary nor proper, but giving of instruction was not prejudicial, since it was to the advantage of the defendant.

        No reasonable person who had been unequivocally told that he could go, as defendant was, would believe that he should disregard the officer’s statement merely because the patrol car’s overhead lights were still flashing, when neither<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c06s49-625" target="_self">§ 49-625 </a></cite>nor<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c14s49-1401" target="_self">§ 49-1401</a></cite>(1) required defendant to remain at the site of the traffic stop after the officer authorized him to leave, and it was not practical nor necessary that an officer turn off his emergency lights before he could effectively instruct an individual who had been stopped that he could leave.

        Police officers’ actions, stopping near defendant’s parked car and turning on the police vehicles’ overhead lights, were a show of authority that would convey to a reasonable person that the officers were ordering him to restrict his movement, creating a de facto seizure when defendant submitted to their authority.

    Defendant’s prosecution for eluding a peace officer in violation of this section, following a conviction in Washington on the same charge, stemming from a high-speed chase across both states, was not precluded by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.19.html#t19c03s19-315" target="_blank">§ 19-315</a></cite>, because the act that was the basis for the charge in Idaho was not the same act that gave rise to charges in Washington, and at no time did the two states share venue over an act which was charged as a public offense. The defendant acted in Idaho, followed by an action in Washington. State v. Madden, 147 Idaho 886, 216 P.3d 644 (Ct. App. 2009). Penalty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the legislature unambiguously denominated a violation of subsection (2) of this section, eluding a peace officer, a felony, and because it did not provide a specific prison term for that charge, the punishment set forth in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c01s18-112" target="_blank">§ 18-112</a></cite>, is applicable and the penalty set forth in subsection (3) of this section, license suspension, is in addition to that punishment; district court properly corrected its error and advised defendant that the maximum penalty for the charge of felony eluding a police officer was five years imprisonment, a $50,000 fine, and suspension of driving privileges for one to three years. State v. McCoy, 128 Idaho 362, 913 P.2d 578 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court acted within its discretion when it ordered defendant’s driver’s license suspension to commence upon release from incarceration, Subsection (3) does not mandate that a driver’s license suspension for a felony eluding offense must begin upon judgment of conviction, therefore, the time of commencement is discretionary within the district court.

        A deputy sheriff had sufficient facts within his knowledge to make an arrest where, upon being informed that the offense of drunken operating of a motor vehicle had been committed, such operator actually committed the offense in the presence of the officer. Starting the motor of a car and spinning wheels in an effort to move the car out of the borrow pit into which the driver had gone off the road was “driving” within the meaning of the statute.

        Under this section, an officer may arrest for driving under the influence, even if it was not committed in his presence. State v. Moore, 111 Idaho 854, 727 P.2d 1282 (Ct. App. 1986).

        Merely because driving without privileges is not included in the list of vehicular offenses in this section does not negate an officer’s ability to arrest, based on probable cause, for a violation of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c80s18-8001" target="_blank">§ 18-8001</a></cite>(1).

        The fact that officer had not personally and directly learned or been notified of defendant’s license suspension when he arrested defendant was not dispositive. An officer in the field may rely on information supplied by other officers, and the collective knowledge of police officers involved in the investigation — including dispatch personnel — may support a finding of probable cause.

        The provision in this section for issuance of a traffic citation was not applicable to defendant who was arrested under a city ordinance which made it a misdemeanor for a person to be intoxicated while in a private motor vehicle located in a public place and who was taken to the police station for photographing and fingerprinting.

        Defendant’s statement to officers that as an ambassador of the Kingdom of God he was not required to carry a driver’s license, and his failure to obey these officers’ previous admonitions with regard to driving without a driver’s license, did not provide a basis for arrest pursuant to this section, as the statement and continued driving constituted neither a failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of identity, nor reasonable and probable grounds to believe defendant would disregard a written promise to appear in court. Tanner v. Heise, 879 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The arrest of a driver for driving with an expired license was illegal, as no statute requires an arrest for the offense of driving with an expired license and the arrest was not required under this section, as the defendant’s license, although expired, supplied reasonable evidence of her identity. State v. Foldesi, 131 Idaho 778, 963 P.2d 1215 (Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (1) of this section allowed officers to arrest when the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the person would disregard a written promise to appear in court on misdemeanor traffic violations; thus, where pursuant to a violation defendant was stopped and had no driver’s license, no proof of insurance, the registration defendant produced was for a different vehicle, and the vehicle’s license plates were fictitious, the officer had grounds to arrest, and the search of defendant’s vehicle incident to that arrest, which revealed methamphetamine, was upheld. State v. Brown, 139 Idaho 707, 85 P.3d 683 (Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>

        Section 49-1405 and this section provide officers separate authority to arrest for a misdemeanor traffic violation, including reckless driving. State v. Jones, 151 Idaho 943, 265 P.3d 1155 (Ct. App. 2011).

        While<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c14s49-1409" target="_self">§ 49-1409 </a></cite>restricts general arresting authority for misdemeanor traffic violations, subsection (1) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c14s49-1405" target="_self">§ 49-1405 </a></cite>and this section simultaneously grant arresting authority in certain situations. Specifically, arresting authority is granted in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t49c14s49-1405" target="_self">§ 49-1405 </a></cite>in relation to seven listed offenses that the state legislature finds sufficiently serious to justify an arrest. In contrast, this section grants officers discretion to arrest when an officer has reasonable grounds to believe a person will disregard the promise to appear in court, where a person is charged with a violation relating to the refusal of a driver to submit a vehicle to an inspection or test, or where a person is charged with the failure or refusal of the driver to submit the vehicle and load to a weigh in or to remove excess weight. State v. Jones, 151 Idaho 943, 265 P.3d 1155 (Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s motion to suppress should not have been granted because, while the arrest was “lawful” as far as complying with the United States constitution, it did not comply with the Idaho constitution; the conditions that would make driving without a valid license an arrestable offense were not met, and none of the exceptions allowing arrest applied.

      (a) For purposes of determining the schedule of compensation paid to a dealer by the manufacturer or distributor, the following shall not be considered in determining amounts charged by the dealer to retail customers:
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) The dealer shall establish their schedule of compensation under the provisions of this section by submitting to the manufacturer or distributor one hundred (100) sequential customer paid service repair orders or ninety (90) days of customer paid service repair orders, whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission of such customer paid service repair orders and declaring the schedule of compensation. The new schedule of compensation shall take effect within ninety (90) days after the initial submission to the manufacturer or distributor and shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable. However, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the declared schedule of compensation from the dealer, the manufacturer or distributor may make reasonable requests for additional information supporting the declared schedule of compensation. The ninety (90) day time frame in which the manufacturer or distributor shall make the schedule of compensation effective shall commence following receipt from the dealer of any reasonably requested supporting information. No manufacturer or distributor shall require a motor vehicle dealer to establish a schedule of compensation by any other methodology or require supportive information that is unduly burdensome or time consuming to provide including, but not limited to, part by part or transaction by transaction calculations. The dealer shall not request a change in the schedule of compensation more than once every twelve (12) months.
    (12) It is unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor or subsidiary to own, operate or control, either directly or indirectly, a motor vehicle warranty or service facility located in this state except on an emergency or interim basis or if no qualified applicant has applied for appointment as a dealer in a market previously served by a motor vehicle dealer of that manufacturer or distributor’s line make except as provided for in section 49-1613(3)(g), Idaho Code.

      (13) A manufacturer [or distributor] may not otherwise recover all or any portion of its costs for compensating its dealers licensed in this state for warranty parts and labor either by reduction in the amount due to the dealer or by separate charge, surcharge or other imposition; provided however, a manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the normal course of business.
     </p>
     <p>
      (14) All procedures and protections afforded to a motor vehicle dealer under the provisions of this section shall be available to a recreational vehicle dealer. However, the schedule of compensation afforded under subsection (11) of this section shall not apply to compensation for parts, systems, fixtures, appliances, furnishings, accessories and features of a recreational vehicle that are designed, used and maintained primarily for nonvehicular residential purposes.

     <p>
      Whenever the lien upon any vehicle is lost by reason of the loss of possession through trick, fraud, or device, the repossession of the vehicle by the lien holder revives the lien, but any lien so revived is subordinate to any right, title or interest of any person under any sale, transfer, encumbrance, lien or other interest acquired or secured in good faith and for value between the time of the loss of possession and the time of repossession.

      Upon discovery of an abandoned vehicle which is not within the class of vehicles defined under “extraordinary circumstances,” an authorized officer shall attach on the vehicle, in plain view, a notice that this vehicle will be towed away at the expiration of forty-eight (48) hours as an abandoned vehicle. The notice shall contain the name of the officer who prepared the notice; the name of the agency employing the officer; the time and date of attaching the notice; the time and date after which the vehicle will be removed; the telephone number and address of the agency where further information can be obtained. A reasonable attempt shall be made to notify by telephone the owner of any vehicle which has current license plates and registration as shown on the records of the department, prior to the expiration of the forty-eight (48) hour notice period, of the location of the vehicle and the time and date of intent to remove the vehicle. The inability of an officer to notify the owner shall not preclude the removal of the vehicle at the expiration of the forty-eight (48) hour period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any vehicle which does not have current or any license plate attached may be immediately removed to a safe place of storage.

Unauthorized vehicles need not meet the provision of section 49-102(2), Idaho Code, in this instance.

It is the intent of the Legislature, as immobilization of motor vehicles by booting in the state of Idaho vitally affects the public interest and the public welfare, and that in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate those who operate motor vehicle booting businesses in Idaho by local government, in order to prevent frauds, impositions, and other abuses upon its citizens. The Legislature finds it necessary to allow local governments to establish minimum consumer protection standards as well as remedies for motorists who suffer property damage as a result of having their motor vehicles booted or who claim to have been wrongfully booted.”

      <ol Class="alpha">
       <li id="t49c19s49-1901aIol1a">
        The expanding regional economy depends on expanding transportation capacity;

       <li id="t49c19s49-1901aIol1b">
        Highway transportation is the major mode for movement of people and goods in the western states;

       (a) Adhere to the principle that each participating jurisdiction should have the freedom to develop vehicle size and weight standards that it determines to be most appropriate to its economy and highway system.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Establish a system authorizing the operation of vehicles traveling between two (2) or more participating jurisdictions at more adequate size and weight standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) Promote uniformity among participating jurisdictions in vehicle size and weight standards on the basis of the objectives set forth in this agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) Secure uniformity insofar as possible, of administrative procedures in the enforcement of recommended vehicle size and weight standards.

      <p>
       (e) Provide means for the encouragement and utilization of research which will facilitate the achievement of the foregoing purposes, with due regard for the findings set forth in section 1 of this article.

        The supreme court’s action in holding this section violative of the equal protection clauses of both the Idaho and the United States Constitutions in
    Thompson v. Hagan
    , 96 Idaho 19, 523 P.2d 1365 (1974), and the legislature’s lack of action in neither reenacting this section nor attempting to correct its constitutional defects, indicate that Idaho’s relevant policies are opposed to the application of a guest statute in cases heard in Idaho.

        Burden of Proof.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an action brought before the guest statute became effective, it was unnecessary that proof be given that the host was guilty of gross negligence. Willi v. Schaefer Hitchcock Co., 53 Idaho 367, 25 P.2d 167 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for the death of a guest, who was riding in an automobile being driven by defendant’s salesman, plaintiffs were required to prove gross negligence in the operation of the automobile. Manion v. Waybright, 59 Idaho 643, 86 P.2d 181 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action under this section for the death of a guest, the burden is on plaintiff to show that the accident was intentional on the part of the operator of the car or was caused by his reckless disregard of the rights of others. Hughes v. Hudelson, 67 Idaho 10, 169 P.2d 712 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for plaintiff to recover for personal injuries sustained while riding as a guest in defendant’s automobile, she must overcome the burden imposed by this section, and a showing of ordinary negligence on the part of defendant will not suffice. Foberg v. Harrison, 71 Idaho 11, 225 P.2d 69 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        If guest seeks to recover from driver on the basis that driver was operating car in reckless disregard of rights of others, he has the burden of proof. Mason v. Mootz, 73 Idaho 461, 253 P.2d 240 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a suit by guest to recover damages from driver arising out of automobile accident, there must be proof that injuries were sustained as the result of reckless disregard of guest’s rights by the driver. Loomis v. Church, 76 Idaho 87, 277 P.2d 561 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a guest case, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the accident was caused by conduct on the part of the defendant amounting to reckless disregard; proof of ordinary negligence will not suffice. Smith v. Sharp, 85 Idaho 17, 375 P.2d 184 (1962).

       <p>
        Since the guest statute’s (this section’s) denial of the guest’s negligence cause of action against his host does not bear a rational relationship to the objectives of the statute of promotion of hospitality, prevention of collusion and parity between licensees and automobile guests and since the statute by denying automobile guests a negligence cause of action against their host, but allowing negligence actions against the host by paying passengers, guests in other automobiles and pedestrians draw an impermissible classification scheme, it is in violation of the equal protection laws guarantees of the Idaho and U.S. Constitutions and the unconstitutionality applies to all pending actions at the date of this decision and to all actions arising in the future. Thompson v. Hagan, 96 Idaho 19, 523 P.2d 1365 (1974). But see Brockman Mobile Home Sales v. Lee, 98 Idaho 530, 567 P.2d 1281 (1977). Contributory Negligence as Defense.

       <p>
        Contributory negligence may be asserted against alleged intoxication or gross negligence, but not against intentional injury under this section as amended in 1963. Hodge v. Borden, 91 Idaho 125, 417 P.2d 75 (1966).

       </p>
       <p>
        Action for damages by guest was properly dismissed as against host driver where the record showed that host was not driving at an excessive rate of speed under the circumstances, and the failure of host to see potato digger in time to avoid accident could not be considered more than ordinary negligence. Turner v. Purdum, 77 Idaho 130, 289 P.2d 608 (1955), overruled on other grounds, Schaub v. Linehan, 92 Idaho 332, 442 P.2d 742 (1968).

       <p>
        In an action for damages for the wrongful death of a child in a two-car collision in which both drivers were killed and to which there were no surviving eyewitnesses, evidence from physical facts after the collision that the car in which the child was a guest passenger was on the wrong side of the road at the time of the collision was sufficient to establish that the driver of such car was guilty of negligence per se, but the negligence so established was ordinary negligence and such physical facts were insufficient to establish gross negligence. Petersen v. Parry, 92 Idaho 647, 448 P.2d 653 (1968).

        Gross Negligence.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Gross negligence, as used in this section, need not include wilfulness, or wanton or intentional disregard for the guest’s safety, or conscious indifference to consequences; and there need not be an actual intent to inflict damage or injury. Hodge v. Borden, 91 Idaho 125, 417 P.2d 75 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        It does not constitute negligence when one who without fault is suddenly and unexpectedly placed in a perilous situation, so as to be compelled to act instantly and without opportunity to exercise deliberate judgment. Swa v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 93 Idaho 275, 460 P.2d 410 (1969).
    Speed alone does not constitute gross negligence. Swa v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 93 Idaho 275, 460 P.2d 410 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a question of gross negligence is present, it is proper for the jury to decide it. Hansen v. Howard O. Miller, Inc., 93 Idaho 314, 460 P.2d 739 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A jury finding of gross negligence may be based upon evidence tending to show a series or a combination of negligent acts. Highbarger v. Thornock, 94 Idaho 829, 498 P.2d 1302 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The operator of a motor vehicle is guilty of gross negligence if he performs an act, or intentionally fails to perform an act, which it is his duty to perform, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonably prudent man to realize that his conduct creates a degree of risk substantially greater than that which would be created by mere negligent conduct. Highbarger v. Thornock, 94 Idaho 829, 498 P.2d 1302 (1972).

        One who accompanied a driver of an automobile for the purpose of showing him how to find a particular place was not a guest under this section, and hence the driver was required to use ordinary care necessary under the circumstances to prevent injury to him. George v. Stanfield, 33 F. Supp. 486 (D. Idaho 1940).

       <p>
        Gratuitous guest cannot recover for host’s negligent operation of automobile in case guest is conscious of danger or is faced with conditions indicating danger, and fails opportunely to protest. French v. Tebben, 53 Idaho 701, 27 P.2d 474 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a football player’s action against teacher for injuries sustained while riding in teacher’s automobile driven by coach, instructions that player was a gratuitous guest and could not recover, unless accident was intentional, or caused by gross negligence, or if he acquiesced in apparent danger, were properly refused, where player had been directed by coach to ride in automobile, since player was not in true sense a “gratuitous guest.” Gorton v. Doty, 57 Idaho 792, 69 P.2d 136 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Idaho legislature has recognized degrees of negligence, and liability to a guest rests on gross negligence. State v. Kouni, 58 Idaho 493, 76 P.2d 917 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        As respects employer’s liability for the death of a guest, who was killed while riding with employer’s traveling salesman, the question whether the guest was employer’s guest, and was being carried in the automobile in the interest of employer’s business, was immaterial. Manion v. Waybright, 59 Idaho 643, 86 P.2d 181 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant’s salesman drove defendant’s automobile into a ditch, at night, and the next morning the body of a guest, who had been riding with the salesman, was found near the place where the automobile stopped, in an action for the death of the guest, evidence sustained the verdict for plaintiffs, as against the contention that the cause of guest’s death was uncertain. Manion v. Waybright, 59 Idaho 643, 86 P.2d 181 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where passenger testified that he told driver of car of condition of village street where a broken water main had caused a natural ditch in highway and passenger was injured by driver striking same, passenger was not guilty of any contributory negligence as a matter of law which proximately caused his injuries. Naccarato v. Village of Priest River, 68 Idaho 368, 195 P.2d 370 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff had previously ridden with third party on round trips between dam and home but rode in car of defendant on trip home as result of promise made by defendant to third party that there would be room for plaintiff the latter was a guest of the defendant. Riggs v. Roberts, 74 Idaho 473, 264 P.2d 698 (1953).
    Plaintiff, a guest, could not recover damages from defendant for injuries sustained when rear tire blew out while defendant was driving 65 miles per hour. Riggs v. Roberts, 74 Idaho 473, 264 P.2d 698 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally speaking a guest is one who takes a ride in a car driven by another person, merely for his own pleasure or on his own business, and without making any return or conferring any benefit on the operator thereof; one who is carried in an automobile gratuitously, that is, one who gives no compensation for the carriage. Buffat v. Schnuckle, 79 Idaho 314, 316 P.2d 887 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at the inception of the trip the relationship was that of plaintiff owner of the automobile and the defendant was the guest and where the granting of defendant’s request to drive was only an act of hospitality, such permission to drive being one which could have been terminated at any time, the status of plaintiff was not that of a “guest without payment” as mentioned in this section; therefore, facts amounting to negligence proximately causing plaintiff’s injury being all that was required, a claim for relief was stated. Peterson v. Winn, 84 Idaho 523, 373 P.2d 925 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        One who rode with another on a trip to a meeting of the Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, to which both belonged, without any agreement for payment for such transportation, but who bought the driver’s lunch on one occasion and paid for gasoline twice was a guest and not a participant in a joint venture.

        In wrongful death action resulting from accident in Idaho resulting in deceased’s death who was riding as guest in defendant’s automobile, the court properly instructed jury that the Idaho guest statute governed. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Newby, 145 F.2d 768 (9th Cir. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by a surviving widow and children to recover damages for the death of the husband and father it was proper to instruct the jury that they might consider both the loss of a legal obligation and of a moral one. McCoy v. Krengel, 52 Idaho 626, 17 P.2d 547 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court’s failure to instruct the jury as to degree of negligence which occupant of an automobile must prove to warrant recovery from driver for injuries is error, requiring reversal, where some instructions related to gross negligence and others to ordinary negligence. French v. Tebben, 53 Idaho 701, 27 P.2d 474 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        An instruction to find for the plaintiffs in an action for injuries to guest in automobile driven by defendant, if jury found from the evidence that one plaintiff received injuries as a proximate result of defendant’s gross negligence or reckless disregard of such plaintiff’s rights, was not erroneous as stating in substance that defendant was grossly negligent, in view of other instructions. Curtis v. Curtis, 58 Idaho 76, 70 P.2d 369 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an automobile occupant’s action for injuries sustained in a collision between meeting automobiles, action of court in instructing jury regarding law applicable to guest riding in automobile was not error where defendants, by answer, charged that occupant was negligent as a guest. Evans v. Davidson, 58 Idaho 600, 77 P.2d 661 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        An instruction defining the phrase “reckless disregard,” as formerly used in this section, as destitute of heed or concern for the consequences, and as an act of such conscious indifference to consequences that the jury is justified in saying that the driver wilfully injured his guest, and that “reckless disregard,” “wilful disregard,” and “wanton disregard” are synonymous terms, was misleading, since “reckless,” as used in the statute, means without thought or care for the consequences, but the instruction was not substantially prejudicial calling for a reversal. Dawson v. Salt Lake Hdwe. Co., 64 Idaho 666, 136 P.2d 733 (1943).
    Instructions on the law of the road, substantially in the language of the statute, were not subject to criticism that they were confusing, and if other instructions were desired, they should have been presented to the trial court, and this included an instruction on the presumption that the deceased guest exercised due care and caution for her own safety. Dawson v. Salt Lake Hdwe. Co., 64 Idaho 666, 136 P.2d 733 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where requested instruction as to the river bank and the objects on the river bank tending to blend with the background and the street lights on both sides of the river continuing in an unbroken line was predicated upon an incorrect presumption that the defendant driver had his headlights illuminated and was otherwise operating his automobile in a reasonably prudent manner, the court correctly refused to give it, as such instruction would have invaded the province of the jury in determining whether driver’s lookout was proper. Smith v. Sharp, 85 Idaho 17, 375 P.2d 184 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for the wrongful death of a child who fell from the hood of a tractor and was run over by a tractor wheel, plaintiff charging that permitting the child to ride upon the hood of the tractor constituted gross and wanton negligence, an instruction in the language of this section was erroneous in that plaintiff had not charged intentional injury or that defendant was intoxicated, but such error was harmless, as the evidence was such that the jury would not have been misled by the instruction, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff’s motion for new trial. Clear v. Marvin, 86 Idaho 87, 383 P.2d 346 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for damages for the wrongful death of a guest passenger, an instruction on ordinary negligence given to help the jury understand gross negligence was not error where the instructions as a whole made it clear that recovery must be predicated upon gross negligence. Mattson v. Bryan, 92 Idaho 587, 448 P.2d 201 (1968).

        An instruction which defined a joint enterprise and advised the jury that, in case they found that the driver and the guest were engaged in a joint enterprise, the driver owed decedent the duty of ordinary care was not erroneous as telling the jury it was a joint enterprise. McCoy v. Krengel, 52 Idaho 626, 17 P.2d 547 (1932).

        In an action for the death of a guest, who was killed while riding in defendant’s automobile, driven by defendant’s salesman, who fell asleep and drove into a ditch, the question whether salesman was guilty of gross negligence, or acted with reckless disregard of the rights of the guest, was for the jury.

        It was within the province of the jury to find whether the benefit or consideration resulting to respondent who had been granted permission to drive his own car by reason of transporting appellant, a fellow officer who had been requested to put on a regimental party, under the circumstances was substantial and of worth to respondent, thusly to constitute payment for transportation within the purview of the guest statute, upon officer having been injured when respondent’s car left highway and upset after colliding with post covered with grass while they were en route back to the regimental headquarters from the park where the party had been supervised by appellant at request of his commanding officer.

Payments so made, aggregating the full sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), shall extinguish all liability of the owner hereunder to the claimants and all other persons on account of the accident.

        For the theory that the finding and judgment of the state court constituted an estoppel to arise, there would have to be a previous opportunity for litigation of the question or an actual previous participation in the litigation by the party against whom the estoppel is asserted or his privy. Where in the state court action appellants were not in an adversary position to the party in whose favor the judgment ran and there were no pleadings between appellants and such parties, hence the issue of permissive use either within the meaning of this section or the insurance policy involved had not yet been litigated upon by appellants or their privies against anyone and they had not had their day in court, there is no estoppel precluding the insurer of the construction company from maintaining an action against the insurer of the truck owner. C.H. Elle Constr. Co. v. Western Cas. & Sur. Co., 261 F.2d 533 (9th Cir. 1958).

        Although the father paid for the vehicle (using the son’s money), he did not possess any right of possession or control over the vehicle and he was not liable for the injuries caused by the son’s driving the vehicle, under the theory of negligent entrustment. Lopez v. Langer, 114 Idaho 873, 761 P.2d 1225 (1988).

        Complaint under this section against a vehicle owner, for allowing a dangerous vehicle to be driven on a public highway, contained no allegation that the claim was based on the employer-employee relationship between the driver and the vehicle owner, therefore,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c16s6-1607" target="_blank">§ 6-1607</a></cite>, covering tort claims based upon the employer-employee relationship did not apply, although the driver was in fact employed by the vehicle owner.

        It was error to grant summary judgment dismissing an imputed liability claim against an employer, based on an employee’s alleged ownership of the employer’s vehicle at the time of an accident, because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the employer’s right to control the vehicle on that date, since (1) a purported agreement selling the vehicle to the employee contained no language of transfer, and (2) the employer apparently had a right to control the vehicle until the purchase price was paid, which occurred after the underlying accident.

     <p>
      The operation by any person, either as principal, master, agent, servant or otherwise, of any motor vehicle, whether registered or unregistered, and with or without a license to operate, on any highway in this state, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by that person of the secretary of state to be his true and lawful attorney, upon whom may be served all lawful summons and processes in any action or proceeding against him, growing out of any accident or collision in which he, either as principal, master, agent, servant, or otherwise, may be involved while operating, causing or permitting the operation of a motor vehicle upon a highway. The operation shall be signification of an agreement by the person that any summons or process against him which is so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on him personally within Idaho. Service of the processes shall be made by leaving a copy of the process, with a fee of five dollars ($5.00), in the hands of the secretary of state or in his office. The service shall be a sufficient and valid personal service upon that person; provided, notice of the service and a copy of the process is sent by registered mail by the plaintiff to the defendant, and the defendant’s return receipt and plaintiff’s affidavit of compliance are appended to the process and entered as a part of the return. Personal service outside of the state in accordance with the provisions of the laws of Idaho relating to personal service of summons outside of the state shall relieve a plaintiff from mailing copies of the summons or process by registered mail as provided in this section. Service of the process upon a defendant shall not be complete until it is either made by registered mail or by personal service outside of the state. The court in which the action is brought may order continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.

           In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his home jurisdiction must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date; or if unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or is taken directly to court for his trial to be held. In some instances, the motorist’s driver’s license may be deposited as collateral to be returned after he has complied with the terms of the citation. The purpose of the practices described is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the traffic citation, could return to his home jurisdiction and disregard his duty under the terms of the traffic citation.

           A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on his way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.
          </li>
          <li id="t49c25s49-2501aIol11c">
           The practice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.
