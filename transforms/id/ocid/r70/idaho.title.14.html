      The county treasurers of the various counties of this state are hereby declared to be ex officio public administrators in their respective counties.

        The public administrator of the county where one dies should be appointed where there are no known heirs, creditors, or claimants, because the legislature evidently intended that the state should receive as large an amount as possible from such escheating estates; a minimum of or no expense would be connected with administration by the public administrator.

        The right of a public administrator to take charge of an estate of a person dying within the administrator’s county with no known heirs is contingent and subject to termination upon application for appointment as administrator by some other qualified person having a prior right.

        Where a resident of Idaho county dies intestate in Nez Perce County leaving an estate consisting of personal property, and a petition was filed on behalf of a total stranger, it was held that the public administrator of Nez Perce County should have been appointed.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a county treasurer is entitled to administer an estate as public administrator, prior to appointment he is authorized to act on behalf of the estate to identify, secure, protect and take charge of all tangible and intangible assets, including incurring reasonable expenses for those purposes, provided that no disbursement from or liquidation of such assets shall be made prior to issuance of letters of administration. Whenever a public administrator takes charge of an estate which he is entitled to administer without letters of administration being issued, or by order of the court, he must, with all convenient dispatch, procure letters of administration thereon. No notice of application for letters by a public administrator is necessary, and his official bond and oath are in lieu of the personal representative’s bond and oath, but when real estate is ordered to be sold, another bond may be required by the court.

        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 97, in the section catchline, substituted “public school permanent endowment fund” for “state treasury”; and substituted the language beginning “which shall accrue and be transferred” for “reported as unclaimed property as required by section 14-517, Idaho Code, and the procedure for distribution of abandoned property outlined in the unclaimed property act shall be followed.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 15, substituted “shall submit a report of abandoned property required under section 14-517, Idaho Code, and proceed to dispose of the property in a manner set forth in the uniform unclaimed property act in chapter 5, title 14, Idaho Code, provided that in the event no person appears to claim such property within one thousand eight hundred twenty-seven (1,827) days, approximately five (5) years from the date the property should have been reported, the money or property so deposited” for “must pay into the state tax commission any and all moneys and effects which”.
    The 2012 amendment, by ch. 215, deleted “required under section 14-517, Idaho Code,” following “a report of abandoned property” near the beginning of the first sentence, substituted “such property shall be identified by the public administrator as section 14-113 abandoned property. The state treasure shall distribute the money” for “in the event no person appears to claim such property within one thousand eight hundred twenty-seven (1,827) days, approximately five (5) years from the date the property should have been reported, the money or property so deposited shall accrue and be transferred”, and added “upon expiration of the period for redemption of the property pursuant to section 14-523, Idaho Code” at the end of the section.
