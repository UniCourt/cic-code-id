      Except as provided in section 5-245, Idaho Code, for execution on judgments for support of a child and for execution on judgments for restitution to victims of crime, the party in whose favor judgment is given may, at any time within ten (10) years after the entry or order of renewal thereof, have a writ of execution issued for its enforcement, subject to the right of the court to stay execution as provided by the rules adopted by the supreme court. The party in whose favor a judgment for restitution to a victim of crime has been entered pursuant to section 19-5305, Idaho Code, may, at any time within twenty (20) years after the entry thereof, have a writ of execution issued for its enforcement, subject to the right of the court to stay execution as provided by the rules adopted by the supreme court.

       <p>
        The 2010 amendment, by ch. 34, substituted “as provided by the rules adopted by the supreme court” for “as herein provided” at the end, and deleted the former second paragraph which read: “In its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party or parties as are proper, the court may stay the execution of, or any proceeding to enforce, a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial made pursuant to section 10-602, Idaho Code, or judgment notwithstanding the verdict made pursuant to sections 10-224 and 10-602, Idaho Code, or a motion for relief from a judgment or order made pursuant to section 5-905, Idaho Code.”
    This section was amended by two 2015 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 139, inserted “and for execution on judgments for restitution to victims of crime” in the first sentence and added the last sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 278, substituted “ten (10) years” for “five (5) years” in the first sentence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 175, inserted “or order of renewal” near the middle of the first sentence.

       <p>
        In mechanic’s lien foreclosure, where two judgment claimants assigned their judgments to another judgment claimant and heirs of deceased owner assigned their interest to same assignee so as to cause a merger of the liens with the title, an unassigned recorded judgment of another claimant is a cloud on the title which must be removed to render same marketable. Brown v. Hawkins, 66 Idaho 351, 158 P.2d 840 (1945), overruled on other grounds, Mitchell v. Flandro, 95 Idaho 228, 506 P.2d 455 (1972).

        Failure of judgment creditor to take out an execution against the judgment debtor within the 16 days between the date of his judgment and the date on which the debtor filed his petition in bankruptcy did not preclude the creditor from urging that the debtor’s bankruptcy relieved him of the duty of taking out an execution against the debtor as a “condition precedent” to action against the sureties of the bond given to discharge the writ of attachment.

      § 11-102. Form of writ.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The writ of execution must be issued in the name of the people, sealed with the seal of the court, and subscribed by the clerk, and be directed to the sheriff, and it must intelligently refer to the judgment, stating the court, the county where the judgment roll is filed, and if it be for money, the amount thereof, and the amount actually due thereon, and if made payable in a specified kind of money, or currency, the execution must also state the kind of money or currency in which the judgment is payable, and must require the sheriff substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c01s11-102ol11">
       If it be against the property of the judgment debtor, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of the personal property of such debtor, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of his real property; or if the judgment be a lien upon real property, then out of the real property belonging to him on the day when the judgment was docketed, or at any time thereafter; or if the execution be issued to a county other than the one in which the judgment was recovered, on the day when the transcript of the docket was filed in the office of the recorder of such county, stating such day, or any time thereafter.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c01s11-102ol12">
       If it be against real or personal property in the hands of the personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants, or trustees, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of such property.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c01s11-102ol13">
       If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it must require the sheriff to arrest such debtor and commit him to the jail of the county until he pay the judgment, with interest, or be discharged according to law.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c01s11-102ol14">
       If it be issued on a judgment made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, it must also require the sheriff to satisfy the same in the kind of money or currency in which the judgment is made payable, and the sheriff must refuse payment in any other kind of money or currency; and in case of levy and sale of property of the judgment debtor, he must refuse payment from any purchaser at such sale in any other kind of money or currency than that specified in the execution. The sheriff collecting money or currency in the manner required by this chapter, must pay to the plaintiff or party entitled to recover the same, the same kind of money or currency received by him, and in case of neglect or refusal so to do, he shall be liable on his official bond to the judgment creditor in three (3) times the amount of the money so collected.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c01s11-102ol15">
       If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, it must require the sheriff to deliver the possession of the same, describing it, to the party entitled thereto, and may at the same time require the sheriff to satisfy any costs, damages, rents or profits recovered by the same judgment, out of the personal property of the person against whom it was rendered, and the value of the property for which the judgment was rendered, to be specified therein, if a delivery thereof cannot be had; and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of the real property, as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

        This statutory directive, that a writ of execution identify the judgment and “the amount thereof,” implicitly requires that the judgment itself state an amount or set forth the method by which an amount can be ascertained. When there exists no judgment (or supplemental order) satisfying this requirement, a writ of execution cannot be issued in compliance with this section. Operating Eng’rs Local Union 370 v.

        Although the plaintiff unions waived their right to take exception to the memorandum of costs filed by the prevailing defendant employer, it did not follow that the memorandum of costs was deemed approved in its entirety and that a writ of execution could be issued thereon; before a writ of execution could issue on a money judgment, the court, by judgment or supplemental order, must have fixed the amount of recovery; accordingly, where the court neither fixed the amount of costs in the judgment itself nor entered a separate order fixing the amount of costs, a writ of execution for the costs should not have been issued.

If any real estate be levied upon, the clerk must record the execution and the return thereto at large, and certify the same under his hand as true copies in a book to be called the “execution book,” which book must be indexed with the names of the plaintiffs and defendants in execution alphabetically arranged, and kept open at all times during office hours for the inspection of the public without charge.

        Perfected security interest survived the secured creditor’s failure to comply with this section because the creditor did not forfeit its security interest by virtue of failing to file a third-party claim, and the doctrine of quasi-estoppel did not bar the creditor from recovering.

        Idaho R. Civ.

        Where the attaching plaintiff never was put to the burden of indemnifying the sheriff because the parties stipulated that the third party could substitute a bond for the value of the automobile to be held by the sheriff in place of the vehicle, the sheriff thus was relieved of any potential liability to the third party for which indemnity would be sought from the attaching plaintiff and the reason for requiring verification did not exist and the provisions of § 8-527 and this section were not applicable; thus, the lack of verification did not bar the subsequent judicial proceeding to determine the third party’s claim to the car.

        Former section is unconstitutional, as it treated husbands and wives unequally. Under this section, the earnings of a wife were exempt from execution against her husband, but the earnings of a husband were not exempt from execution against his wife. Additionally, the unequal treatment under this section was arbitrary and did not demonstrate a substantial relation to the objective of community property legislation. Credit Bureau of E.

      § 11-301. Execution of writ.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The sheriff must execute the writ against the property of the judgment debtor by levying on a sufficient amount of property if there be sufficient; collecting or selling the things in action, and selling the other property, and paying to the plaintiff or his attorney so much of the proceeds as will satisfy the judgment. Any excess in the proceeds over the judgment and accruing costs must be returned to the judgment debtor unless otherwise directed by the judgment or order of the court. When there is more property of the judgment debtor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and accruing costs within the view of the sheriff, he must levy only on such part of the property as the judgment debtor may indicate, if the property indicated be amply sufficient to satisfy the judgment and costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of sections 11-703, 11-706, 11-707, 11-709 and 11-710, Idaho Code, shall apply to a levy upon personal property.

        After the execution has issued and been placed in the hands of the sheriff, there is nothing left for the judgment creditor to do and nothing more could have been done whether he be dead or alive. It would be unreasonable to hold that the sheriff must satisfy himself at the time he makes the sale under execution, or at any other times, that the judgment creditor is alive, or that the execution sale would be void if it happened that at the moment of the sale the judgment creditor was dead.

        The holder of a sheriff’s certificate of sale is entitled to either the possession of property or to demand rent from the tenant or vendee, as the case may be, in possession, from the date of the sale. In the instant case, appellant was let into possession of the property and was entitled to remain in possession provided he made the payments of the purchase-price in accordance with the terms of his contract.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All sales of property under execution must be made at auction, to the highest bidder. After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more can be sold. Neither the officer holding the execution nor his deputy can become a purchaser, or be interested in any purchase, at such sale. When the sale is of personal property, capable of manual delivery, it must be sold in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price; and when the sale is of real property, consisting of several known lots or parcels, they must be sold separately, or when a portion of such real property is claimed by a third person, and he requires it to be sold separately, such portion must be thus sold. The judgment debtor, if present at the sale, may also direct the order in which property, real or personal, shall be sold, when such property consists of several known lots or parcels, or of articles which can be sold to advantage separately, and the sheriff must follow such directions.

     <p>
      Upon a sale of real property the purchaser is substituted to, and acquires all the right, title, interest and claim of the judgment debtor thereto; and all his right, title, interest and claim thereto at any time during any subsisting lien thereon by attachment in the action, or by the docketing of the judgment. When the estate is less than a leasehold of two (2) years’ unexpired term, the sale is absolute. In all other cases the property is subject to redemption, as provided in the next chapter. The officer must give to the purchaser a certificate of sale containing:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c03s11-310ol11">
       A particular description of the real property sold.

      </li>
      <li id="t11c03s11-310ol14">
       When subject to redemption, it must be so stated. And when the judgment, under which the sale has been made, is made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, the certificate must also show the kind of money or currency in which such redemption may be made, which must be the same as that specified in the judgment. A duplicate of such certificate must be filed for record by the officer in the office of the recorder of the county.

      If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the judgment, he may recover the price paid, with interest, from the judgment creditor. If the purchaser of property at sheriff’s sale, or his successor in interest, fail to recover possession in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale, or because the property sold was not subject to execution and sale, the court having jurisdiction thereof, must, after notice and on motion of such party in interest, or his attorney, revive the original judgment in the name of the petitioner, for the amount paid by such purchaser at the sale, with interest thereon from the time of payment at the same rate that the original judgment bore; and the judgment so revived has the same force and effect as would an original judgment of the date of the revival, and no more.

        Where the partition order identified the award as a “down payment” and “balance,” and the proceedings below consistently referred to the judgment creditor’s interest as “a” lien or “the” money judgment, the judgment creditor had only one lien, the one which she executed, and she had no liens separate from or subsequent to the liens she executed upon; therefore, she was not a redemptioner under subsection (2) of this section.

        Where acceptable to the mortgagees, there is no impediment to ordering a simultaneous foreclosure; the foreclosure sale would result in each party being reimbursed by priority to the extent of the proceeds, neither would receive a redemption right and each would receive a deficiency to the extent his or her debt was not satisfied, with appropriate credit being given for the reasonable value of the security.

        In order to establish a stockholder’s right to redeem corporate property from an execution sale, an individual stockholder must show that he first made a bona fide effort to have a redemption made by the directors of the corporation and, failing that, made a like effort with the stockholders as a body, or if he seeks to excuse his own default in that direction, he must show that such efforts to induce a redemption by the directors or stockholders would be an idle ceremony. Wunderlich v. Coeur d’Alene Vulcan Mining Co., 40 Idaho 173, 232 P. 588 (1924).

        Where property was sold under a foreclosure to mortgagees under judgment of foreclosure from which the mortgagors appealed but gave no undertaking to stay execution, and the foreclosure judgment was modified on appeal by eliminating the attorney’s fee, the mortgagors were protected from loss upon redemption by statute providing that the mortgagors need not include the attorney’s fee in the amount necessary to redeem, unless the provisions of the statute, as amended in 1935, were complied with.

        This section does not apply to attorney’s fees allowed in amended order to show cause why the redemption period should not be extended, which fixed a new sum to be paid in redemption and which fees were only for fees incurred by the plaintiff-mortgagee subsequent to plaintiff’s motion for conveyance.

    Where foreclosure sale is made at which the amount of the debt is bid, sheriff’s certificate of sale passes title and the judgment is paid and there no longer exists any indebtedness from mortgagor to mortgagee; the only right remaining in the mortgagor is to divest the purchaser of his title by redemption within one year. Northwestern & Pac. Hypotheekbank v. Nord, 56 Idaho 86, 50 P.2d 4 (1935); Sherwood v. Daly, 58 Idaho 744, 78 P.2d 357 (1938).

        The holder of a sheriff’s certificate of sale is entitled to either the possession of property or to demand rent from the tenant or vendee, as the case may be, in possession, from the date of the sale. In the instant case, appellant was let into possession of the property and was entitled to remain in possession provided he made the payments of the purchase price in accordance with the terms of his contract.

        Redemption of mortgaged premises and recording of certificate thereof nullifies effect of sale and leaves legal title to land same as if foreclosure had not been had. Steinour v. Oakley State Bank, 45 Idaho 472, 262 P. 1052 (1928).

        A redemption when made is not from the mortgage lien but from the execution sale, and a deed subsequently given by the sheriff passes no additional title, but rather evidences that the purchaser’s title has not been divested by redemption.

        § 11-403. Subsequent redemptions.
       </h3>
       <p>
        If property be so redeemed by a redemptioner, another redemptioner may, within sixty (60) days after the last redemption and within one (1) year after the sale, if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of more than twenty (20) acres, and within six (6) months after the sale if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of twenty (20) acres or less, again redeem it from the last redemptioner on paying the sum paid on such last redemption with interest thereon at the rate allowed in section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code, in addition from the date of the last redemption and the amount of any assessment or taxes which the last redemptioner may have paid thereon, after the redemption by him with interest thereon at the rate allowed in section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code, on such amount, and in addition the amount of any liens held by said last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest thereon at the rate allowed in section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code; but the judgment under which the property was sold need not be so paid as a lien.
       </p>
       <p>
        The property may be again, and as often as a redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner, within sixty (60) days after the last redemption and within one (1) year after the sale, if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of more than twenty (20) acres, and within six (6) months after the sale if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land twenty (20) acres or less, on paying the sum paid on the last previous redemption with interest thereon at the rate allowed in section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code, in addition, and the amount of any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption by him, with interest thereon at the rate allowed in section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code, and the amount of any liens, other than the judgment under which the property was sold, held by the last redemptioner previous to his own, with interest thereon at the rate allowed in section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        Written notice of redemption must be given to the sheriff and a duplicate filed for record with the recorder of the county; and, if any taxes or assessments are paid by the redemptioner, or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice thereof must in like manner be given to the sheriff and filed with the recorder, and if such notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed without paying such tax, assessment or lien.
       </p>
       <p>
        If no redemption be made within one (1) year after the sale, if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of more than twenty (20) acres, and within six (6) months after the sale if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of twenty (20) acres or less, the purchaser or his assignee is entitled to a conveyance, or, if so redeemed, whenever sixty (60) days have elapsed and no other redemption has been made, and notice thereon given, the time for redemption by a redemptioner has expired, and the last redemptioner or his assignee is entitled to a sheriff’s deed at the expiration of one (1) year after the sale, if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of more than twenty (20) acres, and within six (6) months after the sale if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of twenty (20) acres or less; but in all cases the judgment debtor shall have the entire period of one (1) year from the date of the sale to redeem the property if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of more than twenty (20) acres and shall have the entire period of six (6) months from the date of sale to redeem the property if the real property sold consisted of a tract of land of twenty (20) acres or less.
    If the judgment debtor redeem he must make the same payments as are required to effect a redemption by a redemptioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a debtor redeem, the effect of the sale is terminated and he is restored to his estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a redemption by the debtor, the person to whom the payment is made must execute and deliver to him a certificate of redemption, acknowledged and proved before an officer authorized to take acknowledgments of conveyances of real property.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such certificate must be filed and recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in which the property is situated, and the recorder must note the record thereof in the margin of the record of the certificate of sale.

      The purchaser, from the time of the sale until a redemption, and a redemptioner from the time of his redemption until another redemption, is entitled to receive, from the tenant in possession, the rents of the property sold, or the value of the use and occupation thereof. But when any rents or profits have been received by the judgment creditor or purchaser, or his or their assigns, from the property thus sold preceding such redemption, the amount of such rents and profits shall be a credit upon the redemption money to be paid; and if the redemptioner or judgment debtor, before the expiration of the time allowed for such redemption, demands in writing of such purchaser, or creditor, or his assigns, a written and verified statement of the amounts of such rents and profits thus received, the period for redemption is extended five (5) days after such sworn statement is given by such purchaser or his assigns, to such redemptioner or debtor. If such purchaser or his assigns shall, for a period of one (1) month from and after such demand, fail or refuse to give such statement, such redemptioner or debtor may, within sixty (60) days after such demand, bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction, to compel an accounting and disclosure of such rents and profits, and until fifteen (15) days from and after the final determination of such action the right of redemption is extended to such redemptioner or debtor.

        During the period of redemption, the mortgagor must pay the purchaser as the owner of the land for its use and occupation; after the sale the title is in the purchaser; redemption merely revives the mortgagor’s title and the statute gives him his due by providing that the rents paid apply on the redemption; the mortgagor is a “tenant in possession” within the meaning of this section.

        In the absence of a demand in writing by assignee of first priority lien for written and verified statement of rents and profits, which would have extended the period of redemption for five days after a sworn statement from foreclosure sale purchaser of such rents and profits, there was no basis to consider an offset of deficiency in redemption money paid by assignee.

      When an execution against property of the judgment debtor or of any of several debtors in the same judgment, issued to the sheriff of the county where he resides, or if he do [does] not reside in this state, to the sheriff of the county where the judgment roll is filed, is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time after such return is made, is entitled to an order from the judge of the court requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer upon oath concerning his property, before such judge, or a referee appointed by him, at a time and place specified in the order; but no judgment debtor must be required to attend before a judge or referee out of the county in which he resides.

     <p>
      After the issuing of an execution against property, and upon proof by affidavit of a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court or of a judge thereof, that any judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment, such court or judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place before such judge, or a referee appointed by him, to answer upon oath concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application of the property of the judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided upon the return of an execution. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge may upon affidavit of the judgment creditor, his agent or attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger of the debtor absconding, order the sheriff to arrest the debtor and bring him before such judge. Upon being brought before the judge, he may be ordered to enter into an undertaking, with sufficient surety, that he will attend from time to time before the judge or referee, as may be directed during the pendency of proceedings and until the final termination thereof, and will not in the meantime dispose of any portion of his property not exempt from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking he may be committed to prison.

       <p>
        Notice of assignment need not be in any particular form, but is sufficient if it advises judgment debtor that person who recovered judgment is no longer owner of it or entitled to collect it. Houtz v. Daniels, 36 Idaho 544, 211 P. 1088 (1922).

        Money debtors had in a credit union account on the day they declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy could be reasonably traced to an Earned Income Credit (“EIC”) in the amount of $3,990 they received two weeks before they declared bankruptcy, and it did not lose its status as exempt property because the debtors placed the funds in the same account that held a Child Tax Credit (“CTC”) and a state tax refund. Although the CTC was not exempt from creditors’ claims under this section, the EIC and the CTC were already commingled before the debtors deposited the funds because both credits were paid in one transfer the debtors received from the U.S. government.

Idaho law allowed the debtor to shield damages she was awarded for bodily injury up to a maximum of $25,000, there was only a minimal delay between the date the court entered its order and the date the debtor filed her motion, and it would have been unfair to penalize the debtor because her attorney failed to respond when the creditor objected to the debtor’s claim.

        Benefits paid or payable by means of disability or illness are exempt from execution or attachment to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and his dependents.

        While the benefits of early retirement incentive program of school district were not a pension or an annuity, it was a “similar plan” that provided retirement benefits to those individuals accepted in the program based on age and length of service; thus, since debtor had no other source of income afforded by regular employment, these funds were necessary for his support and were exempt property under provisions of former subsection (1)(e) of this section.

        Real property may be exempt under subdivision (1)(b) of this section where the underlying right is a right to payment of money; real property transferred in satisfaction of future child support obligations would be exempt where the property was to be sold and the proceeds used to pay the children’s obligations. In re Russell, 163 Bankr. 584 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994).
    Proceeds from the sale of a debtor’s marital homestead were not exempt under subsection (1)(b) of this section as funds necessary to make support payments to his ex-spouse because: (1) the statute provides an exemption of support monies to the extent necessary for the support of a debtor and his dependents, and, thus, it does not allow an exemption for funds paid out by a debtor to benefit another; (2) the statute only exempts money received for support, and here, the funds were received as sale proceeds; and (3) while it was true that the debtor’s ex-spouse had a priority claim under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 507(a)(1) and 726, allowing the debtor to use the sale proceeds to pay support payment would essentially allow him to use an asset of his bankruptcy estate to prefer a particular creditor at the expense of other creditors.

       It is the policy of the state of Idaho to ensure the well-being of its citizens by protecting retirement income to which they are or may become entitled.

       Unless otherwise provided by federal law, any money received by any citizen of the state of Idaho as a pension from the government of the United States, whether the money be in the actual possession of a citizen or be deposited or loaned, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, seizure, or other levy by or under any legal process whatever. When a debtor dies, or absconds, and leaves his family any money exempted by this subsection, the money shall be exempt to the family as provided in this subsection. This subsection shall not apply to any child support collection actions, if otherwise permitted by federal law.

This subsection shall not apply to any child support collection actions, if otherwise permitted by federal law. This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in the plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for those orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in sections 403(b), 408, 408A or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support.

       An employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be a spendthrift trust, regardless of the source of funds, the relationship between the beneficiary and the trustee or custodian of the plan, or the ability of the debtor to withdraw, borrow or otherwise become entitled to benefits from the plan before retirement. This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in the plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for those orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in sections 403(b), 408, 408A or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect before 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides home maintenance or support.
    (6) Unless contrary to applicable federal law, nothing contained in subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section shall be construed as a termination or limitation of a spouse’s community property interest in an individual retirement account held in the name of, or on account of, the other spouse, the “account holder spouse.” At the death of the nonaccount holder spouse, the account holder spouse may transfer or distribute the community property interest of the nonaccount holder spouse in the account holder spouse’s individual retirement account to the nonaccount holder spouse’s estate, testamentary trust, inter vivos trust, or other successor or successors pursuant to the last will of the nonaccount holder spouse, or the law of intestate succession if applicable, and that distributee may, but shall not be required to, obtain an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, including a nonjudicial dispute resolution agreement, or other order, entered to confirm the distribution. For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the distributee of the nonaccount holder spouse’s community property interest in an individual retirement account shall be considered a person entitled to the full protection of subsection (3) of this section. The nonaccount holder spouse’s consent to a beneficiary designation by the account holder spouse with respect to an individual retirement account shall not, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, be deemed a release, gift, relinquishment, termination, limitation or transfer of the nonaccount holder spouse’s community property interest in an individual retirement account. For purposes of this subsection, the term “nonaccount holder spouse” means the spouse of the person in whose name the individual retirement account is maintained. The term “individual retirement account” includes an individual retirement account and an individual retirement annuity both as described in section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a Roth individual retirement account as described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and an individual retirement bond as described in section 409 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect before January 1, 1984.

        For the purposes of this exemption statute, “employee benefit plan” is defined expansively to include “any plan or arrangement” described in one of six sections of 42 USCS § 408, which governs the establishment and operation of IRAs. Accordingly, in Idaho, a bankruptcy debtor may exempt his or her interest in a qualified IRA. In re Smith, 570 B.R. 844 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2017).

        Bankruptcy court denied a bankruptcy trustee’s objections to Chapter 7 debtors’ actions two weeks before declaring bankruptcy, where debtors withdrew $12,000 cash value from a life insurance policy, claimed exemption for the $4,872 remaining in the policy under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t11c06s11-605" target="_self">§ 11-605</a></cite>(10), and purchased two $6,000 IRAs and claimed exemption for them under this section.

        The manner in which the debtors’ exemption was asserted suggested that part of the value in a 401(k) was not claimed exempt and, thus, remained part of the bankruptcy estate.

        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 112, rewrote subsection (9), which formerly read: “Any unmatured life insurance contract owned by an individual, other than a credit life insurance contract”; deleted former subsection (10), which read: “An individual’s aggregate interest, not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) in any accrued dividend or interest under, or loan value of, any unmatured life insurance contract owned by the individual under which the insured is the individual or a person of whom the individual is a dependent”; and redesignated former subsections (11) and (12) as present subsections (10) and (11).

    Commissions that a debtor received after she declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy, when an insured renewed a policy that the debtor had sold to the insured before she declared bankruptcy, were property of her bankruptcy estate, because the right to receive those commissions existed pre-petition and the debtor was not required to perform personal services postpetition to receive renewal commissions. However, to the extent that the first-year commissions and the first-year advances that the debtor received pre-petition were property of her bankruptcy estate, 75% of those payments were exempt from creditors’ claims under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t11c02s11-207" target="_self">§ 11-207 </a></cite>and the debtor could exempt the balance of those earnings, and part of her renewal commissions, under this section.

        Court sustained a Chapter 7 trustee’s objection to debtors’ claim that a boat was exempt as an heirloom under paragraph (1)(c), where their deceased son purchased the boat from his aunt and they acquired the boat from his probate estate and intended to hold it until his son reached the age of majority, as this was not a multi-generational transfer.

       <p>
        The trustee’s objection to the Chapter 7 debtor’s exemption under this section was sustained to the extent that it contested exemption of accrued dividends or interest under, or loan value of, the insurance policies in excess of $5,000 in the aggregate, but such objection would otherwise be overruled. In re Oxford, 274 B.R. 887 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2002) (see 2015 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemptions under former subsection (10) [now repealed] may only be taken by those who own an unmatured life insurance policy, and, even then, only if the person claiming the exemption is the insured or a dependent of the insured. Although parents own insurance policies on various minor children, they may not claim an exemption in those policies, and wife cannot claim an exemption on a policy owned by her husband. In re Steiner, 459 B.R. 748 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2010) (see 2015 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife who declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy properly claimed the exemption allowed by former subsection (10) [now repealed] of this section in the cash surrender value of a policy that insured her life, even though her husband owned the policy, because she had an ownership interest in the policy under Idaho’s community property law. The husband purchased the policy on his wife’s life after their marriage, and they paid all premiums due on the policy using community property funds. In re Thompson, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 2654 (Bankr. D. Idaho July 11, 2011) (see 2015 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy court denied a bankruptcy trustee’s objections to Chapter 7 debtors’ actions two weeks before declaring bankruptcy, where debtors withdrew $12,000 cash value from a life insurance policy, claimed exemption for the $4,872 remaining in the policy under former subsection (10) [now repealed], and purchased two $6,000 IRAs and claimed exemption for them under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t11c60s11-604A" target="_self">§ 11-604A</a></cite>. The debtors were allowed to maximize their exemptions before they declared bankruptcy and did not commit fraud on their creditors. In re Thomas, 477 B.R. 778 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2012) (see 2015 amendment).
    Trustee acted properly when he filed an objection to the debtor’s claim that the cash value of five insurance policies that the debtor owned was exempt from creditors’ claims under former subsection (10) [now repealed] and obtained an order which allowed him to liquidate all five policies and pay the debtor $5,000 out of $75,033 in proceeds that he received from the insurance company. Although the debtor could have claimed that the policies were exempt under subsection (9), he failed to do so. The trustee was not obliged to divine that the debtor intended to rely on subsection (9), when he claimed exemptions under former subsection (10) [now repealed]. In re Wisdom, 478 B.R. 394 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2012) (see 2015 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsections (9) and former (10) [now repealed] were intended by the legislature to protect two different types of interests in unmatured life insurance contracts: subsection (9) exempts the life insurance policy, while former subsection (10) [now repealed] exempts the life insurance policy’s cash value. In re Wisdom, 478 B.R. 394 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2012) (see 2015 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a debtor exempts a life insurance policy under subsection (9), the trustee cannot surrender the policy. Instead, the trustee may exercise other rights under the policy, such as directly borrowing the loan value of the policy leaving the debtor with the insurance policy in place, but encumbered by the loans, subject to the debtor’s right to exempt $5,000 of the loan value, dividends, or interest. Wisdom v. Gugino (In re Wisdom), 490 B.R. 412 (D. Idaho 2013), aff’d, 649 Fed. Appx. 583 (9th Cir. 2016) (see 2015 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a debtor wishes to exempt an insurance policy under subsection (9), he must actually claim that exemption. Debtor does not implicitly exempt an insurance policy under subsection (9), when he only claims an exemption under former subsection (10) [now repealed]. Wisdom v. Gugino (In re Wisdom), 490 B.R. 412 (D. Idaho 2013), aff’d, 649 Fed. Appx. 583 (9th Cir. 2016) (see 2015 amendment).

        A mobile home may be claimed as a homestead exemption in bankruptcy proceedings, but may not be claimed as a personal property exemption. In re Rogers, 225 Bankr. 755 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the debtor sought to claim an exemption in a mobile home that she owned with her mother, pursuant to subsection (10) of this section and 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3)(B), she failed to show that her interest in the mobile home was exempt from process under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t11c06s11-609" target="_self">§ 11-609</a></cite>.

       <p>
        This section does not preclude debtors from applying each of their exemptions to the same motor vehicle, or each individual exemption to a separate motor vehicle. In re Jackson, 147 Bankr. 49 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In Chapter 7 proceedings, since there was no written loan agreement between the debor and her creditor father, there was no perfected security interest which could be avoided by the bankruptcy trustee, and, thus, debtor was entitled to a $3000 motor vehicle exemption from proceeds of the sale of her vehicle. In re Seibold, 351 B.R. 741 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2006) (now $7000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy court sustained a Chapter 7 trustee’s objection to a debtor’s claim that an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) that the trustee recovered from a person who bought the ATV from the debtor was the debtor’s property, and that $800 of the ATV’s value was exempt from creditors’ claims. In re Ady, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 3077 (Bankr. D. Idaho Aug. 25, 2010).
    An all-terrain vehicle does not qualify for Chapter 7 exemption. The restricted license plate did not allow it to be driven on most Idaho roads, nor were any safety mechanisms required to obtain such a license; it remained non-exempt even after the amendments to the license and registration requirements for ATVs under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c71s67-7122" target="_blank">§ 67-7122</a></cite>. In re Bosworth, 449 B.R. 104 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The motor vehicle exemption in subsection (3) does not include off-road vehicles, recreational vehicles, or those vehicles whose operation on the public highways would be illegal. In re Haworth, 604 B.R. 394 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the trustee has shown that a 1937 Ford is not properly equipped to operate on Idaho roads, he has met his burden to prove that the Ford does not qualify as a motor vehicle for purposes of the exemption in subsection (3). The burden, then, shifts to the debtors to demonstrate that the exemption is proper. In re Haworth, 604 B.R. 394 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2019).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The fact that an animal does not physically reside within a debtor’s house should not be determinative of whether that animal is to be classified as a household pet, since many people keep their pets outside while still regarding them as a part of the family’s domestic setting. In re Gallegos, 226 Bankr. 111 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a family kept a horse in their rural home as their only pet, used it for purely personal purposes, and expended modest amounts on its upkeep, they could claim a household pet exemption. In re Gallegos, 226 Bankr. 111 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A family horse could be claimed as a household pet, since any attempt to abuse that exemption, such as claiming a thoroughbred race horse as a pet, would have been bridled not only by the “personal use” requirements, but by the dollar limitation contained in the statute. In re Gallegos, 226 Bankr. 111 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).

        Whether a particular item of household furnishings and appliances is reasonably necessary depends in part upon local custom and usage which may change over time. In re Biancavilla, 173 Bankr. 930 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994) (“reasonably necessary” requirements abolished by 1999 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        VCRs, televisions and stereos are now so prevalent in local households, they are reasonably necessary household furnishings and appliances and may be claimed as an exemption under subsection (1)(a) of this section; however, more than one TV or VCR should not be reasonably necessary to furnish a household and, thus, debtors will not be allowed to exempt any additional TVs, VCRs, or stereo entertainment units. In re Biancavilla, 173 Bankr. 930 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994) (“reasonably necessary” requirements abolished by 1999 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        While an exemption for utility, patio furniture and an entertainment cabinet will be allowed under subsection (1)(a) of this section, sporting goods, bowling balls, golf clubs, fishing equipment, camping equipment, video games and cameras are recreational items and recreational equipment is not reasonably necessary for the household and is, therefore, not exempt. In re Biancavilla, 173 Bankr. 930 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994) (“reasonably necessary” requirements abolished by 1999 amendment).
    Since a computer, computer system and software are luxury items as compared to reasonably necessary household items, claims for exemption of these items will not be allowed; however, a computer desk which is serviceable as an ordinary desk would be exempted. In re Biancavilla, 173 Bankr. 930 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994) (“reasonably necessary” requirements abolished by 1999 amendment).

        Creditor’s contention that debtors’ television, stereo and VCR are not exempt household furnishings or appliances runs contrary to long-standing rulings recognizing that these kinds of items may be exempted as reasonably necessary household appliances. In re Kinnemore, 181 Bankr. 516 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1995) (“reasonably necessary” requirements abolished by 1999 amendment).
       </p>

        What may be considered reasonable and necessary furnishings and appliances in a bankruptcy proceeding is determined in part by local custom and usage. In re Andrews, 225 Bankr. 485 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998) (“reasonably necessary” requirements abolished by 1999 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        A certain amount of decorative items and hand tools are reasonable furnishings for a household, although a specific item of art which had a significant value or which was not commonly found in most households might be outside the scope of the statute. In re Andrews, 225 Bankr. 485 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998) (“reasonably necessary” requirements abolished by 1999 amendment).

        Karaoke machine could not be exempted as a “tool of the trade”; debtor could still pursue his profession without the use of the Karaoke machine, as it was not essential in protecting and continuing debtor’s living as a bar or restaurant manager. In re Fancher, 168 Bankr. 712 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that a debtor uses an item in the earning of his livelihood is not sufficient to allow an exemption of the item under subsection (3) of this section; however where an employer expends money for the purpose of allowing an employee to work at home, those items actually used by the debtor to work at home may be considered tools of the trade and therefore exempt under this section. In re Biancavilla, 173 Bankr. 930 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1994) (see 2010 amendment).

       <p>
        Chapter 7 debtor, who previously designed furniture for a living and hoped to return to that occupation when he was physically and financially able to do so, was not entitled to claim an exemption for his woodworking tools as “tools of the trade” because the tools were not needed for his current, successful position as a window salesman. In re Moore, 349 B.R. 44 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Chapter 7 debtors, a physician and an accountant, were not entitled to an exemption under subsection (3) of this section for farm equipment as tools or implements because farming could not be considered the debtors’ occupation and it did not generate income necessary for the debtors’ continued financial support. In re McHugh, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 2105 (Bankr. D. Idaho May 27, 2010).
    Where debtor had formerly worked as a carpenter, but was currently working laying concrete, a tool trailer and a compressor, and other tools formerly used in his carpentry work, were not necessary for the debtor’s continued financial support and, therefore, were not exempt under subsection (3). The debtor’s concrete work provided an adequate income to meet his family’s basic needs at the present time. In re Blackburn, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 178 (Bankr. D. Idaho Jan. 19, 2011).

        Under this section, Idaho debtors may access exemptions allowed under Idaho law, as well as those listed in 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3). In re Thomason, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 886 (Bankr. D. Idaho Feb. 19, 2013).

       <p>
        Idaho has “opted-out” of the federal bankruptcy exemptions, and its citizens are limited to the exemptions allowed under state law. In re Millsap, 122 Bankr. 577 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Idaho opted out of the federal bankruptcy exemptions, a Chapter 7 debtor may utilize only the exemptions provided under state law pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3) and this section; although Idaho’s exemption statutes are to be liberally construed in the debtor’s favor, they may not be “tortured” in the guise of liberal construction. In re Grimmett, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 968 (Bankr. D. Idaho Mar. 24, 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the debtor sought to claim an exemption in a mobile home that she owned with her mother, pursuant to subsection (10) of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t11c06s11-605" target="_self">§ 11-605 </a></cite>and 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3)(B), she failed to show that her interest in the mobile home was exempt from process under this section. In re Antonie, 432 B.R. 843 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2010), aff’d, 447 B.R. 610 (D. Idaho 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3)(A), Chapter 7 debtors who resided in Idaho were required to apply the Idaho homestead exemption,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.55.html#t55c10s55-1001" target="_blank">§§ 55-1001</a></cite>, 55-1003, and 55-1004; the debtors could not apply the Idaho homestead exemption to a home located in Washington state and could not apply Washington state homestead law to their case in Idaho. In re Harris, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 2020 (Bankr. D. Idaho June 23, 2010).

        Because Idaho has opted out of the Bankruptcy Code’s exemption scheme, debtors in Idaho may claim only those exemptions allowable under Idaho law, as well as those listed in 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3).

      If service of the attachment, execution or garnishment papers is not made on the designated office of the financial institution, but instead is made on another office of the financial institution located in the state of Idaho, then service of such papers shall be valid and effective as to moneys to the judgment debtor’s credit in that particular office and as to other personal property belonging to the judgment debtor held in the possession or control of that particular office, but shall only become valid and effective as to moneys to the judgment debtor’s credit held in the possession or control of any of the financial institution’s other offices upon receipt of the attachment, execution or garnishment papers by the designated office. Such financial institution may, but is under no obligation to, transmit the original or a copy of the papers from the particular office served to the designated office.
    Service on any financial institution is effective as against the moneys and other personal property to the judgment debtor’s credit which are in the possession or control of the financial institution named in the garnishment, but not any affiliate, parent or subsidiary not named. If the garnishment fails to sufficiently distinguish the financial institution from any affiliate, parent or subsidiary thereof, such that it is not clear which entity is intended to be the garnishee, the garnishment may be returned unsatisfied.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the garnishee is the employer of the judgment debtor, the judgment creditor, upon application to the court, shall have issued by the clerk of court, a continuing garnishment directing the employer-garnishee to pay to the sheriff such future moneys coming due to the judgment debtor as may come due to said judgment debtor as a result of the judgment debtor’s employment. This continuing garnishment shall continue in force and effect until the judgment is satisfied. The judgment creditor shall be solely responsible for ensuring that the amounts garnished do not exceed the amount due on the judgment. If additional garnishments are issued during the term of a continuing garnishment and the continuing garnishment is the maximum allowed under the provisions of section 11-712, Idaho Code, the additional garnishments cannot be served until the continuing garnishment is satisfied, or until the amount taken by the continuing garnishment is less than the maximum allowed. Additional garnishments issued during the term of a continuing garnishment must be served in the order in which presented.

      <li id="t11c07s11-714ol11">
       If a notice of garnishment is served upon a financial institution that has an account or accounts of the debtor, the financial institution shall conduct a garnishment review of all accounts in the name of the debtor before taking any action that may affect funds in those accounts.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07s11-714ol12">
       The garnishment review shall be limited to the sixty-four (64) day period immediately preceding the date of service upon the financial institution of the garnishment. Solely for purposes of the garnishment review, any balance in the accounts on the sixty-fourth day immediately preceding the date of service upon the financial institution of the garnishment shall be deemed to be exempt. If the financial institution determines, solely from information transmitted to the financial institution by the payor, that one (1) or more payments of exempt funds as described in section 11-713(1), (2) or (3), Idaho Code, were deposited by direct or electronic deposit payment in an account of the debtor the total balance of deposited exempt funds in the debtor account is not subject to garnishment.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07s11-714ol13">
       The financial institution conducting the garnishment review need only review information transmitted to the financial institution by the payor of direct or electronic deposit payments in making its determination that funds in the accounts are of the types of payments described in section 11-713(1), (2) or (3), Idaho Code. The financial institution conducting the garnishment review shall have no obligation to inquire into the source of funds or examine any deposit item made by any means other than direct or electronic deposit, even if such review would disclose that the funds so deposited may be exempt from garnishment as described in section 11-713(1), (2) or (3), Idaho Code.

       If a notice of right to garnish federal benefits from the United States government or from a state child support enforcement agency is attached to or included in the garnishment as provided in 31 CFR 212, the financial institution shall not conduct a garnishment account review under this section and shall proceed on the garnishment.

       A financial institution conducting a garnishment review as required by this section is immune from civil liability to the garnishor, debtor or account owner from any act or omission with respect to the garnishment review, including without limitation, any incorrect determination made after applying good faith methods for determining whether funds in an account are exempt. If a court determines that a financial institution erred in its identification of funds in an account as exempt or nonexempt, the sole remedy in exemption proceedings shall be issuance of an order of the court that the financial institution must adjust its actions with respect to a writ of execution as soon as possible. A financial institution is not liable to an account holder or garnishor, and may not be assessed any penalty, by reason of any action or inaction in good faith including:
