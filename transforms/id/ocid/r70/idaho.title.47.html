      The Idaho geological survey is hereby authorized to utilize in its study of regional geology, mineral deposits, industrial minerals and aggregates, oil and gas resources, and groundwater resources, in its dissemination of geological and mineral data, and in its publication of reports and maps on the geology and mineral resources of the state, any information derived from samples and records deposited with it. The Idaho geological survey shall not disclose any record, or any information contained therein, if the record or information is exempt from disclosure under the Idaho public records act, chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, or is subject to a confidentiality agreement between the Idaho geological survey and the owner or owners of the records or information. Should a confidentiality or data-sharing agreement exist, the terms of that agreement shall control any disclosure by the Idaho geological survey. For information that becomes publicly available or that is not exempt from disclosure under the Idaho public records act, the existence of a confidentiality or data-sharing agreement will not extend the period of confidentiality beyond that available under the Idaho public records act. Subject to any confidentiality or data-sharing agreement, the Idaho geological survey is authorized to share such records or information obtained under section 47-306, Idaho Code, or information derived therefrom, with the Idaho oil and gas conservation commission and the Idaho department of lands, in furtherance of the respective authorized functions of the commission and the Idaho department of lands. The sharing of information between the Idaho geological survey, the oil and gas conservation commission and the Idaho department of lands shall not render the shared information subject to disclosure to other persons under the Idaho public records act.

       An order establishing spacing units shall specify the size, shape and location of the units, which shall be such as will, in the opinion of the department, result in the efficient and economical development of the pool as a whole. Any unit established by the department shall be geographic. The geographic boundaries of the unit shall be described in accordance with the public land survey system. Except where circumstances, geologic or otherwise, affecting the orderly development of a pool reasonably require, or as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the size of the spacing units shall not be smaller than the maximum area that can be efficiently and economically drained by one (1) well; provided:

If the department finds that a well drilled at the prescribed location would not be likely to produce in paying quantities, or that surface conditions would substantially add to the burden or hazard of drilling such well, or for other good cause shown, the department is authorized to make an order permitting the well to be drilled at a location other than that prescribed by such spacing order. Application for an exception shall be filed with the department and may be granted where it is shown that good cause for such exception exists and that consent to such exception has been given by the operators of all drilling units directly or diagonally offsetting the drilling unit for which an exception is requested, and, as to the lands upon which drilling units have not been established, by the majority of mineral interest owners of those lands which would be included in directly or diagonally offsetting drilling units under said order, if said order were extended to include such additional lands.

A pool may be divided into zones and a spacing unit for each zone may be established if necessary to prevent or assist in preventing waste of oil and gas, to avoid drilling unnecessary wells, to protect correlative rights or to facilitate production through the use of innovative drilling and completion methods. The spacing units within the zone may differ in size and shape from spacing units in any other zone but may not be smaller than the maximum area that can be efficiently and economically drained by one (1) well.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t47c03s47-320ol11">
       When two (2) or more separately owned tracts are embraced within a spacing unit, or when there are separately owned interests in all or a part of a spacing unit, the interested persons may integrate their tracts or interests for the development and operation of the spacing unit. In the absence of voluntary integration, the department, upon the application of any owner in that proposed spacing unit, shall order integration of all tracts or interests in the spacing unit for drilling of a well or wells, development and operation thereof and for the sharing of production therefrom. The department, as a part of the order establishing a spacing unit or units, may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the royalty interests in the unit or units shall, in the absence of voluntary agreement, be deemed to be integrated without the necessity of a subsequent separate order integrating the royalty interests. Each such integration order shall be upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c03s47-320ol12">
       All operations, including, but not limited to, the commencement, drilling, or operation of a well upon any portion of a spacing unit for which an integration order has been entered, shall be deemed for all purposes the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the spacing unit by the several owners thereof. That portion of the production allocated to a separately owned tract included in a spacing unit shall, when produced, be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such tract by a well drilled thereon.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c03s47-320ol13">
       Each such integration order shall authorize the drilling, equipping and operation, or operation, of a well on the spacing unit; shall designate an operator for the integrated unit; shall prescribe the time and manner in which all the owners in the spacing unit may elect to participate therein; and shall make provision for the payment by all those who elect to participate therein of the reasonable actual cost thereof, plus a reasonable charge for supervision and interest. Each such integration order shall provide for the four (4) following options:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t47c03s47-320ol13a">
         Working interest owner. An owner who elects to participate as a working interest owner shall pay the proportionate share of the actual costs of drilling and operating a well allocated to the owner’s interest in the spacing unit. Working interest owners who share in the costs of drilling and operating the well are entitled to their respective shares of the production of the well. The operator of the integrated spacing unit and working interest owners shall enter into a joint operating agreement approved by the department in the integration order.

        <li id="t47c03s47-320ol13b">
         Nonconsenting working interest owner. An owner who refuses to share in the risk and actual costs of drilling and operating the well, but desires to participate as a working interest owner, is a nonconsenting working interest owner. The operator of the integrated spacing unit shall be entitled to recover a risk penalty of up to three hundred percent (300%) of the nonconsenting working interest owner’s share of the cost of drilling and operating the well under the terms set forth in the integration order. After all the costs have been recovered by the consenting owners in the spacing unit, the nonconsenting owner is entitled to his respective shares of the production of the well, and shall be liable for his pro rata share of costs as if the nonconsenting owner had originally agreed to pay the costs of drilling and operating the well. The operator of the integrated spacing unit and nonconsenting working interest owners shall enter into a joint operating agreement approved by the department in the integration order.

       For the purposes of paying the expenses of administration of this act and for the privilege of extracting oil and gas in this state, there is hereby levied and imposed on all oil and gas produced, saved and sold or transported from the premises in Idaho where produced a tax of two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the gross income received by the producer of the oil and gas produced. “Gross income” shall mean the amount realized by the producer for sale of the oil and gas, whether the sale occurs at the wellhead or after transportation of the product, without deduction for marketing, transportation, manufacturing, and processing costs borne by the producer. Where the parties to the sale are related parties and the sales price is lower than the price for which that oil and gas could otherwise have been sold to a ready, willing, and able buyer and where the taxpayer was legally able to sell the oil and gas to such a buyer, gross income shall be determined by reference to comparable arms-length sales of like kind, quality, and quantity in the same field or area. For purposes of this subsection, “related parties” shall be as defined in section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code, as defined, in section 63-3004, Idaho Code. This tax is in addition to all other taxes provided by law. It shall be the duty of the state tax commission to enforce collection of this tax and to make such rules as may be necessary, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. All money so collected shall be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the oil and gas conservation fund, which fund is hereby created in the office of the state treasurer of the state of Idaho.

       The persons owning an interest, working interest, royalty interest, payments out of production, or any other interest in the oil and gas, or in the proceeds thereof, shall be liable for such tax in proportion to their ownership at the time of production. The tax so assessed and fixed shall be payable monthly, and the sum so due shall be remitted to the state tax commission, on or before the twentieth of the month following the month in which the tax accrued, by the producer on behalf of himself and all other interested persons. The person remitting the tax, as herein provided, is hereby empowered and required to deduct from any amounts due the persons owning an interest in the oil and gas, or in the proceeds thereof, at the time of production a proportionate amount of such tax before making payment to such persons.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c03s47-330ol13">
       The tax imposed by this section shall apply to all lands in the state of Idaho, anything in this act to the contrary notwithstanding; provided however, there shall be exempted from the tax hereinabove levied and assessed the following, to wit:

Said sections shall for this purpose be considered a part of this act and wherever liens or any other proceedings are defined as income tax liens or proceedings they shall, when applied in enforcement or collection pursuant to this act, be described as an oil and gas tax lien or proceeding.

        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 187, made several technical corrections in this section.

       <p>
        The 2015 amendment, by ch. 274, rewrote subsection (1), which formerly read: “For the purposes of paying the expenses of administration of this act and for the privilege of extracting oil and gas in this state, there is hereby levied and imposed on all oil and gas produced, saved and sold or transported from the premises in Idaho where produced a tax of two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the market value of the oil or gas produced at the site of production. If the oil and gas is transported from the premises prior to sale, then the tax will be determined based on the published henry hub spot price for gas or wti cushing spot price for crude oil at the close of business the day the oil or gas leaves the premises. Transportation from the premises prior to the sale does not include movement of oil or gas from the wellhead to another site in Idaho by the same person for dehydration or other processing required for sale. This tax is in addition to all other taxes provided by law. It shall be the duty of the state tax commission to enforce collection of this tax and to make such rules as may be necessary, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. All money so collected shall be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the oil and gas conservation fund, which fund is hereby created in the office of the state treasurer of the state of Idaho.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2017 amendment, by ch. 271, in subsection (1), substituted “oil and gas” for “oil or gas” two times in the first and second sentences and inserted “marketing” preceding “transportation, manufacturing, and processing costs” near the end of the first sentence; in subsection (2), in the second sentence, substituted “payable monthly” for “payable quarterly” near the beginning and substituted “month following the month” for “next month following the preceding quarter” near the middle; in subsection (3), substituted “oil and gas” for “oil or gas” in paragraphs (a) and (b); in paragraph (5)(b), rewrote paragraph (i), which formerly read: “Twenty-eight percent (28%) is hereby appropriated and shall be paid to the current expense fund of the county from which the oil or gas was produced” and deleted former paragraph (iv), which read: “Sixteen percent (16%) shall be transferred to the local economic development account that is hereby created in the agency asset fund to provide assistance in those counties experiencing a severe economic hardship due to the cutback or closure of business and industry associated with oil or gas production”.

Provided, however, that whenever the aggregate amount of royalties due to a royalty owner for a twelve (12) month period is less than one hundred dollars ($100), the operator may remit the royalties on an annual basis without any interest due.

        It was not essential that the locator of a mining claim be the first discoverer of a vein or lode in order to make a valid location, and if it appeared the locator knew at the time of making his location that there had been a discovery of a vein or lode within the limits of his location, he could base his location upon it and, thus, avoid the necessity of making a discovery for himself.

        Where the exterior boundaries of a mineral location included such an unreasonably excessive area that such boundary lines could not be said to impart notice to prospector of mineral location or discovery within reasonable distance of a lawful claim as located under former statute, such location would be held void.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The locator of a mining claim must at the time of making his location designate his claim by posting at one (1) corner of the claim his notice of location in writing in which there shall be stated:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t47c06s47-602ol11">
       The name of the locator or locators.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c06s47-602ol12">
       The name of the claim and whether located as a lode mining claim or as a placer mining claim.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c06s47-602ol13">
       The date of the location and the mining district, if any, and the county in which the claim is located.

      <li id="t47c06s47-602ol14">
       The directions and distances which describe the claim.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c06s47-602ol15">
       The direction and distance from the corner where notice is posted to such natural object or permanent monument, if any such there be, as will fix and describe in the notice itself the site of the claim.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Before recording his notice of location, the locator must mark the boundaries of his mining claim by placing at each corner or angle of the claim a substantial monument or a post at least four (4) feet in height and four (4) inches square or in diameter. Each post and monument shall be marked with the name of the claim, the position or number of the corner or angle and the direction of the boundary lines. The locator shall mark the boundary lines so that they can be readily traced. Where it is impracticable to place a monument or post in its true position, a witness monument shall be erected and marked to indicate the true position of the corner or angle.

        Location notice must have described claim by reference to some natural object or permanent monument which would identify claim and would furnish reasonable certainty that locus of claim had not been, and could not well be, changed; reference must have been such as would enable skilled engineer to identify claim without reference to contiguous claims, location of which were uncertain, and courses and distances from permanent monument to discovery stakes or corner stakes must have been stated with reasonable accuracy.

        Where the location of mining claim was made in good faith, court would not hold locator to a very strict compliance with the law in respect to his location notice. If by any reasonable construction, in view of surrounding circumstances, language employed in description would impart notice to subsequent locators, it was sufficient. Natural objects or permanent monuments referred to in statutes could have been on ground located, or off. Bismarck Mt. Gold Mining Co. v.

    Intent of prior law was to require locator to make his location so definite and certain that, from location notice and stakes and monuments on ground, limits and boundaries of the claim could have been readily ascertained, and so definite and certain as to have prevented changing or floating of claim.

        Adverse Possession.

       <p>
        Under 30 U.S.C.S. § 38, claimant to mineral lands who has been in adverse possession for continuous period equal to that required by local statute of limitations is relieved of necessity of making proof of recording a notice of location. Humphreys v. Idaho Gold Mines Dev. Co., 21 Idaho 126, 120 P. 823 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        It still remains for persons who assert claim by adverse possession to have mineral discovery and perform assessment work. They must also mark boundaries of claim so as to afford actual notice of extent of possession and exclude all adverse claimants for full period of statute. They must likewise maintain possession and occupancy during subsequent period when adverse locator attempts to initiate right by locating claim. Law v. Fowler, 45 Idaho 1, 261 P. 667 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Possession of unpatented mining claims is actual possession, not constructive possession. “Actual possession” means something more than mere compliance with requirements of assessment work. Law v. Fowler, 45 Idaho 1, 261 P. 667 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Adverse claimant of mining right must institute action within thirty days from filing adverse claim or within ninety days of first publication of notice, or court has no jurisdiction to pass upon his claim. Little v. Morris, 48 Idaho 740, 284 P. 1029 (1930).

       <p>
        One who adversely claims title to a mining claim by forfeiture and relocation must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the annual labor was not performed and must prove that his or her own locations are valid. Golden Condor, Inc. v. Bell, 106 Idaho 280, 678 P.2d 72 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although an adverse claimant has the ultimate burden of proof — i.e., the risk of nonpersuasion — on the question of whether annual labor was performed, the party asserting that such work was done has an initial burden of going forward with prima facie evidence and the filing of an affidavit under this section suffices to meet this initial burden; the adverse claimant must overcome the affidavit or other prima facie proof by clear and convincing evidence that the work was not performed. Golden Condor, Inc. v. Bell, 106 Idaho 280, 678 P.2d 72 (Ct. App. 1984).

        Presumption is raised when defendants in quiet title suit to mining claim supported their contention that annual trips were made to the property and gold recovered therefrom by the facts that each fall one defendant returned from mining trip with gold, that defendants were seen from time to time on the property mining and prospecting, and that they made and filed affidavits of having done annual assessment work.

      <li id="t47c07s47-703Aol11">
       With the exception of casual exploration as defined in subsection (6)(a) of this section, prior to motorized exploration on state lands, an operator shall first submit to the director of the department of lands, an exploration and reclamation plan and a bond in such form as prescribed by the board. The bond shall be in an amount determined by the board to be the estimated reasonable costs to perform the reclamation activities described in the exploration and reclamation plan in the event of the failure of the operator to complete those activities, plus ten percent (10%) of such costs, and conditioned on the payment of all damages to the land and resources thereon caused by the motorized exploration. An operator shall also comply with the dredge and placer mining act [Idaho dredge and placer mining protection act], chapter 13, title 47, Idaho Code, and the surface mining act [Idaho mined land reclamation act], chapter 15, title 47, Idaho Code, where applicable. Written approval by the board is required prior to entry for motorized exploration.
      </li>

       Except as provided in this subsection, no bond for exploration reclamation submitted pursuant to this chapter shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for any given acre of affected land. The board may require a bond in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for any given acre of affected land only when the following conditions have been met:

         The board has conducted a hearing where the operator is allowed to give testimony to the board concerning the amount of the proposed bond. The hearing shall be held under such rules as promulgated by the board. This requirement for hearing may be waived, in writing, by the operator. Any hearing that is held shall, at the discretion of the director, extend the time up to thirty (30) days in which the board must act on a submitted plan.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t47c07s47-703Aol13">
       Weather permitting, the board shall deliver to the operator within sixty (60) days after the receipt of any exploration and reclamation plan a notice of rejection or notice of approval of said plan, as the case may be; provided, however, that if the board fails to deliver a notice of approval or notice of rejection within said time period, the plan submitted shall be deemed approved under subsection (1) of this section, and the operator may, upon furnishing a bond to the board that meets the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, commence and conduct his motorized exploration on the lands covered by such plan as if a notice of approval of said plan had been received from the board; provided, however, that if weather conditions prevent the board from inspecting the lands to obtain information needed to approve or reject a submitted plan, it may, in writing to the operator, extend the time not to exceed thirty (30) days after weather conditions permit such inspection. Any notice of rejection issued by the director of the department of lands or his properly authorized designated officer may be appealed by the operator to the board.

       When all reclamation activities described in the exploration and reclamation plan have been completed, the operator shall notify the board. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice, weather permitting, the board shall notify the operator as to whether or not the reclamation activities have been satisfactorily completed. Upon the determination by the board that the reclamation activities in question have been satisfactorily completed, the board shall release the bond. If weather conditions prevent the board from obtaining information needed to determine if the reclamation activities have been satisfactorily completed, it may, in writing to the operator, extend the time not to exceed thirty (30) days after weather conditions permit such inspection. Any notice issued by the director of the department of lands or his properly authorized designated officer to not release the bond may be appealed by the operator to the board.

         “Casual exploration” means entry and/or exploration which does not appreciably disturb or damage the land or resources thereon. Casual exploration includes, but is not limited to, geochemical and/or geophysical exploration techniques, sampling with hand tools, and entry using wheeled vehicles for transportation to conduct such exploration. Exploration using suction dredges having an intake diameter of two (2) inches or less shall be considered casual exploration when operated on endowment lands in a perennial stream. Exploration using suction dredges having an intake diameter of five (5) inches or less shall be considered casual exploration when operated in a navigable river. All suction dredging on state lands must follow the requirements of the stream protection act, chapter 38, title 42, Idaho Code.

        <li id="t47c07s47-703Aol16c">
         “Exploration and reclamation plan” means, for this section only, a written plan and maps with sufficient detail to accurately describe all of the activities associated with motorized exploration on state lands and the activities associated with reclamation. Reclamation activities may include, but are not limited to, regrading to resemble the original contour, plugging drill holes and revegetation. An estimate of third party reclamation costs, acceptable to the board, shall be included in the plan and will be used to determine the bond amount.

        This section was amended by two 1990 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1990 amendment, by ch. 316, § 2, in subsection (1) in the first sentence substituted “one dollar ($1.00)” for “twenty-five cents (25¢)”; in subsection (4) in the second sentence substituted “result when two (2) or more applications are received for the same lands during the same hour of the same day” for “will be resolved by a drawing within thirty (30) days thereafter” and added the present third and fourth sentences; in subsection (5) in the first sentence deleted “indicate the annual rental and royalty offered by him” following “describe the land,”; and in subsection (8) in the first and second sentences substituted “the director” for “he” following “who, if” and “proposed lease,” respectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1990 amendment, by ch. 317, § 2, in subsection (6) added “motorized” following “Any”, deleted “with heavy motorized equipment” following “exploration”, substituted “water marks” for “watermarks” preceding “of any navigable”, substituted “upon written approval” for “after award of a lease” following “prohibited except” and substituted “protection” for “channel alteration” following “with the stream”.
    The 2020 amendment, by ch. 341, in subsection (1), in the first sentence, substituted “tracts of sizes as the board may deem fair for prospecting, exploration, and mining of mineral deposits” for “tracts not exceeding six hundred forty (640) acres for prospecting and mining purposes, and mineral deposits” near the beginning, added “and not more than market conditions” at the end, and deleted the former last sentence, which read: “The rental period for any year shall be deducted from the royalties as they accrue for that year”; rewrote subsection (2), which formerly read: “All mineral leases, except leases for oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons, and geothermal resources of state school lands and for lands belonging to the state of Idaho, other than school lands, shall be for a term of ten (10) years, and so long thereafter as precious metals, minerals, salable minerals, and ores, or any of them, are produced in paying quantities, or as much longer thereafter as the lessee in good faith shall conduct mining operations thereon, together with the right to use and occupy so much of the surface of said land as may be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the prospecting for, exploration for, development of, production, refining, processing and marketing of said precious metals, minerals, salable minerals, and ores produced from said lands, including the right to construct and maintain thereon all works, buildings, plants, waterways, roads, communication lines, reservoirs, tanks or other structures necessary to the full enjoyment thereon for the purpose of the lease”; in subsection (4), deleted “subsection (5) of” preceding “this section” at the end of the fourth sentence; and added subsection (9).

      Should any one apply to lease for prospecting and mining purposes the mineral deposits belonging to the state upon which improvements have been made, before the lease shall issue, to other than the owner of the improvements thereon, the applicant shall pay to the owner thereof the value of said improvements and shall file in the office of the state board of land commissioners a receipt showing that the price of said improvements, as agreed upon by the parties or fixed by appraisement under authority of the said board, has been paid to the owner thereof in full, or shall make satisfactory proof that he has tendered to such owner the price of said improvements so agreed upon or fixed by appraisement. The word “improvements” within the meaning of this section and of section 47-706[, Idaho Code,] shall be construed to mean work performed in the development of the property, the estimated value of all known or probable mineral contained in the land that has been discovered or developed through mining excavations made by lessee, and all buildings, dwellings, mill machinery, mine machinery, trails, roads, and all equipment used, constructed and necessary for the operation of the mine, mill or plant.

If upon the hearing of such motion, and the affidavits and proofs offered by the respective parties, the judge shall be of the opinion that the plaintiff has made a prima facie case entitling him to the relief demanded in the complaint, or any part thereof, he shall appoint three commissioners, who must be disinterested persons, residents of the county, to assess the damages resulting to the claims, mines or lands of the defendant.

        When no effort was being made to enforce this act and no effort was contemplated unless it was first judicially determined that funds were available to pay the expense of administration or a legislative appropriation had been made for that purpose, an injunction would not lie to restrain the enforcement of such act and under such state of facts the constitutionality of such act should not have been passed upon.

       <p>
        This law, imposing a tax on mining, is not violative of Idaho Const., Art. III, § 1, since all occupations and trades are the legitimate subject for taxation and it makes no difference whether mining is called a “privilege” or a “right,” it is subject to taxation.

       </p>

        A tax on the business of mining was held not subject to the contention that it was a property or ad valorem tax, not an excise or income tax, hence, in effect, a double ad valorem tax, or, if an excise tax, violative of Idaho Const., Art. VII, § 5 as double taxation. Idaho Gold Dredging Co. v. Balderston, 58 Idaho 692, 78 P.2d 105 (1938).

        The legislature intended this act to tax the mining industry as an occupation on a net yearly output basis, as reported by the miner to the assessor, less certain defined deductions. Idaho Gold Dredging Co. v. Balderston, 58 Idaho 692, 78 P.2d 105 (1938). Title of Act.

       <p>
        A contention that the title of this act was insufficient because it did not specify that the proceeds of the tax went into the public school fund and because it failed to specify that a duplicate copy of the statement required under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.63.html#t63c28s63-2803" target="_blank">§ 63-2803 </a></cite>to be delivered to the commissioner of law enforcement was unconstitutional was held not good since the title advised that the body thereof fixed the distribution of the tax and the determination of its measure.

        This section was amended by two 1986 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1986 amendment, by ch, 73, § 6, in the second paragraph substituted “account” for “fund” preceding “created by section 63-3067, Idaho Code.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1986 amendment, by ch. 92, § 1, in the first paragraph added “63-3030A” following “income tax act” and “63-3069” preceding “63-3071” and “63-3072, 63-3073” following “63-3071”.

        Section 7 of S.L. 1977, ch. 93 provided: “(a) An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its passage and approval, and retroactive to January 1, 1977.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) If a taxpayer is filing a mine license tax return for a taxable year other than a taxpayer’s income tax taxable year, a change to conform the mine license tax taxable year to the income tax taxable year shall be made as follows: A mine license tax return shall be filed for a twelve (12) month period ending on the last day of the income tax taxable year ending in 1977. From the mine license tax computed for such period, credit may be taken for the tax, prorated on a monthly basis, attributable to the period beginning with the first day of the income tax taxable year commencing in 1976 and ending on the last day of the mine license tax taxable year ending in 1976.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Example: The income tax taxable year is a fiscal year ending June 30. The mine license tax taxable period is a calendar year. The mine license tax for 1976 is six hundred dollars ($600). The mine license tax for the twelve (12) month period ending June 30, 1977, computed on the return filed to conform to the income tax taxable year, is four hundred dollars ($400). The tax liability for the taxable year ending June 30, 1977 is one hundred dollars ($100), computed as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Tax computed for the twelve month period ending 6-30-77 ............................... $400
       </p>
       <p>
        “Less credit for 6/12 of $600 ...............................  $300
       </p>
       <p>
        “Tax due for taxable year ending
       </p>
       <p>
        6-30-77 ............................... $100
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Nothing herein shall be interpreted as a change in legislative intent with regard to the taxation of royalties, determination of value, definition of mining, or the definition of valuable mineral, including the definition of valuable mineral as including phosphate and limestone, but instead these provisions herein relating to these matters shall be interpreted as a clarification of existing law as previously enacted.” Approved March 17, 1977.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3 of S.L. 1982, ch. 179 declared an emergency and made the act effective retroactively to January 1, 1982. Approved March 23, 1982.

At the beginning of each calendar year or before operations begin, the operator shall notify the director of any increase or decrease in the acreage of disturbed lands which will result from planned placer mining activity within the next operating season. A correlated increase or decrease in the bond shall be required by the director for a change in disturbed acreage. In the event of failure by the permittee to reclaim disturbed lands in the permit area, the cost charged to the permittee shall be reasonable costs of reclamation plus ten percent (10%); provided that in no event shall any bond submitted pursuant to this section exceed one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1,800) for any given acre of disturbed land. The determination by the board of reclamation costs shall constitute a final decision subject to judicial review as set forth in subsection (d)[(c)] of section 47-1320, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Without in any manner affecting the penal and injunctive provisions of this act the Idaho state board of land commissioners is empowered to commence proceedings to terminate any permit to conduct dredge or other placer mining operations issued hereunder for any violation of the terms of this act, after having issued and served upon the permittee alleged to be committing such violation, a formal complaint which shall specify the provisions of this act which the permittee allegedly is violating, and a statement of the manner in and the extent to which said permittee is alleged to be violating the provisions of this act. Such notice may be served by certified mail, and return receipt signed by the permittee or his agent shall constitute service and time thereof of such notice. The permittee shall answer the complaint and request a hearing before a designated hearing officer within thirty (30) days from receipt of the complaint if matters asserted in the complaint are disputed. If the permittee fails to answer the complaint and to request a hearing, the matters asserted in the complaint shall be deemed admitted by the permittee, and the board may proceed to terminate the permit and forfeit the bond in an amount necessary to pay all costs and expense of restoring the lands and beds of streams damaged by dredge or other placer mining of the defaulting permittee. Upon request for a hearing by a permittee, the board shall schedule a hearing not less than thirty (30) days after the date the permittee requests a hearing. The provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, shall govern proceedings instituted pursuant to this section. The board may designate one (1) of its members, or a hearing officer or officers to conduct any hearings and enter recommended or preliminary orders, as determined by the board, on issues involving the administration of this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon entry of a final order terminating a permit or forfeiting a bond, the board shall assess the costs of the hearing against the defaulting permittee.

        Although the case was before the supreme court on appeal where it had been concluded that no right of appeal existed from the board of land commissioners under the Idaho dredge mining protection act to the supreme court, nevertheless for a proper and orderly disposition of the problem presented, the case would be considered as being before the court on certiorari.

        Where there was no valid provision for appeal from the order of the board of land commissioners in the Idaho dredge mining protection act and there was no other protection for the property right of the appellant, and the character of the duties and orders of the board of land commissioners and its duly designated hearing agent being judicial in nature, appellant under the act was without remedy to protect his constitutional rights and the order which revoked the dredge mining permit was null and void.

        That provision of the Idaho dredge mining protection act which provided for an appeal from the board of land commissioners directly to the supreme court was unconstitutional and void as being an attempt to evade judicial processes by legislation.

       The board may maintain an action in the name of the state of Idaho to enjoin any person from operating or maintaining a placer or dredge mining operation without holding a valid permit or bond as provided in this act or regulations promulgated thereto. The court, or a judge thereof at chambers, if satisfied from a complaint or by affidavits that the alleged acts have been or are being committed, may issue a temporary restraining order, without notice or bond, enjoining the defendant, his agents and employees, from operating or maintaining such placer or dredge mining operation without obtaining a permit and bond as provided in this act or regulations promulgated thereto. No showing of injury shall be required other than that this act is being violated by the operation or maintenance of a placer or dredge mining operation without the approved permit and bond. Upon a showing of good cause therefor, the court may require the defendant to undertake mitigation or restoration of the disturbed area in conformity with section 47-1314, Idaho Code, pending final disposition of the action. The action shall proceed as in other cases for injunctions. If at the trial the operation and maintenance of a placer or dredge mining operation without a permit or bond be established, and the court further finds that it is probable that the defendant will continue therein or in similar violations, the court shall enter a decree perpetually enjoining said defendant, his agents and employees from thereafter committing said or similar actions in violation of this act.

Such penalty shall be recoverable in an action brought in the name of the state of Idaho by the attorney general.

       Whenever the board determines that an operator has not complied with the provisions of this chapter, the board may notify the operator of such noncompliance and may, by private conference, conciliation, and persuasion, endeavor to remedy such violation. In the event of a violation referred to in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the board may proceed without an administrative action, hearing or decision to exercise the remedies set forth in said subsections. Additionally, no administrative action, hearing or decision shall be required from the Idaho board of environmental quality prior to the board proceeding under subsections (d) and (e) of this section. In the event of the failure of any conference, conciliation and persuasion to remedy any alleged violation, the board may cause to have issued and served upon the operator alleged to be committing such violation a formal complaint that shall specify the provisions of this chapter that the operator allegedly is violating and a statement of the manner in and the extent to which said operator is alleged to be violating the provisions of this chapter. Such complaint may be served by certified mail, and a return receipt signed by the operator, an officer of a corporate operator, or the designated agent of the operator shall constitute service. The operator shall answer the complaint and request a hearing before a designated hearing officer within thirty (30) days from receipt of the complaint if matters asserted in the complaint are disputed. If the operator fails to answer the complaint and request a hearing, the matters asserted in the complaint shall be deemed admitted by the operator, and the board may proceed to cancel the reclamation or permanent closure plan and forfeit the financial assurance in the amount necessary to reclaim affected lands or complete the permanent closure activities. Upon request for a hearing by an operator, the board shall schedule a hearing before a hearing officer appointed by the board at a time not less than thirty (30) days after the date the operator requests a hearing. The board shall issue subpoenas at the request of the director of the department of lands and at the request of the charged operator, and the matter shall be otherwise handled and conducted in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. The hearing officer shall, pursuant to said hearing, enter an order in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, which, if adverse to the operator, shall designate a time period within which corrective action should be taken. The time period designated shall be long enough to allow the operator, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, to rectify any failure to comply designated in said order. In the event that the operator takes such action as is necessary to comply with the order within the time period designated in said order, no further action shall be taken by the board to compel performance under the chapter.

       The forfeiture of such financial assurance shall fully satisfy all obligations of the operator to reclaim the affected land or complete permanent closure activities under the provisions of this chapter.

Nothing in this subsection shall relieve the operator of any obligation, including the obligation to complete closure requirements, pursuant to a permit issued by the department of environmental quality under section 39-118A, Idaho Code, or limit that department’s authority to require compliance with such permit requirements.

The court, or a judge thereof at chambers, if satisfied from the complaint or by affidavits that such acts have been or are being committed, shall issue a temporary restraining order without notice or bond, enjoining the defendant, his agents, and employees from conducting such operations without said plan or bond. Upon a showing of good cause therefor, the temporary restraining order may require the defendant to perform reclamation of the mined area in conformity with sections 47-1509 and 47-1510, Idaho Code, or to complete permanent closure activities, pending final disposition of the action. The action shall then proceed as in other cases for injunctions. If it is established at trial that the defendant has operated without an approved plan or financial assurance, the court shall enter, in addition to any other order, a decree enjoining the defendant, his agents and employees from thereafter conducting such activities or similar actions in violation of this chapter. The board may, in conjunction with its injunctive procedures, proceed in the same or in a separate action to recover from an operator who is conducting mining or exploration operations or operating a cyanidation facility without the required plan or financial assurance, the cost of performing the reclamation activities required by sections 47-1509 and 47-1510, Idaho Code, or the cost of permanent closure activities from any such operator who has not provided financial assurance to cover the cost of the required activities.

        This section was amended by two 2005 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2005 amendment, by ch. 167, substituted “this chapter” for “this act” throughout the section; in subsection (a) inserted “or permanent closure” and “or complete the permanent closure activities” in the seventh sentence; in subsection (c), inserted “or complete permanent closure activities,” in the first sentence, inserted “or the original approved permanent closure plan” in the second sentence, and added the last sentence; in subsection (d), inserted “or to complete permanent closure activities” near the end of the second sentence and inserted “or operating a cyanidation facility” and “or the cost of permanent closure activities” in the last sentence; in subsection (e), inserted “or cyanidation facility” near the middle of the sentence; and added subsections (i) and (j).
    The 2005 amendment, by ch. 341, added “cyanidation closure fund” at the end of the catchline, substituted “this chapter” for “this act” throughout the section and, in subsection (f), designated the former last sentence as paragraph (1) and added paragraphs (2) and (3).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 amendment, by ch. 37, deleted former subsection (f)(3) which read: “Any unencumbered and unexpended balances in the surface mining reclamation fund and the cyanidation facility closure fund remaining at the end of a fiscal year shall not lapse but shall be carried forward until expended or modified by subsequent statute”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 226, substituted “financial assurance” for “bond” in the section heading and throughout the section; deleted “surface” preceding “mining” in the last sentence of subsection (d) and near the middle of subsection (e); in subsection (h), substituted “July 1, 2019” for “January 1, 1997” in the first sentence, and deleted the last two sentences, which formerly read: “However, the board may periodically review, and revise if necessary to meet the requirements of sections 47-1506, 47-1509, 47-1510 and 47-1511, Idaho Code, the amount, terms and conditions of any bond when there is a material change in the reclamation plan or a material change in the estimated reasonable costs of reclamation determined pursuant to section 47-1512, Idaho Code. Any revision to the amount, terms and conditions of a bond due to a material change in the reclamation plan shall apply only to the affected lands covered by the material change in the reclamation plan”; and deleted subsections (i) and (j), which concerned approval of permits for cyanidation facilities and permanent closure plans for the facilities.

      For the purposes of this chapter, “geothermal resources” shall mean the natural heat energy of the earth, the energy, in whatever form, which may be found in any position and at any depth below the surface of the earth present in, resulting from, or created by, or which may be extracted from, such natural heat, and all minerals in solution or other products obtained from the material medium of any geothermal resource. Geothermal resources are found and hereby declared to be sui generis, being neither a mineral resource nor a water resource, but they are also found and hereby declared to be closely related to and possibly affecting and affected by water resources in many instances. No right to seek, obtain, or use geothermal resources has passed or shall pass with any existing or future lease of state or school lands, including but not limited to, mineral leases and leases issued under chapter 8, title 47, Idaho Code.
