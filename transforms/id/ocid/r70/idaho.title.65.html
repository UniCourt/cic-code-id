        This section was amended by two 2001 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2001 amendment, by ch. 198, § 1, rewrote the first paragraph which read: “The administrator of the division of veterans services shall have full power and authority on behalf of the state of Idaho, in recognition of the services rendered by disabled or destitute servicemen and servicewomen honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States, to oversee the management and operation of the veterans homes in the state, and provide such care and extend such financial relief and assistance to said disabled or destitute, honorably discharged servicemen and servicewomen and to those dependent upon such honorably discharged, disabled or destitute servicemen and servicewomen as the commission shall determine to be reasonably required by such disabled or destitute servicemen and servicewomen and their dependents under such rules as the administrator may, from time to time adopt; and said administrator shall have power and authority to render such financial assistance to any person honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States, regardless of the period during which he or she shall have served; provided, however, that no financial aid or direct relief shall be granted to any discharged person unless he or she shall have served during one (1) of the periods hereinafter referred to and shall come under the definition of veteran set out in section 65-203, Idaho Code” and at the end of the second paragraph, substituted “the division of veterans services” for “veterans homes.”

        The 2001 amendment, by ch. 199, § 2, divided the present first sentence into two sentences, in the present first sentence, substituted “veterans of the armed forces of the United States” for “disabled or destitute servicemen and servicewomen honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States”, also in the first sentence, inserted “and the state veterans cemetery” following “veterans homes in the state”, substituted “and provide such care to veterans of the armed forces of the United States” and added the present second sentence which reads: “Further, the administrator shall extend financial relief and assistance to disabled or destitute wartime veterans and to those dependent upon such wartime veterans as the commission shall determine to be reasonably required” for “and provide such care and extend such financial relief and assistance to said disabled or destitute, honorably discharged servicemen and servicewomen and those dependent upon such honorably discharged, disabled or destitute servicemen and servicewomen as the commission shall determine to be reasonably required”, deleted “by such disabled or destitute servicemen and servicewomen and their dependents under such rules as the administrator may, from time to time adopt; and said administrator shall have power and authority to render such financial assistance to any person honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States, regardless of the period during which he or she shall have served; provided, however, that no financial aid or direct relief shall be granted to any discharged person unless he or she shall have served during one (1) of the periods hereinafter referred to and shall come under the definition of veteran set out in section 65-203, Idaho Code”, added the last sentence and in the second paragraph inserted “the division of” preceding “veterans” and substituted “services” for “homes” following “veterans.”
    This section was amended by two 2002 acts which appear to be in conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2002 amendment, by ch. 49, § 3, divided the section into seven paragraphs and added the subsection designations; at the end of subsection (1) substituted “under such rules as the administrator may from time to time adopt” for “Further, the administrator shall”; at the end of subsection (2) deleted “The administrator is further authorized to”; in the middle of subsection (3) added “the administrator is hereby”; rewrote subsection (4), which formerly read: “With the approval of the commission, the administrator may prescribe the qualifications of all personnel on a nonpartisan merit basis in accordance with the Idaho personnel system law for employment of personnel in the division of veterans services”; added subsections (5) through (7); and made related changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2002 amendment, by ch. 54, § 1, added the second sentence in present subsection (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was amended by two 2003 acts which appear to be compatible and have been compiled together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2003 amendment, by ch. 42, § 2, added subsection (8).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2003 amendment, by ch. 53, § 2, also added subsection (8), which was temporarily redesignated as [(9)] (8). The redesignation was made permanent by S.L. 2004, ch. 318, § 13.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2007 amendment, by ch. 16, inserted “and the state veterans cemetery,” following “advocacy” in subsection (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 amendment, by ch. 10, added subsection (10).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2018 amendment, by ch. 66, substituted “a state veterans cemetery” for “the state veterans cemetery” throughout subsections (3), (8), and (9) and substituted “and state veterans cemeteries” for “and the state veterans cemetery” in subsections (1) and (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 amendment, by ch. 154, substituted “destitute veterans” for “disabled or destitute wartime veterans” twice in subsection (2).

     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature to honor veterans of the armed forces by providing preference in initial appointments to public sector jobs in Idaho. Veterans’ preference is intended to honor those citizens who have served their country in active duty by providing veterans a more favorable competitive position for government employment and acknowledging the larger sacrifice of disabled veterans. Eligible veterans are provided advantages in public employment in Idaho, including preference for initial employment and retention in the event of layoffs. Veterans’ preference requires public employers to provide additional consideration for eligible veterans, but it does not guarantee the veteran a job.

        The 2011 amendment, by ch. 284, added subsections (1), (3), and (10), redesignating the other subsections and updating the internal references; substituted “veterans separated under honorable conditions” for “honorably separated veterans” in the introductory paragraph of subsection (4); rewrote the introductory paragraph in present subsection (7), adding paragraphs (a) to (d); substituted “civil service position” for “classified position as determined on the basis of examination and merit factors as established in a civil service system” in present subsection (14); added, “been discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions and has” at the end of the introductory paragraph in subsection (17); and updated the federal reference in paragraph (17)(d).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 188, rewrote subsection (17), which formerly read: “Veteran’ means any person who has been discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions and has (a) Served on active duty in the armed forces during a war, in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or during the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955; (b) Served on active duty as defined in 38 U.S.C. section 101(21) at any time in the armed forces for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976, not including service under 10 U.S.C. section 12103(d) pursuant to an enlistment in the army national guard or the air national guard or as a reserve for service in the army reserve, naval reserve, air force reserve, marine corps reserve or coast guard reserve; (c) Served on active duty as defined in 38 U.S.C. section 101(21) in the armed forces during the period beginning on August 2, 1990, and ending on January 2, 1992; or (d) Served as may be further defined in 5 U.S.C. section 2108.”
    The 2020 amendment, by ch. 44, deleted former subsection (17), which read: “Veteran’ means any person who has been discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions provided they have served on active duty for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. As used in this subsection and chapter,” “active duty ” means full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. Such term includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the secretary of the military department concerned.”

         Public employers must give notice in all announcements and advertisements of vacancies that preference in appointment will be given to preference applicants. Application forms must inquire whether the applicant is claiming veterans’ preference and whether the applicant has previously claimed such a preference. An applicant claiming preference is responsible for providing required documentation at the time of making application. The employer must inform applicants of the requirements for documentation.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c05s65-503Aol12">
         In all public employment, excluding key employee positions, the hiring official shall give preference to preference eligible applicants.

         An application for appointment to a position will be accepted after the closing date of the examination from an applicant who was serving in the armed forces, or undergoing service-connected hospitalization up to one (1) year following discharge. The application must be submitted within one hundred twenty (120) days of the applicant’s separation from the armed forces or hospitalization, prior to the expiration of any register established as a result of the examination, and prior to the selection for the position.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c05s65-503Aol14">
         A disabled veteran may file an application at any time up until a selection has been made for any position for which a register is then maintained as a source for future job openings, or for which a register is about to be established, provided he or she has not already been examined twice for the same position and grade for which application is made, does not have current eligibility on that register, or is not serving in a competitive position in the same grade for which application is made. If a register is not used as a part of the selection process, a disabled veteran may file an application after the closing date, but such application will only be considered if a selection has not been made and the selection process is still active.

         An appointing authority may refuse to accept an application from an otherwise qualified preference eligible applicant who is deemed unqualified through his or her actions. Examples of such actions include dismissal for cause from a public entity, a felony conviction, or conduct unbecoming a public employee. Such refusal must be supported by good cause and is appealable pursuant to section 65-506, Idaho Code.
