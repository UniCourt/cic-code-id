        <p class="">
    History of Irrigation Law. Two acts passed in 1881 were the basis of the irrigation law of the state for a number of years. The act of Feb. 10, 1881 (Laws 1881, p. 267) regulated the appropriation of water, requiring the posting of notices at the point of diversion and the recording of the same as in the case of mining claims, and prescribing the manner of procuring rights of way by proceedings before the county commissioners. The act of Feb. 7 (Laws 1881, p. 273) regulated the distribution of water through watermasters whose election and duties were therein provided for. The provisions of these two acts were substantially perpetuated in R.S.,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.3155.html#t3155c32s3155-3205" target="_blank">§§ 3155-3205</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new act covering the appropriation of water and providing for fixing water rates by the district court was enacted in 1895 (Laws 1895, p. 174). This act was in part reenacted and in part repealed by the act of Feb. 25, 1899 (Laws 1899, p. 380) which added several new provisions to the law and gave to the county commissioners jurisdiction to fix water rates. The appropriation provisions of the 1899 law were repealed by Laws 1903, p. 223, which, for the first time, departed from the old system of posting and recording notices of appropriation, placing the matter in the hands of the state engineer. The act of 1903, with such sections of the 1899 and earlier laws as are still in force, comprise the basis of this title, which has been frequently amended since the enactment of the R.C.

    Compiler’s notes. S.L. 1919, ch. 8, § 38, p. 65 (§ 67-3401 herein) abolished the office of state engineer, and § 37 of the same act (§ 67-3301 herein) vested his powers and duties in the department of reclamation. The substitutions of offices and officials authorized by that act have been made accordingly, the text of the preexisting law not being changed except insofar as necessary in making substitutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        S.L. 1970, ch. 12, § 2, p. 21 (§ 42-1801a herein) substituted the department of water administration for the department of reclamation. In 1974 such act was amended by 1974, ch. 20, § 28, p. 533 wherein the department of water resources was substituted for the department of water administration.

       <p>
        To perfect an adverse claim for water ripening into title, claimant must show that his use of the water deprived the prior appropriators of water at times when such prior appropriators actually needed the water; the use does not become adverse until it interferes with the use thereof by the prior appropriators, and therefore proof merely that claimant used water and claimed the right to use it is no proof whatever of adverse use. Head v. Merrick, 69 Idaho 106, 203 P.2d 608 (1949). Appropriation of Water.
       </p>
       <p>
        If one appropriates water for beneficial use, and then sells, rents, or distributes it to others who apply it to such beneficial use, he has a valuable right which is entitled to protection as property right. Murray v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 27 Idaho 603, 150 P. 47 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section indicates that water is subject to appropriation only when flowing in its natural channel. Rabido v. Furey, 33 Idaho 56, 190 P. 73 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Spring situated wholly on government homestead entry is source from which valid water appropriation may be made, with entryman’s consent. Short v. Praisewater, 35 Idaho 691, 208 P. 844 (1922); Keiler v. McDonald, 37 Idaho 573, 218 P. 365 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an appropriator diverted and applied water on his own land to a beneficial use without the initiation of the right in trespass, and diverted the water, continuously and uninterruptedly, for such beneficial use, his right by virtue of appropriation was complete. Jones v. McIntire, 60 Idaho 338, 91 P.2d 373 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where village duly appropriated to its beneficial use all water, which was public, from certain springs, and no other persons had ever appropriated this water to beneficial use, village acquired right to use all the water from these springs. Village of Peck v. Denison, 92 Idaho 747, 450 P.2d 310 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an owner of land diverted water from a spring on the land and applied it to a beneficial use, the appropriation was valid when made, and the water right thus perfected was appurtenant to the land which received the benefit of the water and thus passed on to the person who acquired title to the benefited land. Parke v. Bell, 97 Idaho 67, 539 P.2d 995 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Diversion is a prerequisite to appropriation of water, along with the application of such water to a beneficial use. Hidden Springs Trout Ranch, Inc. v. Hagerman Water Users, Inc., 101 Idaho 677, 619 P.2d 1130 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the prior appropriation doctrine gives pre-eminent rights to those who put water to beneficial use first in time, this is not an absolute rule without exception. The Idaho Constitution and statutes do not permit waste and require water to be put to beneficial use or be lost. Rangen, Inc. v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Res. (In re Distrib. of Water to Water Right Nos. 36-02551 &amp; 36-07694), 160 Idaho 119, 369 P.3d 897 (2016).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the water right of the upstream appropriator with a valid permit was junior to that of the downstream appropriator with constitutional water rights, and the former’s impoundment of water interfered with the latter’s senior entitlement, the upstream appropriator was liable for any damages caused by the wrongful interference.

        An appropriator, whose right is based upon a valid, although unadjudicated, constitutional method of appropriation, retains a senior claim in relation to a person holding a later issued permit. R.T. Nahas Co. v. Hulet, 114 Idaho 23, 752 P.2d 625 (Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly determined that United States had not asserted its water rights under the constitutional method of appropriation because, under that method the United States, as the claimant, was required to put the water to beneficial use, which it had failed to do. On the other hand, a livestock company had established its rights to the instream water because the company’s predecessors, by watering their stock, had put the water to beneficial use. Joyce Livestock Co. v. United States (In re SRBA Case No. 39576), 144 Idaho 1, 156 P.3d 502, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 990, 128 S. Ct. 487, 169 L. Ed. 2d 339 (2007).

        Evidence in the cited case supported a finding that the owners of an irrigation ditch, who had diverted water from a certain creek for many years, had established a right thereto by actual diversion and use. Bachman v. Reynolds Irrigation Dist., 56 Idaho 507, 55 P.2d 1314 (1936).

       <p>

        Where the water right of the upstream appropriator with a valid permit was junior to that of the downstream appropriator with constitutional water rights, and the former’s impoundment of water interfered with the latter’s senior entitlement, the upstream appropriator was liable for any damages caused by the wrongful interference.

        Since Idaho Const., Art. XV, § 3 and §§ 42-101, 42-103, 42-104 and 42-106, specifies the law of prior appropriation as the method to establish the right to use water in Idaho, absent a clear statutory expression by the legislature to create an exception to the appropriation statutes, all rights to the use of water in Idaho must be acquired by appropriation and the language in §§ 67-4401 and 67-4403 is not a clear expression that the legislature intended to create an exception from the appropriation process for the waters at Lava Hot Springs as the most reasonable interpretation of this language is that the foundation’s jurisdiction and control over waters at Lava Hot Springs refers to those waters that have already been appropriated or that will be appropriated in the future.

      Any person, entitled to the use of water whether represented by a license issued by the department of water resources, or by decree of the court, who shall desire to lease the water pursuant to section 42-108A, Idaho Code, shall make application to the department of water resources. Such application shall be upon forms furnished by the department and shall describe the right licensed, claimed or decreed which is to be leased. Upon receipt of said application, an application filing fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) and a publication fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), it shall be the duty of the director of the department of water resources to examine same and if otherwise proper, to cause notice of the proposed leasing of water and setting forth the hearing date at which protests will be heard, to be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper published and of general circulation within the county where the water is diverted, if there is such a paper, otherwise in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. Such notice shall advise that anyone who desires to protest the proposed leasing of water and who has a superior right to use the water and who may suffer pecuniary loss shall file notice of protest with the department within five (5) days of the last date of publication. The hearing date set by the director of the department of water resources shall be held not sooner than ten (10) nor later than fifteen (15) days after the last date of publication. Upon receipt of any protest, it shall be the duty of the director of the department of water resources to investigate the same and to conduct a hearing thereon. He shall also advise the watermaster of the district in which such water is used of the proposed lease.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director of the department of water resources shall examine all of the evidence and available information and, provided no other water rights senior or junior to the water to be leased are injured thereby, may reject and refuse approval for, or may partially approve for less quantity of water, or may approve upon conditions any proposed lease of water where the proposed use is such that it will reduce the quantity of water available under other existing water rights, the water supply involved is insufficient for the purpose for which it is sought, the lease would cause the use of water to be enlarged beyond that authorized under the water right to be leased, the lease would be contrary to any local rental pool procedure as authorized under section 42-1765, Idaho Code, the lease will conflict with the local public interest as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, or the lease will adversely affect the local economy of the watershed or local area within which the source of water for the proposed use originates, in the case where the place of use is outside of the watershed or local area where the source of water originates. A copy of the approved application for leasing of water shall be returned to the applicant, and he shall be authorized upon receipt thereof to lease the water pursuant to section 42-108A, Idaho Code. In the event the director of the department of water resources determines that a proposed change shall not be approved as provided in this section, he shall deny same and forward a notice of such action to the applicant by certified mail, which decision shall be subject to review pursuant to section 42-1701A, Idaho Code.
    All fees received by the department of water resources under the provisions of this section shall be submitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the water administration fund [account].

       A permit may be issued, but shall not be required for appropriation of water for the in-stream watering of livestock. In the consideration of applications for permits to appropriate water for other purposes, the director of the department of water resources shall impose such reasonable conditions as are necessary to protect prior downstream water rights for in-stream livestock use, and in the administration of the water rights on any stream, the director, and the district court where applicable, shall recognize and protect water rights for in-stream livestock use, according to priority, as they do water rights for other purposes. As used in this section, the phrase “in-stream watering of livestock” means the drinking of water by livestock directly from a natural stream, without the use of any constructed physical diversion works.

Upon such petition, the director shall cause an investigation to be made and may hold hearings or gather information in other ways.

Upon such a petition, the director shall cause an investigation to be made and may hold hearings or gather information in some other manner.

The incidental hydropower use shall be junior to and fully subordinated to all existing and future uses and shall be nonconsumptive. To qualify for this exemption, the person or entity must give written notice to the department of water resources and the watermaster describing the hydropower use, location and capacity of the project upon completion of the project. The notice must include a copy of the order or document authorizing the project. The notice must also certify that the incidental use of water for hydropower purposes under the existing water right meets all the requirements of this subsection.

        The federal power act does preempt some state laws relating to the building of dams on navigable streams and it particularly preempts those state laws which require a state license as a predicate for building a dam; however, state law regarding proprietary rights in water is expressly saved. Idaho Power Co. v. State, 104 Idaho 575, 661 P.2d 741 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is nothing in the law of Idaho which precludes a person from voluntarily obtaining less than the full panoply of rights associated with the ownership of real property and a voluntary subordination agreement is not in violation of Idaho’s water law. Therefore there was no conflict between state water law and the language of the subordination clause inserted in the licenses issued by federal power commission to power company in connection with the Hells Canyon hydroelectric project. Idaho Power Co. v. State, 104 Idaho 575, 661 P.2d 741 (1983).

        Where the United States bureau of reclamation (BOR) filed water right claims against irrigation entities regarding projects developed pursuant to the Reclamation Act of 1902, any rights held by BOR were subject to rights of the beneficial users that were served by the irrigation districts because, inter alia, (1) federal law deferred to state law in determining the rights to water in the reclamation projects, (2) the beneficial users had an interest that was stronger than mere contractual expectancy, and (3) title to the use of the water was held by the consumers or users of the water.

        One may obtain prior right to use of water of stream where he actually diverts and applies the same to a beneficial use, although he may never have applied to state engineer for permit to do so.

        Water may be appropriated without compliance with the steps provided by the statute; but in such case it requires actual application to a beneficial use to complete the appropriation and the right is limited to the amount so applied, with date of priority determined by such application to beneficial use.

        Trial court properly determined that United States had not asserted its water rights under the constitutional method of appropriation because, under that method, the United States, as the claimant, was required to put the water to beneficial use, which it had failed to do. On the other hand, a livestock company had established its water rights because the company’s predecessors had put the water to beneficial use by watering their stock. Joyce Livestock Co. v. United States (In re SRBA Case No. 39576), 144 Idaho 1, 156 P.3d 502, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 990, 128 S. Ct. 487, 169 L. Ed. 2d 339 (2007). Protection of Right.

        Where the water right of the upstream appropriator with a valid permit was junior to that of the downstream appropriator with constitutional water rights, and the former’s impoundment of water interfered with the latter’s senior entitlement, the upstream appropriator was liable for any damages caused by the wrongful interference.

The director may, however, give notice of an application as he determines appropriate and may grant a temporary approval upon completion of the application form, payment of the filing fee, a determination by the director that the temporary approval can be properly administered, a determination that other sources of water are not available, a determination that approval is in the public interest and a determination that the temporary approval will not injure public values associated with the water source or any other water right. If the temporary approval is within a water district, the director shall seek and consider the recommendations of the watermaster before granting a temporary approval. The director may issue a temporary approval with the conditions determined by the director to be necessary to protect other water rights and the public interest.

       “Consumptive use” means that portion of the annual volume of water diverted under a water right that is transpired by growing vegetation, evaporated from soils, converted to nonrecoverable water vapor, incorporated into products, or otherwise does not return to the waters of the state. Consumptive use is not an element of a water right. Consumptive use does not include any water that falls as precipitation directly on the place of use. Precipitation shall not be considered to reduce the consumptive use of a water right. “Authorized consumptive use” means the maximum consumptive use that may be made of a water right. If the use of a water right is for irrigation, for example, the authorized consumptive use reflects irrigation of the most consumptive vegetation that may be grown at the place of use. Changes in consumptive use do not require a transfer pursuant to section 42-222, Idaho Code.

      <li id="t42c02s42-202Bol18">
       “Reasonably anticipated future needs” refers to future uses of water by a municipal provider for municipal purposes within a service area which, on the basis of population and other planning data, are reasonably expected to be required within the planning horizon of each municipality within the service area not inconsistent with comprehensive land use plans approved by each municipality. Reasonably anticipated future needs shall not include uses of water within areas overlapped by conflicting comprehensive land use plans.
    (9) “Service area” means that area within which a municipal provider is or becomes entitled or obligated to provide water for municipal purposes. For a municipality, the service area shall correspond to its corporate limits, or other recognized boundaries, including changes therein after the permit or license is issued. The service area for a municipality may also include areas outside its corporate limits, or other recognized boundaries, that are within the municipality’s established planning area if the constructed delivery system for the area shares a common water distribution system with lands located within the corporate limits. For a municipal provider that is not a municipality, the service area shall correspond to the area that it is authorized or obligated to serve, including changes therein after the permit or license is issued.

In all applications whether protested or not protested, where the proposed use is such: (a) that it will reduce the quantity of water under existing water rights, or (b) that the water supply itself is insufficient for the purpose for which it is sought to be appropriated, or (c) where it appears to the satisfaction of the director that such application is not made in good faith, is made for delay or speculative purposes, or (d) that the applicant has not sufficient financial resources with which to complete the work involved therein, or (e) that it will conflict with the local public interest as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, or (f) that it is contrary to conservation of water resources within the state of Idaho, or (g) that it will adversely affect the local economy of the watershed or local area within which the source of water for the proposed use originates, in the case where the place of use is outside of the watershed or local area where the source of water originates; the director of the department of water resources may reject such application and refuse issuance of a permit therefor, or may partially approve and grant a permit for a smaller quantity of water than applied for, or may grant a permit upon conditions. Provided however, that minimum stream flow water rights may not be established under the local public interest criterion, and may only be established pursuant to chapter 15, title 42, Idaho Code. The provisions of this section shall apply to any boundary stream between this and any other state in all cases where the water sought to be appropriated has its source largely within the state, irrespective of the location of any proposed power generating plant.

       </p>
       <p>
        Even if some provisions of the 1935 amendment to this section were unconstitutional, the district court should not have dismissed the action, but should have proceeded under the prior valid statute and such portion of the amendment as could be held valid, and such a proceeding would not be an action for a declaratory judgment, and the court could not pass upon the question of unconstitutionality until presented in a cause demanding rulings thereon.

        The design plan for a proposed facility depends on the nature of the facility, the complexity of the proposal, and the extent of the proposed appropriation’s impact on the local area; the plans should be sufficient to generally apprise the public of the efficacy of the proposed use in the planned facility, and of its potential impact.

        The legislature in this section must have intended the public interest on the local scale to include the public interest elements listed in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t42c15s42-1501" target="_self">§ 42-1501</a></cite>, as well as assuring minimum stream flows, discouraging waste and encouraging conservation. The relevant elements of public interest and their relative weights will vary with local needs, circumstances and interests. Shokal v. Dunn, 109 Idaho 330, 707 P.2d 441 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the burden of production as to which elements of public interest are impacted and to what degree lies with the party that has knowledge peculiar to himself, the burden of proof in all cases as to where the public interest lies rests with the applicant for a permit to appropriate water. Shokal v. Dunn, 109 Idaho 330, 707 P.2d 441 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of what elements of the public interest are impacted, and what the public interest requires, is committed to the department of water resources’ sound discretion. Shokal v. Dunn, 109 Idaho 330, 707 P.2d 441 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attaching nine conditions to the approved water permit was within the authority granted the department of water resources by the legislature. When the legislature enacted subsection (5) of this section, it clearly vested in the director of the department considerable authority and discretion to determine and protect the “local public interest” when issuing or rejecting water permits. Collins Bros. Corp. v. Dunn, 114 Idaho 600, 759 P.2d 891 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The director correctly found that the transfer of water right to land not previously covered by the right did not conflict with the local public interest, even though a local road had been flooded on several occasions by the water appropriated under the water right. Dovel v. Dobson, 122 Idaho 59, 831 P.2d 527 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, any application to appropriate water in Idaho is subject to the local public interest standard. Likewise, any change to a water right under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t42c02s42-222" target="_self">§ 42-222 </a></cite>is also subject to a determination that the change is in the local public interest as stated in this section; as is an amendment to a water permit under<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t42c02s42-211" target="_self">§ 42-211</a></cite>.

       <p>
        It was not improper to apply the new local public interest standard imposed by the 1978 amendment to an application for a water appropriation permit filed prior to the amendment, since a permit applicant applying to appropriate water has no prior individually vested right to the water at the time of the application in that it does not already own the water and since impermissible retroactive legislation is only that legislation which affects vested or preexisting rights.

       </p>
       <p>
        The filing of an application for a water appropriation permit establishes the priority date of the appropriation under the relation back doctrine, but any such priority date right is nonetheless contingent upon future statutory adherence and issuance of a license pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t42c02s42-219" target="_self">§ 42-219 </a></cite>and is therefore not a vested right which would preclude application of<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t42c02s42-203" target="_self">§ 42-203 </a></cite>(now this section), as amended in 1978, to a permit application filed prior to that amendment.

        Where the Box Canyon area was designated by the bureau of land management as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), and where the values justifying the ACEC designation included the identification of four candidate threatened and endangered aquatic species and the scenic and unique natural qualities of the area, the protection of this habitat fell within the local public interest as defined in
    Shokal v. Dunn
    , 109 Idaho 330, 770 P.2d 441 (1985); therefore, the protestants, although having no water rights within Box Canyon, sought to protect these locally important factors and thus their interests were properly considered by the director of the Idaho department of water resources.

       On receipt of the application, which shall be of a form prescribed by the department of water resources, it shall be the duty of that department to make an endorsement thereon of the date of its receipt and to examine said application and ascertain if it sets forth all the facts necessary to show the location, nature and amount of the proposed use. If upon such examination the application is found defective, it shall be the duty of the department of water resources to return the same for correction or to correspond with the applicant to obtain the needed information or amendments. If the application is returned to the applicant or the department shall request additional information and the applicant fails to return the corrected application or to supply the needed information within thirty (30) days, the department may void the record of said application and notify the applicant of such action. If the corrected application is returned or the information is supplied after thirty (30) days, such corrected application shall be treated in all respects as a new application, and the priority of the right initiated shall be determined by the date of receipt in the office of the department of the corrected application or additional information; provided, that upon request, and good cause appearing therefor, the director of the department of water resources may grant an extension of time within which to return the corrected application or supply needed information. All applications that comply with the provisions of this chapter and with the regulations of the department of water resources shall be numbered in such manner as will aid in their identification, and it shall be the duty of the department to approve all applications made in proper form that contemplate the application of water to a beneficial use: provided, that the department may deny any such application, or may partially approve and grant a permit for a lesser quantity of water than applied for, or may grant a permit upon conditions as provided in this chapter.

       The department of water resources shall issue a permit for any approved application, make a record of the approval and provide a copy of the permit to the applicant, who shall be authorized, on receipt thereof, to proceed with the construction of the necessary works for the diversion of such water and to take all steps required to apply the water to a beneficial use and perfect the proposed appropriation.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-204ol13">
       The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to permits held by municipal providers for reasonably anticipated future needs. For all other permits, the department shall require that actual construction work and application of the water to full beneficial use shall be complete within a period of five (5) years from the date of such approval, but may limit permit development to a shorter period than requested in the application, and the permit shall set forth the date when beneficial application of the water to be diverted by such works shall be made. Sixty (60) days before the date set for the completion of the appropriation of water under any permit, the department shall forward a notice to the permit holder by certified mail at the permit holder’s address of record of the date for such completion, which said notice shall advise the permit holder of the necessity of submitting a statement of completion showing proof of beneficial use or a request for an extension of time on or before said date. The department may approve a timely request for an extension of time in the following circumstances:
    (a) In cases where the permit holder is prevented from proceeding with construction, work, or application of water to full beneficial use by the permit holder’s failure to obtain necessary consent or final approval or rejection from the federal government because of the pendency of an application for right-of-way or other matter within the jurisdiction of the United States, by state, county, city or other local government permitting or administrative action or process related to the permit holder’s land or water development, or by litigation of any nature which might bring the permit holder’s title to said water in question, the department of water resources, upon proper showing of the existence of any such condition, and being convinced that said permit holder is proceeding diligently and in good faith, shall extend the time so that the amount of time lost by such delays shall be added to the time given in the original permit, or in any subsequent grant of extension pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (f) of this subsection, for each and every action required.

       For permits held by municipal providers for reasonably anticipated future needs, the permit development period shall correspond to the planning horizon authorized by the permit, which may not be extended. During the permit development period, the municipal provider shall periodically submit to the department incremental statements of completion showing proof of beneficial use consistent with the provisions of section 42-217, Idaho Code. Each such incremental statement shall document the extent of application of water to beneficial use during the most recent reporting interval. Each incremental statement shall be prepared by a certified water rights examiner, unless the permit holder is not asserting any additional increment of beneficial use during that reporting interval. The department shall set and may later adjust the duration of any reporting interval for any permit, which shall be made a condition of the permit, to any duration not shorter than five (5) years. Sixty (60) days before the end of each reporting interval, the department shall forward a notice to the municipal provider by certified mail to its address of record specifying the date the incremental statement is due. Unless an extension of the deadline for the incremental statement is requested by the municipal provider prior to the deadline, and the extension is approved by the director upon a showing of good cause, failure to timely submit an incremental statement shall result in a lapse of that portion of the permit that has not previously been licensed or for which an incremental statement of completion showing proof of beneficial use has not been submitted. Such lapsed permit portion may be reinstated only in accordance with the provisions of section 42-218a, Idaho Code.

      Whenever a permit has been issued pursuant to the provisions of this act, and the permit holder desires to change the place, period, or nature of the intended use, or make other substantial changes in the method of diversion or proposed use or uses of the water, he shall file an application for amendment upon forms to be furnished by the department of water resources together with the statutory fee for filing and recording same, and upon receipt thereof it shall be the duty of the department of water resources to examine same and if approval thereof would not result in the diversion and use of more water than originally permitted and if the rights of others will not be adversely affected thereby, the director of the department of water resources shall approve said application and return an approved copy to the permit holder. The director of the department of water resources shall give such notice to other affected water users as he deems appropriate and may grant the amendment, in whole or in part or upon conditions, or may deny same. Notice of partial approval or conditions or denial of an amendment shall be forwarded to the applicant by certified mail and shall be subject to judicial review as hereafter provided. The priority of the right established pursuant to a permit which has been amended under these provisions shall date from the date of the original application for permit, provided the permit holder has complied with other provisions of this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      In connection with any application on which permit has not been issued, amendments may be made by indorsement by the applicant or his agent on the original application, which indorsement shall be initialed and dated. If the amendment will result in the use of more water than originally asked, the priority of the right shall be changed to the date of said amendment. The applicant shall also be required to pay any additional filing fee as a result of an amendment of the rate of diversion or volume of storage requested in such amended application. If amendment is made after publication of notice of the original application, said notice shall be republished following amendment, upon payment by the applicant of the statutory fee for republication as in this act provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice shall be published in the same manner as provided by section 42-203 [42-203A], Idaho Code, for publication of notice of an application for permit. Protests to the application for amendment may be filed with and heard by the director in the same manner as provided by section 42-203 [42-203A], Idaho Code, for protests to an application for a permit.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a protest is filed and a hearing on the protest held, any person aggrieved by the final decision of the director following the hearing may seek judicial review thereof pursuant to section 42-1701A(4), Idaho Code.

Jones v. McIntire, 60 Idaho 338, 91 P.2d 373 (1939); Maher v. Gentry, 67 Idaho 559, 186 P.2d 870 (1947); Nordick v. Sorensen, 81 Idaho 117, 338 P.2d 766 (1959).
    The waters of spring on land where they arose and sank were private waters and owner of adjoining land had no right to the use of same in absence of a showing of strict compliance with this section. Maher v. Gentry, 67 Idaho 559, 186 P.2d 870 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an owner of land diverted water from a spring on the land and applied it to a beneficial use, the appropriation was valid when made, and the water right thus perfected was appurtenant to the land which received the benefit of the water and thus passed on to the person who acquired title to the benefited land. Parke v. Bell, 97 Idaho 67, 539 P.2d 995 (1975).

       <p>
        An open flow of water emanating from a mine portal which would not exist absent development of the mine was not nonappropriable private water as defined by this section. Branson v. Miracle, 107 Idaho 221, 687 P.2d 1348 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issue which had previously been litigated concerning whether or not water which flowed from mine tunnel on parties’ property was private or public water was not subject to further review in subsequent action and owners of land were collaterally estopped from raising it.

     <ol>
      <li id="t42c02s42-219ol11">
       Upon receipt by the department of water resources of all the evidence in relation to such final proof, it shall be the duty of the department to carefully examine the same, and if the department is satisfied that the law has been fully complied with and that the water is being used at the place claimed and for the purpose for which it was originally intended, the department shall issue to such user or users a license corresponding to the beneficial use. Such license shall state the name and post office address of such user, the purpose for which such water is used and the quantity of water that may be used, which in no case shall be an amount in excess of the amount that has been beneficially applied. For permits held by a municipal provider for reasonably anticipated future needs, a license may be issued incrementally for an amount corresponding to the beneficial use demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department in each incremental statement of completion showing proof of beneficial use submitted pursuant to section 42-204(4), Idaho Code, which amount, together with any previously licensed portion of said permit, shall not exceed the initial quantity authorized under the permit. The final incremental license at the end of the planning horizon shall be issued for an amount corresponding to the beneficial use. The director shall condition the license to prohibit any transfer of the place of use outside the service area, as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, or to a new nature of use of amounts held for reasonably anticipated future needs together with such other conditions as the director may deem appropriate.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-219ol12">
       If such use is for irrigation, such license shall give a description, by legal subdivisions, of the land irrigated by such water, except that the general description of a place of use described in accordance with subsection (5) or (6) of this section may be described using a digital boundary, as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code. If the use is for municipal purposes, the license shall describe the service area as provided in section 42-202B(9), Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-219ol13">
       Such license shall bear the date of the application for, and the number of, the permit under which the works from which such water is taken were constructed, the date when proof of beneficial use of such water was made, and also the date of the priority of the right confirmed by such license.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-219ol14">
       The date of priority confirmed by the license shall be the date of the application for the permit for the construction of the works from which the water is taken, and to which the right relates, provided there has been no loss of priority under the provisions of this chapter. Whenever proof of the beneficial application of water shall be offered subsequent to the date stated in the permit, or in any authorized extension thereof, when such beneficial application shall be made, the proof shall be taken, if received by the department within the sixty (60) days prescribed in the preceding section. If the proof taken is satisfactory to the department of water resources, a license shall be issued by the department the same as though proof had been made before the date fixed for such beneficial application. The priority of the right established by the proof shall not date back to the date of the application for the permit to which the right would relate under the provisions of this chapter, but shall bear a date subsequent to the date of the application, a time equal to the difference between the date set in the permit, or extension thereof, for such beneficial application of water and the date of proof.
    (5) For irrigation projects where the canals constructed cover an area of twenty-five thousand (25,000) acres or more, or within irrigation districts organized and existing as such under the laws of the state of Idaho, the license issued shall be issued to the persons, association, company, corporation or irrigation district owning the project, and final proof may be made by such owners for the benefit of the entire project. It shall not be necessary to give a description of the land by legal subdivisions, but a general description of the entire area under the canal system shall be sufficient. The water diverted and the water right acquired thereby shall relate to the entire project, and the diversion of the water for the beneficial use under the project shall be sufficient proof of beneficial use without regard as to whether each and every acre under the project is irrigated or not.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (6) For an irrigation project developed under a permit held by an association, company, corporation or the United States to divert and deliver or distribute surface water under any annual charge or rental for beneficial use by more than five (5) water users in an area of less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) acres, the license issued shall be issued to the permit holder. For the place of use description in the license issued for the irrigation project, it shall be sufficient to provide a general description of the area within which the total number of acres developed under the permit are located and within which the location of the licensed acreage can be moved provided there is no injury to other water rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      (7) Subject to other governing law, the location of the acreage irrigated within a generally described place of use, as defined in accordance with subsections (5) and (6) of this section and as filed with the department pursuant to section 43-323, Idaho Code, may be changed without approval under the provisions of section 42-222, Idaho Code. However, the change shall not result in an increase in either the rate of flow diverted or in the total number of acres irrigated under the water right and shall cause no injury to other water rights. If the holder of any water right seeks to challenge such a change, the challenge may be brought only as an action initiating a contested case before the department, pursuant to the administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant, deny or otherwise affect an irrigation district’s authority to deliver water to areas outside the boundaries of such district.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) In the event that the department shall find that the applicant has not fully complied with the law and the conditions of permit, it may issue a license for that portion of the use that is in accordance with the permit or may refuse issuance of a license and void the permit. Notice of such action shall be forwarded to the permit holder by certified mail. The applicant may contest such action by the department pursuant to section 42-1701A(3), Idaho Code.

        Where the United States bureau of reclamation (BOR) filed water right claims against irrigation entities regarding projects developed pursuant to the Reclamation Act of 1902, any rights held by BOR were subject to rights of the beneficial users that were served by the irrigation districts because, inter alia, (1) federal law deferred to state law in determining the rights to water in the reclamation projects, (2) the beneficial users had an interest that was stronger than mere contractual expectancy, and (3) title to the use of the water was held by the consumers or users of the water.

        It was error to grant an investor summary judgment holding that the investor acquired shares in a mutual irrigation company, when the investor acquired land in the company’s boundaries, due to the shares being an appurtenance to the acquired land, because (1) the court did not consider the company’s governing documents, which did not “locate” the shares, or how the company acquired underlying water rights, and (2) the shares were not attached to specific tracts, as the water right had to be read as appurtenant to “any and all” acres within the company’s boundaries.

        Where the United States bureau of reclamation (BOR) filed water right claims against irrigation entities regarding projects developed pursuant to the Reclamation Act of 1902, any rights held by BOR were subject to rights of the beneficial users that were served by the irrigation districts because, inter alia, (1) federal law deferred to state law in determining the rights to water in the reclamation projects, (2) the beneficial users had an interest that was stronger than mere contractual expectancy, and (3) title to the use of the water was held by the consumers or users of the water.

        The evidence was undisputed that the duty of water upon the 217 acres of land would be one inch to the acre in suit brought by plaintiff seeking to have decreed a prior right to the use of 125 miner’s inches for irrigation purposes of certain creek waters which plaintiffs alleged entitlement by reason of a prior decree.

        It was error to grant an investor summary judgment holding that the investor acquired shares in a mutual irrigation company, when the investor acquired land in the company’s boundaries, due to the shares being an appurtenance to the acquired land, because (1) the court did not consider the company’s governing documents, which did not “locate” the shares, or how the company acquired underlying water rights, and (2) the shares were not attached to specific tracts, as the water right had to be read as appurtenant to “any and all” acres within the company’s boundaries.

      <li id="t42c02s42-222ol11">
       Any person, entitled to the use of water whether represented by license issued by the department of water resources, by claims to water rights by reason of diversion and application to a beneficial use as filed under the provisions of this chapter, or by decree of the court, who shall desire to change the point of diversion, place of use, period of use or nature of use of all or part of the water, under the right shall first make application to the department of water resources for approval of such change. Such application shall be upon forms furnished by the department and shall describe the right licensed, claimed or decreed which is to be changed and the changes which are proposed, and shall be accompanied by the statutory filing fee as in this chapter provided. Upon receipt of such application it shall be the duty of the director of the department of water resources to examine same, obtain any consent required in section 42-108, Idaho Code, and if otherwise proper to provide notice of the proposed change in a similar manner as applications under section 42-203A, Idaho Code. Such notice shall advise that anyone who desires to protest the proposed change shall file notice of protests with the department within ten (10) days of the last date of publication. Upon the receipt of any protest, accompanied by the statutory filing fee as provided in section 42-221, Idaho Code, it shall be the duty of the director of the department of water resources to investigate the same and to conduct a hearing thereon. He shall also advise the watermaster of the district in which such water is used of the proposed change and the watermaster shall notify the director of the department of water resources of his recommendation on the application, and the director of the department of water resources shall not finally determine the action on the application for change until he has received from such watermaster his recommendation thereof, which action of the watermaster shall be received and considered as other evidence. For applications proposing to change only the point of diversion or place of use of a water right in a manner that will not change the effect on the source for the right and any other hydraulically-connected sources from the effect resulting under the right as previously approved, and that will not affect the rights of other water users, the director of the department of water resources shall give only such notice to other users as he deems appropriate.
      </li>

       All rights to the use of water acquired under this chapter or otherwise shall be lost and forfeited by a failure for the term of five (5) years to apply it to the beneficial use for which it was appropriated and when any right to the use of water shall be lost through nonuse or forfeiture such rights to such water shall revert to the state and be again subject to appropriation under this chapter; except that any right to the use of water shall not be lost through forfeiture by the failure to apply the water to beneficial use under certain circumstances as specified in section 42-223, Idaho Code. The party asserting that a water right has been forfeited has the burden of proving the forfeiture by clear and convincing evidence.

      <li id="t42c02s42-222ol13">
       Upon proper showing before the director of the department of water resources of good and sufficient reason for nonapplication to beneficial use of such water for such term of five (5) years, the director of the department of water resources is hereby authorized to grant an extension of time extending the time for forfeiture of title for nonuse thereof, to such waters for a period of not to exceed five (5) additional years.
    (4) Application for an extension shall be made before the end of the five (5) year period upon forms to be furnished by the department of water resources and shall fully describe the right on which an extension of time to resume the use is requested and the reasons for such nonuse and shall be accompanied by the statutory filing fee; provided that water rights protected from forfeiture under the provisions of section 42-223, Idaho Code, are exempt from this requirement.

         Upon the receipt of such application it shall be the duty of the director of the department of water resources to examine the same and to provide notice of the application for an extension in the same manner as applications under section 42-203A, Idaho Code. The notice shall fully describe the right, the extension which is requested and the reason for such nonuse and shall state that any person desiring to object to the requested extension may submit a protest, accompanied by the statutory filing fee as provided in section 42-221, Idaho Code, to the director of the department of water resources within ten (10) days of the last date of publication.

         The director of the department of water resources shall find from the evidence presented in any hearing, or from information available to the department, the reasons for such nonuse of water and where it appears to the satisfaction of the director of the department of water resources that other rights will not be impaired by granting an extension of time within which to resume the use of the water and good cause appearing for such nonuse, he may grant one (1) extension of five (5) years within which to resume such use.

         In his approval of the application for an extension of time under this section the director of the department of water resources shall set the date when the use of water is to be resumed. Sixty (60) days before such date the director of the department of water resources shall forward to the applicant at his address of record a notice by certified mail setting forth the date on which the use of water is to be resumed and a form for reporting the resumption of the use of the water right. If the use of the water has not been resumed and report thereon made on or before the date set for resumption of use such right shall revert to the state and again be subject to appropriation, as provided in this section.

     <p>
      When the nature of use of the water right is to be changed to municipal purposes and some or all of the right will be held by a municipal provider to serve reasonably anticipated future needs, the municipal provider shall provide to the department sufficient information and documentation to establish that the applicant qualifies as a municipal provider and that the reasonably anticipated future needs, the service area and the planning horizon are consistent with the definitions and requirements specified in this chapter. The service area need not be described by legal description nor by description of every intended use in detail, but the area must be described with sufficient information to identify the general location where the water under the water right is to be used and the types and quantity of uses that generally will be made.
    When a water right or a portion thereof to be changed is held by a municipal provider for municipal purposes, as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, that portion of the right held for reasonably anticipated future needs at the time of the change shall not be changed to a place of use outside the service area, as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, or to a new nature of use.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director of the department of water resources shall examine all the evidence and available information and shall approve the change in whole, or in part, or upon conditions, provided no other water rights are injured thereby, the change does not constitute an enlargement in use of the original right, the change is consistent with the conservation of water resources within the state of Idaho and is in the local public interest as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, the change will not adversely affect the local economy of the watershed or local area within which the source of water for the proposed use originates, in the case where the place of use is outside of the watershed or local area where the source of water originates, and the new use is a beneficial use, which in the case of a municipal provider shall be satisfied if the water right is necessary to serve reasonably anticipated future needs as provided in this chapter. The director may consider consumptive use, as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, as a factor in determining whether a proposed change would constitute an enlargement in use of the original water right. The director shall not approve a change in the nature of use from agricultural use where such change would significantly affect the agricultural base of the local area. The transfer of the right to the use of stored water for irrigation purposes shall not constitute an enlargement in use of the original right even though more acres may be irrigated, if no other water rights are injured thereby. A copy of the approved application for change shall be returned to the applicant and he shall be authorized upon receipt thereof to make the change and the original water right shall be presumed to have been amended by reason of such authorized change. In the event the director of the department of water resources determines that a proposed change shall not be approved as provided in this section, he shall deny the same and forward notice of such action to the applicant by certified mail, which decision shall be subject to judicial review as hereafter set forth. Provided however, minimum stream flow water rights may not be established under the local public interest criterion, and may only be established pursuant to chapter 15, title 42, Idaho Code.

        Abandonment.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Abandonment is a question of intention and must be evidenced by a clear and decisive act. Idaho Farms Co. v. North Side Canal Co., 24 F. Supp. 189 (D. Idaho 1938), rev’d on other grounds, 107 F.2d 481 (9th Cir. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Patentee of land, over which right of way for reservoir had been granted, or his successor in interest, may institute proceedings to declare forfeiture and quiet title in case of abandonment. Carns v. Idaho-Iowa Lateral & Reservoir Co., 34 Idaho 330, 202 P. 1071 (1921); Hurst v. Idaho-Iowa Lateral & Reservoir Co., 34 Idaho 342, 202 P. 1068 (1921).
    Where it appeared from testimony of engineers that canal of prior appropriator lacked capacity to carry water decreed to it, and that the excess had been returned to stream and used by subsequent appropriators, abandonment resulted against such prior appropriator, a five-year period having elapsed. Albrethsen v. Wood River Land Co., 40 Idaho 49, 231 P. 418 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        An abandonment of a water right must have been continuous for five consecutive years. Carrington v. Crandall, 65 Idaho 525, 147 P.2d 1009 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only when an appropriator abandons his water by failing to apply it to a beneficial use for the statutory period of five years can it be considered and treated as unappropriated public water of the state. Colthorp v. Mountain Home Irrigation Dist., 66 Idaho 173, 157 P.2d 1005 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Water right was not forfeited even though abandoned for over five years where applicant for transfer resumed use of water prior to filing petition for transfer. In re Boyer, 73 Idaho 152, 248 P.2d 540 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        No forfeiture or abandonment results if the nonuser is prevented from exercising his rights by circumstances over which he has no control. Hodges v. Trail Creek Irrigation Co., 78 Idaho 10, 297 P.2d 524 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonpayment of purported upkeep charge by plaintiff did not result in forfeiture or abandonment of plaintiff’s water rights where the plaintiff received no notice or demand for payment from defendant irrigation company. Hodges v. Trail Creek Irrigation Co., 78 Idaho 10, 297 P.2d 524 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        An appropriator who fails to make beneficial use of his water for the statutory period may forfeit his rights, but title to such water right cannot be acquired by another, where such other claimant was the party who prevented the use. Hodges v. Trail Creek Irrigation Co., 78 Idaho 10, 297 P.2d 524 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where protestants asserted that water, which applicant had tried to appropriate by his permit, was seepage water to which they had superior rights through prior use and enjoyment, and there was no evidence as to the actual amount of water used by protestants over and above their decreed rights, or amount claimed at point of diversion that had not been adjudicated, the evidence was insufficient to establish that any of the protestants had abandoned any right to the use of their prior decreed rights. Cantlin v. Carter, 88 Idaho 179, 397 P.2d 761 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A senior appropriator did not lose by laches his right to object to a conflicting diversion by a junior appropriator by failure to assert his rights in previous rights, where such diversion had not previously interfered with his use of the water to which he was entitled. Martiny v. Wells, 91 Idaho 215, 419 P.2d 470 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action brought by upstream landowners against downstream owners who possessed senior water appropriation rights fixed by judicial decree for a declaratory judgment that upstream owners had acquired greater water rights than those fixed in the decree, where the record did not identify any measurable five-year period of downstream owners’ non-use of their senior rights, the trial court was correct in finding that no forfeiture occurred. Gilbert v. Smith, 97 Idaho 735, 552 P.2d 1220 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action brought by upstream landowners against downstream owners who possessed senior water appropriation rights fixed by judicial decree for a declaratory judgment that upstream owners had acquired greater water rights than those fixed in the decree, where the evidence established that downstream owners were often unable to continuously make beneficial use of their senior rights and that upstream owners occasionally interfered with those rights without apparent objection but did not establish a clear intention to abandon the water rights, there was substantial evidence to support the trial court’s finding that upstream owners failed to meet their burden of proving abandonment. Gilbert v. Smith, 97 Idaho 735, 552 P.2d 1220 (1976).
    Mere evidence that beaver dams and sump holes or sinks had caused losses of creek water and difficulty in obtaining water to satisfy water rights of downstream landowner did not establish a case of abandonment or forfeiture, thus upstream landowner who sought to divert the water and apply it to beneficial use could not be permitted to interfere with senior water rights of downstream owner. Gilbert v. Smith, 97 Idaho 735, 552 P.2d 1220 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where lessees had failed to use the full decreed water rights of the river appurtenant to leased farmland, the unused water rights could have been forfeited by non-use prior to the end of the lease to the substantial injury of lessor’s reversionary interest. Olson v. Bedke, 97 Idaho 825, 555 P.2d 156 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent to abandon must be proved by clear and convincing evidence of unequivocal acts, and mere nonuse of a water right, standing alone, is not sufficient for a per se abandonment. Jenkins v. State, Dep’t of Water Resources, 103 Idaho 384, 647 P.2d 1256 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent to abandon is a question of fact to be decided by the trier of fact. Therefore, where the record showed only nonuse, disclosing no intent to abandon, the property owner did not lose his water right by common-law abandonment. Jenkins v. State, Dep’t of Water Resources, 103 Idaho 384, 647 P.2d 1256 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 27 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. § 821, all state water law is preserved “relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water.” Idaho’s state water law, allowing subsequent appropriators to perfect a water right in water that has been abandoned or forfeited clearly relates to the control, appropriation, use or distribution of water; hence, neither the Federal Power Act nor a license issued pursuant to that authority has overridden Idaho’s law of abandonment or forfeiture of water rights. Idaho Power Co. v. State, 104 Idaho 575, 661 P.2d 741 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the language of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.61.html#t61c03s61-327" target="_blank">§§ 61-327 </a></cite>to 61-331 is very broad in forbidding any transfer “directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever” of electric utility property (§ 61-328), such sections are inapplicable to abandonment or forfeiture of a water right. If those sections were applied to abandonment or forfeiture of a water right used to generate electricity, the attorney general would be required to file an action to have such an escheat decreed, and thereafter there would be a court ordered sale of the property; such a scheme is totally inconsistent with subsection (2) of this section, which provides that if a water right is abandoned or forfeited it reverts to the state, following which third parties may perfect an interest therein. Idaho Power Co. v. State, 104 Idaho 575, 661 P.2d 741 (1983).

       <p>
        If no public interest is forwarded by the abandonment, equity is against declaring a forfeiture. Idaho Farms Co. v. North Side Canal Co., 24 F. Supp. 189 (D. Idaho 1938), rev’d on other grounds, 107 F.2d 481 (9th Cir. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Abandonment and forfeitures of water rights are not favored, and, even though forfeited and abandoned for five years prior to the time that subsequent appropriators initiated their right, if, subsequent to such five-year period, and prior to such subsequent appropriators’ initiation of their right, the first appropriators and their predecessors in interest under claim of right and continuity of interest again began to exercise their water rights, there would be no abandonment which could inure to the benefit of subsequent appropriators. Zezi v. Lightfoot, 57 Idaho 707, 68 P.2d 50 (1937).
    Forfeiture of water rights is not favored, and all intendments are to be indulged in against a forfeiture. Hodges v. Trail Creek Irrigation Co., 78 Idaho 10, 297 P.2d 524 (1956).

       <p>
        When a civilian conservation corps camp was dismantled and a waterline by which it received water from a nearby creek was abandoned, such waterline became the property of the state of Idaho and was not included in a deed of land which included in its habendum clause “the appurtenances thereon.” Sutton v.

        Although the doctrine of beneficial use is a concept that is constitutionally recognized and that permeates Idaho’s water code, the Idaho Constitution does not mandate that non-application to a beneficial use, for any period of time no matter how small, results in the loss or reduction of water rights.

        The owner of a water right had the statutory right to change his point of diversion provided that the rights of others were not injured, and such change did not work a forfeiture or an abandonment of such right. Graham v. Leek, 65 Idaho 279, 144 P.2d 475 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        A change in point of use will not be permitted without limitations if the enlarged use in time or amount increases the burden on the stream, or decreases the volume of water in the stream to the injury of appropriators on the stream. Beecher v. Cassia Creek Irrigation Co., 66 Idaho 1, 154 P.2d 507 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the original permit incorrectly located the point of diversion, a subsequent petition to correct this designation to conform to the actual point of diversion was not a petition to change the point of diversion. Keller v. Magic Water Co., 92 Idaho 276, 441 P.2d 725 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error for the district court to enjoin landowners from changing the point of diversion of water from a well located on one section of their land to another, where such owners had filed a proper application for such change with the state reclamation engineer (now director of the department of water resources), who declined to hear or process the application.

        So long as that water which arrived at its destination was put to a beneficial use, and so long as the amount of water lost through seepage during the transportation of that water from its place of origin to its place of use was reasonable, it could not be said that the mere fact of seepage transformed it into water not beneficially used.

        Where plaintiffs attempted to establish, at trial, that they had established a right to disputed water with the original priority dates of 1872, 1873 and 1879, it was inconsistent for them to argue on appeal that the rights were forfeited under this section, since under a forfeiture theory the priority date of the original appropriator is lost, the water rights revert to the state and the subsequent appropriator does not obtain title to the rights dating back to the original user’s priority date. Thus, since plaintiff began using defendant’s water in 1939 the forfeiture period under this section would run to 1944 and the water rights would then have reverted to the state, to become available to plaintiffs for appropriation. Sears v. Berryman, 101 Idaho 843, 623 P.2d 455 (1981).
    Forfeitures are not favored, and clear and convincing proof is required to support a forfeiture. Jenkins v. State, Dep’t of Water Resources, 103 Idaho 384, 647 P.2d 1256 (1982).

        Wrongful interference with a water right or failure to use the water because of circumstances over which the water right holder had no control have been recognized as defenses to forfeiture. Jenkins v. State, Dep’t of Water Resources, 103 Idaho 384, 647 P.2d 1256 (1982).

        Where there was substantial, albeit conflicting, evidence indicating that property owner had failed to use any creek water for a beneficial use between 1961 and 1979, a period of 18 years, and the local water master testified that he had delivered water from the creek for those 18 years, but had not delivered nor been requested to deliver any of the creek water to said property owner, the trial court finding that the channels from the creek to a second creek did not carry a regular flow of water except during the spring runoff, supported the conclusion of a statutory forfeiture and the denial of the property owner’s application for transfer of point of diversion. Jenkins v. State, Dep’t of Water Resources, 103 Idaho 384, 647 P.2d 1256 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Forfeiture of water rights is conceptually distinct from common-law abandonment. While abandonment is predicated upon the elements of intent and conduct, and it requires an intent to abandon and the actual surrender or relinquishment of water rights, statutory forfeiture provides that all rights to water are lost where the appropriator fails to make “beneficial use” of the water for a continuous five-year period regardless of intent. McAtee v. Faulkner Land & Livestock, Inc., 113 Idaho 393, 744 P.2d 121 (Ct. App. 1987).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where stockholders wished to use forfeiture only to avoid paying maintenance assessments, the adjudication court’s determination that no water rights were forfeited was affirmed; a finding of forfeiture by an appropriator who did nothing to cause the nonuse of the water would have done nothing to advance the policy behind the statute to secure the maximum use and benefit of the state’s water resources. Aberdeen-Springfield Canal Co. v. Peiper, 133 Idaho 82, 982 P.2d 917 (1999).
       </p>

        Where the majority of the property had not been irrigated for more than five consecutive years, it resulted in a forfeiture under subsection (2) of this section. McCray v. Rosenkrance, 135 Idaho 509, 20 P.3d 693 (2001).

        The “no control” exception to forfeiture of a water right is codified in<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t42c02s42-223" target="_self">§ 42-223</a></cite>(6), which provides that no portion of any water right shall be lost or forfeited for nonuse if the nonuse results from circumstances over which the water right owner has no control. Whether the water right owner has control over nonuse of water shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. The availability of water qualifies as a circumstance over which an appropriator has no control. That is, for a water right to be forfeited, water must be available to satisfy the water right during the alleged period of non-use. Barnes v. Jackson, 163 Idaho 194, 408 P.3d 1266 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        The resumption-of-use doctrine is a defense to forfeiture of a water rigfht, if, after five years of nonuse, the appropriator resumes use prior to a claim of right by a third party. Therefore, to avoid forfeiture, resumption-of-use must occur prior to a claim of right by a third party. A third party has made a claim of right if he has: (1) instituted proceedings to declare a forfeiture; (2) obtained a valid water right authorizing the use of such water with a priority date prior to the resumption of use; or (3) used the water pursuant to an existing water right. Barnes v. Jackson, 163 Idaho 194, 408 P.3d 1266 (2018).

         Upon declaration of a drought emergency for an area designated by the director of the department of water resources and approved by the governor of the state of Idaho, the director of the department of water resources is authorized to allow temporary changes to the use of water rights consisting of temporary transfers to change point of diversion, place and purpose of use of valid existing water rights or temporary exchanges of water authorized to be diverted under water rights, as provided in section 42-240, Idaho Code, when the director of the department of water resources determines that such change(s) can be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this section.
        </li>
        <li id="t42c02s42-222Aol12">
         Application for a temporary change shall be made upon forms provided by the department of water resources and shall be accompanied by an application fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per application.

        <li id="t42c02s42-222Aol13">
         The director of the department of water resources is not required to publish notice of the proposed change pursuant to the provisions of section 42-211, 42-222(1) or 42-240, Idaho Code, and is not required to make findings as provided in said sections. A temporary change may be approved upon completion of the application form, payment of the filing fee and a determination by the director of the department of water resources that the proposed change can be properly administered and there is no information that the change will injure any other water right. If the water right to be changed is administered by a watermaster within a water district, the director of the department of water resources shall obtain and consider the recommendations of the watermaster before approving the temporary change application.
        </li>
        <li id="t42c02s42-222Aol14">
         All temporary changes approved pursuant to the provisions of this section shall expire on the date shown in the approval which shall not be later than December 31 of the year in which the emergency transfer approval is made and thereafter the water right shall revert to the point of diversion and place of use existing prior to the temporary change. Nothing herein shall be construed as approval to authorize the construction of a new well as a new point of diversion.

        <li id="t42c02s42-222Aol15">
         The recipient of an approved temporary change issued pursuant to this section shall assume all risk that the diversion and use of the water may cause injury to other water rights, that the change constitutes an enlargement in use of the original right, that the use is not consistent with the conservation of water resources within the state of Idaho and that such use is not in the local public interest. Any applicant for a temporary change who is aggrieved by a denial by the director of the department of water resources of a temporary change pursuant to this section may request a hearing pursuant to the provisions of section 42-1701A(3), Idaho Code, and may seek judicial review of the final order of the director pursuant to the provisions of section 42-1701A(4), Idaho Code.

If the right to use the water, the diversion works or the water delivery system is represented by shares of stock in a corporation or if such right, diversion works or delivery system is owned or managed by an irrigation district, no change in point of diversion or place or nature of use of such water shall be made or allowed without the written consent of such corporation or irrigation district.

        The “no control” exception to forfeiturew of a water right is codified in subsection (6), which provides that no portion of any water right shall be lost or forfeited for nonuse if the nonuse results from circumstances over which the water right owner has no control. Whether the water right owner has control over nonuse of water shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. The availability of water qualifies as a circumstance over which an appropriator has no control. That is, for a water right to be forfeited, water must be available to satisfy the water right during the alleged period of non-use. Barnes v. Jackson, 163 Idaho 194, 408 P.3d 1266 (2018).

      § 42-226. Ground waters are public waters.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The traditional policy of the state of Idaho, requiring the water resources of this state to be devoted to beneficial use in reasonable amounts through appropriation, is affirmed with respect to the ground water resources of this state as said term is hereinafter defined and, while the doctrine of “first in time is first in right” is recognized, a reasonable exercise of this right shall not block full economic development of underground water resources. Prior appropriators of underground water shall be protected in the maintenance of reasonable ground water pumping levels as may be established by the director of the department of water resources as herein provided. In determining a reasonable ground water pumping level or levels, the director of the department of water resources shall consider and protect the thermal and/or artesian pressure values for low temperature geothermal resources and for geothermal resources to the extent that he determines such protection is in the public interest. All ground waters in this state are declared to be the property of the state, whose duty it shall be to supervise their appropriation and allotment to those diverting the same for beneficial use. This act shall not affect the rights to the use of ground water in this state acquired before its enactment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any application for a water permit that seeks to transfer ground water outside the immediate ground water basin as defined by the director of the department of water resources for the purpose of irrigating five thousand (5,000) or more acres on a continuing basis or for a total volume in excess of ten thousand (10,000) acre feet per year, the application must first be approved by the director of the department of water resources and then by the Idaho legislature. Each shall give due consideration to the local economic and ecological impact of the project or development so proposed.

       <p>
        Prior to the enactment of the ground water act in 1951, the doctrine of prior appropriation, i.e., first in time is first in right, governed the appropriation of ground water in this state, and although this doctrine was modified in certain respects by the enactment of the ground water act, the law applicable to ground water used for domestic purposes was not significantly modified by the act.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under the doctrine of prior appropriation, because the plaintiff’s domestic well was drilled prior to the defendant’s irrigation well, the plaintiff had a vested right to use the water for his domestic well. That right included the right to have the water available at the historic pumping level or to be compensated for expenses incurred if the defendant subsequent appropriator was allowed to lower the water table and the plaintiff was required to change his method or means of diversion in order to maintain his right to use the water. Parker v. Wallentine, 103 Idaho 506, 650 P.2d 648 (1982), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

        Under the doctrine of prior appropriation, because the plaintiff’s domestic well was drilled prior to the defendant’s irrigation well, the plaintiff had a vested right to use the water for his domestic well. That right included the right to have the water available at the historic pumping level or to be compensated for expenses incurred if the defendant subsequent appropriator was allowed to lower the water table and the plaintiff was required to change his method or means of diversion in order to maintain his right to use the water. Parker v. Wallentine, 103 Idaho 506, 650 P.2d 648 (1982), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

        A perpetual injunction should not be granted if, by changing the prior appropriator’s method or means of diversion, both parties can be supplied with water.

Usage of a low temperature geothermal resource primarily for reasons other than heat value is not a beneficial use of the resource, unless the director of the department of water resources exempts the proposed use. The director may exempt a proposed use if the director concludes:

The evidence of causation must come from the department or be credible information from a water right or a geothermal resource permit holder existing at the time of the development of the oil and gas well. It shall be the burden of the entity operating the oil and gas well to establish that it will not cause, is not causing and has not caused significant negative impacts to pressure, temperature, quality necessary for beneficial use or quantity of water available to existing water rights existing at the time of the development of the oil and gas well or to a water resource that can be beneficially used. If the director determines that the well will cause, is causing or has caused significant negative impacts to pressure, temperature, quality necessary for beneficial use or quantity of water available to a water right existing at the time of the development of the oil and gas well or to a water resource that can be beneficially used, the director may order the operator to take measures to mitigate those impacts.

The surety or cash bond shall be conditioned upon the proper compliance with the provisions of this chapter and chapter 40, title 42, Idaho Code, and rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. The bond shall remain in effect for one (1) year following completion of drilling, redrilling, modifying or deepening of the well or until released in writing by the director, whichever occurs first.

      § 42-233a. “Critical ground water area” defined — Public hearings — Publication of notice — Granting or denial of application — Appeal.
     </h3>
     <p>
      “Critical ground water area” is defined as any ground water basin, or designated part thereof, not having sufficient ground water to provide a reasonably safe supply for irrigation of cultivated lands, or other uses in the basin at the then-current rates of withdrawal, or rates of withdrawal projected by consideration of valid and outstanding applications and permits, as may be determined and designated, from time to time, by the director of the department of water resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the designation of a “critical ground water area,” it shall be the duty of the director of the department of water resources to conduct a public hearing in the area concerned to apprise the public of such designation and the reasons therefor. Notice of the hearing shall be published in two (2) consecutive weekly issues of a newspaper of general circulation in the area immediately prior to the date set for hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event an area has been designated as a “critical ground water area” and the director of the department of water resources desires to remove such designation or modify the boundaries thereof, he shall likewise conduct a public hearing following similar publication of notice prior to taking such action.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a “critical ground water area” is designated by the director of the department of water resources, or at any time thereafter during the existence of the designation, the director may approve a ground water management plan for the area. The ground water management plan shall provide for managing the effects of ground water withdrawals on the aquifer from which withdrawals are made and on any other hydraulically connected sources of water.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event an application for permit is made with respect to an area that has not been designated as a critical ground water area, the director of the department of water resources shall forthwith issue a permit in accordance with the provisions of section 42-203A and section 42-204, Idaho Code, provided said application otherwise meets the requirements of such sections; and further provided that if the applicant proposes to appropriate water from a ground water basin or basins in an amount which exceeds ten thousand (10,000) acre-feet per year either from a single or a combination of diversion points, and the director determines that the withdrawal of such amount will substantially and adversely affect existing pumping levels of appropriators pumping from such basin or basins, or will substantially and adversely affect the amount of water available for withdrawal from such basin or basins under existing water rights, the director may require that the applicant undertake such recharge of the ground water basin or basins as will offset that withdrawal adversely affecting existing pumping levels or water rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event an application for permit is made in an area which has been designated as a critical ground water area, if the director of the department of water resources from the investigation made by him on said application as herein provided, or from the investigation made by him in determining the area to be critical, or from other information that has come officially to his attention, has reason to believe that there is insufficient water available subject to appropriation at the location of the proposed well described in the application, the director of the department of water resources may forthwith deny said application; provided, however, that if ground water at such location is available in a lesser amount than that applied for, the director of the department of water resources may issue a permit for the use of such water to the extent that such water is available for such appropriation.
    The director may require all water right holders within a critical ground water area to report withdrawals of ground water and other necessary information for the purpose of assisting him in determining available ground water supplies and their usage.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director, upon determination that the ground water supply is insufficient to meet the demands of water rights within all or portions of a critical ground water area, shall order those water right holders on a time priority basis, within the area determined by the director, to cease or reduce withdrawal of water until such time as the director determines there is sufficient ground water. Water right holders participating in an approved ground water management plan shall not be subject to administration on a time priority basis as long as they are in compliance with the ground water management plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the director of the department of water resources may appeal to the district court in the manner provided for in section 42-237e, Idaho Code.

       It is the policy of the state of Idaho to promote and encourage the optimum development and augmentation of the water resources of this state. The legislature deems it essential, therefore, that water projects designed to advance this policy be given maximum support. The legislature finds that the use of water to recharge ground water basins in accordance with Idaho law and the state water plan may enhance the full realization of our water resource potential by furthering water conservation and increasing the water available for beneficial use.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-234ol12">
       The legislature hereby declares that the appropriation of water for purposes of ground water recharge shall constitute a beneficial use of water. The director of the department of water resources is authorized to issue permits and licenses for the purpose of ground water recharge, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and in compliance with other applicable Idaho law and the state water plan.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-234ol13">
       The director of the department of water resources may regulate the amount of water which may be diverted for recharge purposes and may reduce such amount, even though there is sufficient water to supply the entire amount originally authorized by permit or license. To facilitate necessary financing of an aquifer recharge project, the director may fix a term of years in the permit or license during which the amount of water authorized to be diverted shall not be reduced by the director under the provisions of this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-234ol14">
       To ensure that other water rights are not injured by the operations of an aquifer recharge project, the director of the department of water resources shall have the authority to approve, disapprove or require alterations in the methods employed to achieve ground water recharge. In the event that the director determines that the methods of operation are adversely affecting existing water rights or are creating conditions adverse to the beneficial use of water under existing water rights, the director shall order the cessation of operations until such alterations as may be ordered by the director have been accomplished or such adverse effects otherwise have been corrected.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-234ol15">
       The legislature further recognizes that incidental ground water recharge benefits are often obtained from the diversion and use of water for various beneficial purposes. However, such incidental recharge may not be used as the basis for claim of a separate or expanded water right. Incidental recharge of aquifers which occurs as a result of water diversion and use that does not exceed the vested water right of water right holders is in the public interest. The values of such incidental recharge shall be considered in the management of the state’s water resources.

      § 42-235. Drilling permits.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Prior to beginning construction of any well, or changing the construction of any well, the driller or well owner shall obtain a permit from the director of the department of water resources to protect the public health, safety and welfare and the environment, and to prevent the waste of water or mixture of water from different aquifers. There shall be a seventy-five dollar ($75.00) charge for the permit if the well is to be used for domestic or monitoring purposes. If the well is to be used for other than domestic or monitoring purposes, the charge for the permit shall be two hundred dollars ($200). All moneys received pursuant to this section shall be credited to the water administration account. The director may provide a blanket drilling permit for site specific monitoring programs which will determine the quality, quantity, temperature, pressure or other attributes of aquifers. The application for a blanket permit shall include a design proposal prepared by a licensed engineer or licensed geologist which shall describe the overall drilling program and all relevant technical features of the wells to the satisfaction of the director. Progress reports, completion and other data may be required as provided by rule. The fee for the blanket permit shall be one hundred dollars ($100) plus an additional fifty dollars ($50.00) per well. A driller or well owner violating any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall also be subject to the enforcement procedures of section 42-1701B, Idaho Code.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In the administration and enforcement of this act and in the effectuation of the policy of this state to conserve its ground water resources, the director of the department of water resources in his sole discretion, is empowered:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1a">
       a. To require all flowing wells to be so capped or equipped with valves that the flow of water can be completely stopped when the wells are not in use.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1b">
       b. To require both flowing and nonflowing wells to be so constructed and maintained as to prevent the waste of ground waters through leaky wells, casings, pipes, fittings, valves or pumps either above or below the land surface.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1c">
       c. To prescribe uniform scientific methods to determine water levels in and calculate waters withdrawn from wells.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1d">
       d. To go upon all lands, both public and private, for the purpose of inspecting wells, pumps, casings, pipes, and fittings, including wells used or claimed to be used for domestic purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1e">
       e. To order the cessation of use of a well pending the correction of any defect that the director of the department of water resources has ordered corrected.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1f">
       f. To commence actions to enjoin the illegal opening or excavation of wells or withdrawal or use of water therefrom and to appear and become a party to any action or proceeding pending in any court or administrative agency when it appears to the director of the department of water resources that the determination of such action or proceeding might result in depletion of the ground water resources of the state contrary to the public policy expressed in this act.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1g">
       g. To supervise and control the exercise and administration of all rights to the use of ground waters and in the exercise of this discretionary power he may initiate administrative proceedings to prohibit or limit the withdrawal of water from any well during any period that he determines that water to fill any water right in said well is not there available. To assist the director of the department of water resources in the administration and enforcement of this act, and in making determinations upon which said orders shall be based, he may establish a ground water pumping level or levels in an area or areas having a common ground water supply as determined by him as hereinafter provided. Water in a well shall not be deemed available to fill a water right therein if withdrawal therefrom of the amount called for by such right would affect, contrary to the declared policy of this act, the present or future use of any prior surface or ground water right or result in the withdrawing of the ground water supply at a rate beyond the reasonably anticipated average rate of future natural recharge. However, the director may allow withdrawal at a rate exceeding the reasonably anticipated rate of future natural recharge if the director finds it is in the public interest and if it satisfies the following criteria:
       <ol>
        <li id="t42c02s42-237aol1g1">
         A program exists or likely will exist which will increase recharge or decrease withdrawals within a time period acceptable to the director to bring withdrawals into balance with recharge.

         Holders of senior rights to use ground water will not be caused thereby to pump water from below the established reasonable pumping level or levels.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In connection with his supervision and control of the exercise of ground water rights the director of the department of water resources shall also have the power to determine what areas of the state have a common ground water supply and whenever it is determined that any area has a ground water supply which affects the flow of water in any stream or streams in an organized water district, to incorporate such area in said water district; and whenever it is determined that the ground water in an area having a common ground water supply does not affect the flow of water in any stream in an organized water district, to incorporate such area in a separate water district to be created in the same manner provided for in section 42-604 of title 42, Idaho Code. The administration of water rights within water districts created or enlarged pursuant to this act shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of title 42, Idaho Code, as the same have been or may hereafter be amended, except that in the administration of ground water rights either the director of the department of water resources or the watermaster in a water district or the director of the department of water resources outside of a water district shall, upon determining that there is not sufficient water in a well to fill a particular ground water right therein by order, limit or prohibit further withdrawals of water under such right as hereinabove provided, and post a copy of said order at the place where such water is withdrawn; provided, that land, not irrigated with underground water, shall not be subject to any allotment, charge, assessment, levy, or budget for, or in connection with, the distribution or delivery of water.
    h. To order the installation and maintenance of approved measuring devices consistent with the purposes of section 42-701, Idaho Code.

All parties to the hearing shall be entitled to be heard in person or by attorney. Upon such hearing the board shall have authority to determine the existence and nature of the respective water rights claimed by the parties and whether the use of the junior right affects, contrary to the declared policy of this act, the use of the senior right. If the board finds that the use of any junior right or rights so affect the use of senior rights, it may order the holders of the junior right or rights to cease using their right during such period or periods as the board may determine and may provide such cessation shall be either in whole or in part or under such conditions for the repayment of water to senior right holders as the board may determine. Any person violating such an order made hereunder shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever a written statement of claim as provided in section 42-237b[, Idaho Code,]hereof is filed with the director of the department of water resources, if the statement of the claimant is deemed sufficient by the director of the department of water resources and meets the requirements of section 42-237b[, Idaho Code], the said director of the department of water resources shall forthwith proceed to form a local ground water board for the purpose of hearing such claim. The said local ground water board shall consist of the director of the department of water resources, and a person who is a qualified engineer or geologist, appointed by the district judge of the judicial district which includes the county in which the well of respondent, or one of the respondents if there be more than one, is located, and a third member to be appointed by the other two, who shall be a resident irrigation farmer of the county in which the well of respondent, or one of the respondents if there be more than one, is located. None of such members shall be persons owning or claiming water right which may be affected by such claim, nor members of the board of directors of any irrigation district or canal company owning or claiming water rights affected by such claims. No employee of the state of Idaho other than said director of the department of water resources is eligible for appointment to a ground water board. Members of the board shall hold office until the board has finally disposed of the claim which it was appointed to hear. Such members shall serve without pay except that members other than the director of the department of water resources shall receive per diem of $25.00 together with reimbursement of expenses actually incurred during the time actually spent in the performance of official duties, such per diem and expenses to be paid from the ground water administration fund [water administration account] hereinafter created. Whenever such a local ground water board is needed to be formed in any county, the director of the department of water resources shall give notice of that fact to the district judge of the judicial district which includes the county in which the well of respondents, or one of the respondents if there be more than one, is located, and thereupon such judge shall appoint a person to be a member of such board. Upon qualification by such member, the third member shall be selected. The director of the department of water resources shall be the chairman of the board and custodian of all its records. He may be represented at any board meeting by a duly appointed, qualified and acting deputy director of the department of water resources.

       Driller’s licenses and operator’s permits issued under this section shall expire on March 31 in the second year after issuance or upon revocation of the license by the director as provided for in this act. The driller’s license can be renewed effective April 1 of every other year upon written application on forms provided by the director and the filing of a one hundred dollar ($100) renewal fee plus a fifteen dollar ($15.00) renewal fee for each operator employed by the licensed driller. Drillers renewing licenses in 1997 shall be assessed a licensing fee prorated monthly based upon the annual fee schedule. Thereafter, driller licenses and operator permits will be renewed upon expiration for a two (2) year period. Documents demonstrating compliance with the continuing education requirements of the rules shall be submitted to the director along with other license and permit renewal documents. The renewal request must be accompanied by a new bond or evidence that the previous bond is still in effect. The renewal may then be granted by the director if he determines that the driller or operator has complied with the rules promulgated pursuant to this act. The fees collected for the licensing of well drillers and permitting of operators are nonrefundable and shall be deposited in the water administration fund [account] with the state treasurer with other fees collected by the director.
    (10) The licensed driller and permitted operators shall have a card on hand, provided by the director to indicate that the driller or operator is presently licensed or permitted at all times when he is operating the drilling equipment. The director may also require other identification to be posted on the drilling equipment as he deems helpful in the administration of this act.

      (11) Well driller’s report. In order to enable a comprehensive survey of the extent and occurrence of the state’s ground water resource, every well driller is hereby required to keep available for inspection at the well site a daily well log and pertinent data concerning each well, and its construction or abandonment, that is constructed or abandoned under the driller’s direction in Idaho, including wells excepted under sections 42-227 and 42-228, Idaho Code, and complete a report on forms furnished by the director. These reports shall be properly prepared and signed by the driller and deposited with the director within thirty (30) days following the completion of the well. When the driller signs the report, the driller shall attest that all information on the report is accurate to the best of the driller’s knowledge and that the driller has met all minimum well construction standards, low temperature geothermal resource well construction standards, geothermal resource well construction standards and area of drilling concern standards as adopted by the water resource board. The reports shall become a permanent record in the office of the director for hydrologic and geologic analysis and research, and shall be available for public use. The report shall include such data as the director deems necessary to provide the information that will be valuable for future reference and study.
     </p>
     <p>
      (12) Well construction standards. The water resource board shall adopt minimum standards for new well construction, modification and abandonment of existing wells, low temperature geothermal resource well construction and geothermal well construction in this state under the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. Such standards shall require each well to be so constructed as to protect the ground water of the state from waste and contamination and may include additional requirements for wells drilled in “areas of drilling concern” as designated in accordance with subsection (15) of this section. Every licensed well driller will be furnished a copy of the adopted standards by the director, and will be required to construct or abandon each well in compliance with the adopted standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      (13) Penalties for violation. Drilling of a well without first obtaining a license as required in this section shall be a criminal misdemeanor, and the employees of the department of water resources are hereby empowered to issue Idaho uniform citations, as provided by the rules of the court for magistrate’s division of the district court, to any person who drills a well without first obtaining the required license. When the director of the department of water resources determines that any person is in substantial violation of any provision of this section or any rule, permit, condition of approval or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this section, the director may commence an administrative enforcement action by issuing a written notice of violation in accordance with the provisions of section 42-1701B, Idaho Code. Failure of the driller to comply with the provisions of section 42-238(11), Idaho Code, will allow the director to proceed to collect the necessary data on the well or wells in any manner available to him, and the cost of this data collection may be charged against the driller’s bond in the amount of the expenses incurred up to the total amount of the bond.
    (a) Failure of the driller to comply with the provisions of section 42-238(11), Idaho Code, is also cause for the director to revoke an active license, or refuse to renew a license, until such time as the well driller’s report or reports are properly completed and on file in the office of the director. If it is found that a driller has intentionally submitted inaccurate or false information in the signed well driller’s report as provided in subsection (11) of this section, or has failed to file a report within the time frame required, the driller shall be liable for a civil penalty as provided in section 42-1701B, Idaho Code. In addition, this shall be cause for the director to suspend an active license for a period not in excess of one (1) year or to not renew a license.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Failure of the driller to comply with the provisions of section 42-238(12), Idaho Code, will allow the director to proceed to repair, reconstruct or abandon a well so that it complies with the adopted minimum standards of well construction and abandonment, and the costs of this work may be charged against the driller’s bond in the amount of the expenses incurred up to the total amount of the bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) Failure of the driller to comply with the provisions of section 42-238(12), Idaho Code, is also cause for the director to revoke an active license or refuse to renew a license until such time as the well driller has repaired or reconstructed the well or wells so that they meet the adopted minimum standards. Any driller, well owner or well pump installer causing a well to be altered or modified so as to not meet the construction standards provided for under this section, shall be deemed to have violated the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of section 42-1701B, Idaho Code. The director may also require that the well driller present evidence to show that he and his equipment are now capable of constructing a well in a proper manner, before the license is renewed.
     </p>
     <p>
      (14) Appeals. Refusal to issue, refusal to renew, or revocation of a well driller’s license or operator’s permit by the director shall be cause for the well driller to seek a public hearing before the water resource board. No formal petition shall be required from the affected driller or operator, but a simple statement, in writing, requesting a hearing shall be sufficient. The board shall notify the driller or operator, and the director, of the date set for the hearing, which shall be at least fifteen (15) days after the notice is sent by certified mail to the well driller or operator at his address of record with the department. A certified transcript of the proceedings and the evidence received at such hearing shall be maintained by the board. The board shall affirm, modify or reject the director’s decision, and make its decision in the form of an order to the director. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and rules of practice and procedure adopted by the water resource board. Any party to the hearing may seek judicial review of any final order of the water resource board pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      (15) Drilling in a designated “area of drilling concern.” The director of the department of water resources may designate as he determines necessary, “areas of drilling concern” on an aquifer by aquifer basis within which drillers must comply with the additional requirements of this section. The director shall designate “areas of drilling concern” to protect public health and to prevent waste or contamination of ground or surface water because of factors such as aquifer pressure, vertical depth of the aquifer, warm or hot ground water, or contaminated ground or surface waters. It is unlawful for any person not meeting the requirements of this subsection to drill a well for any purpose in a designated “area of drilling concern.” Any person drilling a new well or deepening or modifying an existing well for any purpose in an “area of drilling concern” as designated by the director as herein provided shall comply with the following additional requirements:
    (a) Additional bonding requirements, as determined by the director, to insure that the well is constructed or abandoned in compliance with the adopted standards for well construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Additional experience and knowledge in drilling wells encountering warm water or pressurized aquifers as required by rules adopted by the water resource board.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) Document that specialized equipment needed to drill wells in “areas of drilling concern,” as determined by the director, is or will be available to the driller.
     </p>
     <p>
      (d) Provide a notice of intent to drill, deepen or modify a well, submit plans and specifications for the well and a description of the drilling methods that will be used, as required by the director, and receive the written approval of the director before commencing to drill, deepen, or modify any well in a designated “area of drilling concern.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to designating an “area of drilling concern,” the director shall conduct a public hearing in or near the area to determine the public interest concerning the designation. Notice of the hearing shall be published in two (2) consecutive weekly issues of a newspaper of general circulation in the area prior to the date set for hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event an area has been designated as an “area of drilling concern” and the director of the department of water resources desires to remove such designation or modify the boundaries thereof, he shall likewise conduct a public hearing following similar publication of notice prior to taking such action.

       Upon receipt of the application, it shall be the duty of the director to examine the same and, if otherwise proper, to cause notice of the proposed exchange to be published in the same manner as applications under section 42-203A, Idaho Code. The notice shall fully describe the nature of the proposed exchange of water and shall advise that anyone who wishes to protest shall file notice of protest in accordance with the provisions of section 42-203A, Idaho Code.

      <li id="t42c02s42-240ol14">
       Upon the receipt of any protest it shall be the duty of the director to investigate the same and to conduct a hearing thereon. The director shall also advise the watermaster of the district in which the exchange is proposed, if a district exists, and the watermaster shall notify the director of the watermaster’s recommendations on the application. The director shall not take final action on the application or exchange until the director has received the recommendations of the watermaster, including recommended conditions necessary for the exchange of water to be properly administered and regulated.

       The director shall examine all the evidence and available information and shall approve the exchange in whole, or in part, or upon conditions, provided no other water rights are injured thereby, the exchange does not constitute an enlargement in use of the original right or rights, the exchange is consistent with the conservation of water resources within the state of Idaho, the exchange is in the local public interest as defined in section 42-202B, Idaho Code, and the exchange will not adversely affect the local economy of the watershed or local area within which the source of water for the proposed use originates, in the case where the place of use is outside of the watershed or local area where the source of water originates. Unless otherwise provided in a written agreement between the applicant and other right holders, the director shall condition approval of an exchange so that the exchange will not be operative during times when water is not available to satisfy the exchange, and that during these times the right to use water automatically reverts to the place of use authorized under the water rights. A copy of the approved application for exchange shall be provided to the applicant and the watermaster, and the applicant shall be authorized upon receipt thereof to make the exchange in accordance with the conditions set forth by the director. Should an approved exchange thereafter be discontinued, the applicant or the applicant’s successor in interest must so notify the director and the district watermaster.
    (6) In the absence of a contrary agreement by the parties to an exchange, when the director has approved a right to exchange storage water for the natural flow of a stream or other water supply, the storage water shall be delivered in preference to any exchange rights subsequently approved using the same storage water right.

      (7) Any person or persons feeling themselves aggrieved by a final order or final action of the director under this section may, if a protest was filed and hearing held thereon, seek judicial review pursuant to section 42-1701A(4), Idaho Code. If no protest was filed and no hearing held, the applicant may request a hearing pursuant to section 42-1701A(3), Idaho Code, for the purpose of contesting the action of the director and may seek judicial review of the final order of the director following the hearing pursuant to section 42-1701A(4), Idaho Code.

     <p>
      In order to allow for the recording of historic uses of the waters of this state, any person using or claiming rights to the use of water for uses other than domestic purposes, which have heretofore been established by diversion and application to a beneficial use shall file a claim of such right with the department of water resources not later than June 30, 1983, or if mailed, shall be postmarked not later than June 30, 1983. Such claim shall be in affidavit form on forms furnished by the department of water resources and shall set forth:

      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-243ol1f">
       f. The priority of the right claimed which shall be determined by the date when the water was first applied to a beneficial use provided there has been no period of abandonment or nonuse or forfeiture of the water right since that date.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c02s42-243ol1g">
       g. If water is claimed for irrigation, the legal description of the lands irrigated.

      Such claim may be accompanied by maps showing the place of use, affidavits of witnesses familiar with the uses claimed, measurements of the water diverted and used, and such other information as the claimant may wish to submit.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the claim is filed with the department of water resources later than June 30, 1983, or if it is mailed to the department of water resources and the postmark is later than June 30, 1983, the claim shall be classified as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. If the only use identified on the claim is domestic purposes, then the claim will be considered to be filed in a timely manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. If the use(s) identified on the claim includes other than domestic purposes, then the claim shall be considered to be a late claim, with a unique filing fee as set forth in section 42-221, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall not apply to any water rights which are based on the authority of a permit or license issued by the department of water resources or one of its predecessors or water rights which have previously been adjudicated by a court having jurisdiction of such matters.

      On the day set for the hearing the contestant and such contestees as have filed the affidavit hereinbefore required of them, shall file such affidavits in support of their respective allegations as they may desire, and the department of water resources may require such additional evidence and may make or cause to be made by an engineer whom the department may designate, such personal examination of the work done under the permit in question, as the department may deem necessary to enable it to render a fair decision: provided, that before making or causing such examination to be made the department shall estimate the cost of such examination and shall require the contestant to deposit a sum equal to such estimate and if after the making of such examination it is found that the amount so deposited is in excess of the cost of such examination the department shall return such excess to the contestant. For the purpose of producing additional testimony in making investigations, the department may continue the hearing to such time, not exceeding thirty (30) days, as would seem to it advisable.

     </p>
     <p>
      “bases its claim upon the constitutional method of appropriation. That method requires that the appropriator actually apply the water to a beneficial use. Since the United States has not done so, the district court did not err in denying its claimed water rights.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The court also held that federal ownership or management of the land alone does not qualify it for stockwater rights. It opined:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The United States claimed instream water rights for stock watering based upon its ownership and control of the public lands coupled with the Bureau of Land Management’s comprehensive management of public lands under the Taylor Grazing Act . . . The argument of the United States reflects a misunderstanding of water law . . . As the United States has held, Congress has severed the ownership of federal lands from the ownership of water rights in nonnavigable waters located on such lands.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The court went on to state:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under Idaho Law, a landowner does not own a water right obtained by an appropriator using the land with the landowner’s permission unless the appropriator was acting as agent of the owner in obtaining that water right . . . If the water right was initiated by the lessee, the right is the lessee’s property, unless the lessee was acting as the agent of the owner . . . The Taylor Grazing Act expressly recognizes that ranchers could obtain their own water rights on federal land.”
     </p>
     <p>
      A rancher is not unwittingly acting as an agent of a federal agency simply by grazing livestock on federally managed lands when he files for and receives a stockwater right.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the Legislature to codify and enhance these important points of law from the
    Joyce
    case to protect Idaho stockwater right holders from encroachment by the federal government in navigable and nonnavigable waters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, in order to comply with the
    Joyce
    decision, it is the intent of the Legislature that stockwater rights acquired in a manner contrary to the
    <i>
     Joyce
    </i>
    decision are subject to forfeiture pursuant to sections 42-222(2) and 42-224, Idaho Code.

        As the Rules for Conjunctive Management of Surface and Ground Water Resources (CM Rules) specifically incorporated Idaho law, the failure to recite certain burdens and evidentiary standards, set specific timelines and set objective standards did not make them facially unconstitutional. The CM Rules also survive a facial challenge in the recognition given to partial decrees and in the treatment of carryover water. Am. Falls Reservoir Dist. No. 2 v.

        The director of the Idaho department of water resources may develop and implement a pre-season management plan for allocation of water resources that employs a baseline methodology, which methodology must comport in all respects with the requirements of Idaho’s prior appropriation doctrine, be made available in advance of the applicable irrigation season, and be promptly updated to take into account changing conditions. A senior right holder may initiate a delivery call based on allegations that specified provisions of the management plan will cause it material injury. The party making the call shall specify the respects in which the management plan results in injury to the party. While factual evidence supporting the plan may be considered, along with other evidence in making a determination with regard to the call, the plan by itself shall have no determinative role. Junior right holders affected by the delivery call may respond thereto and shall bear the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the call would be futile or is otherwise unfounded. A determination of the call shall be made by the director of the Idaho department of water resources in a timely and expeditious manner, based on the evidence in the record and the applicable presumptions and burdens of proof.

        Under conjunctive management rule 40.01, when it is found that junior-priority ground water pumping is causing a senior right holder material injury, the director must either: (1) curtail junior-priority ground water pumping to satisfy the senior’s right, or (2) allow out-of-priority diversion of water by junior-priority ground water users, pursuant to a mitigation plan that has been approved by the director. The director must consider whether the mitigation plan provides replacement water supplies or other appropriate compensation to the senior-priority water right, when needed during a time of shortage.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The director of the department of water resources shall divide the state into water districts in such manner that each public stream and tributaries, or independent source of water supply, shall constitute a water district: provided, that any stream or water supply, when the distance between the extreme points of diversion thereon is more than forty (40) miles, may be divided into two (2) or more water districts: provided, that any stream tributary to another stream may be constituted into a separate water district when the use of the water therefrom does not affect or conflict with the rights to the use of the water of the main stream: provided, that any stream may be divided into two (2) or more water districts, irrespective of the distance between the extreme points of diversion, where the use of the waters of such stream by appropriators in one district does not affect or conflict with the use of the waters of such stream by appropriators outside such district: provided, that this section shall not apply to streams or water supplies whose priorities of appropriation have not been adjudicated by the courts having jurisdiction thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director may create, revise the boundaries of, or abolish a water district or combine two (2) or more water districts by entry of an order if such action is required in order to properly administer uses of the water resource. Copies of the order shall be sent by regular mail to all holders of rights to the waters affected by the order. The director’s order is subject to judicial review as provided in section 42-1701A, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before entering an order creating, modifying, or abolishing a district, the director shall, by regular mail, send notice of the proposed action to each water user in the district or proposed district. The notice shall describe the proposed action to be taken, the reasons therefore, the time and place of a hearing to be held concerning the proposed action, and provide a time period within which written comment on the action will be accepted. The hearing shall not be held sooner than ten (10) days after the mailing of the notice, and the written comment period shall not close sooner than ten (10) days after the hearing. Instead of mailing notice, the director may publish notice describing the proposed action, the time and place for the hearing, and the deadline for receiving written comment. The notice shall be published once a week for two (2) weeks in a newspaper or newspapers having general circulation within the district or proposed district, with the second publication appearing at least ten (10) days before the date set for the hearing. The hearing shall be held within the district or proposed district, or at some nearby location convenient to the affected water users.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each water district created hereunder shall be considered an instrumentality of the state of Idaho for the purpose of performing the essential governmental function of distribution of water among appropriators under the laws of the state of Idaho.

In such case, the meeting chairman shall appoint a credentials committee to determine the number of votes each water user present is authorized to cast. If requested, each person present who owns or has the use for the ensuing season of any water right in the stream or water supply comprising such water district that is assessed or proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has been adjudicated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license issued by the department of water resources, shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the average annual dollar amount and any fraction thereof assessed for that person’s qualifying water right for the previous five (5) years, or such lesser number of years as the right has been assessed. If a right has not previously been assessed, a person present who owns or has the use of the right for the ensuing season shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the dollar amount and any fraction thereof that the right would have been assessed had it existed and been reasonably used when water was available under the priority of the right during the previous season. Absentee voting and voting by proxy are prohibited.
    (5) At such meeting, the water users shall choose a meeting chairman and meeting secretary. The water users of any water district that collects or pays district expenses in accordance with section 42-613(3) or 42-619, Idaho Code, shall also elect a water district treasurer.

      (6) At such meeting, the water users may choose an advisory committee to be composed of members selected as may be determined at the meeting, which committee shall serve as advisors to the director and the watermaster in matters pertaining to the distribution of water within the district. The advisory committee may be authorized to carry out policies as set forth in resolutions duly adopted by the water users at the annual meeting or at a special meeting. The advisory committee may also serve as the local committee to facilitate the rental of stored water if appointed by the water resource board for such purpose under the provisions of section 42-1765, Idaho Code.

      (10) Before entering upon the duties of the watermaster’s office, said watermaster shall take and subscribe to an oath before some officer authorized by the laws of the state to administer oaths, to faithfully perform the duties of the watermaster’s office, as provided in section 42-607, Idaho Code, and shall file that oath with the department of water resources. Upon appointment by the director, the actions taken by a watermaster in fulfillment of the duties of the office are covered by the state group surety bond as provided by sections 59-801 through 59-804, Idaho Code. A duly appointed watermaster that is reelected in consecutive years shall not be required to take and file additional oaths with the department of water resources for each consecutive year the watermaster is reelected. If a duly elected or appointed watermaster resigns, dies or is physically unable to perform the duties of the office during the remainder of the elected or appointed watermaster term of service, then the director is authorized to appoint a successor for the unexpired term as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.
    (a) If a water district advisory committee has been chosen as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the water district advisory committee shall meet to either nominate a successor watermaster or request a special meeting as provided in subsection (11) of this section to elect a new watermaster. Upon receipt of a nomination from a majority of the members of the water district advisory committee, the director is authorized to appoint the nominated successor watermaster for the unexpired term.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) If a water district advisory committee has not been chosen, the director of the department of water resources is authorized to appoint a temporary successor watermaster. The temporary appointment extends through the unexpired term unless a special meeting is requested as provided in subsection (11) of this section and water users elect a new watermaster.
     </p>
     <p>
      (11) The director shall call a special meeting of the water district upon receipt of a written request for such meeting from a majority of the members of the advisory committee for a district, a written request from water users representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the votes cast at the last regular annual meeting, a written request from the watermaster, or on the director’s own motion if the director determines a meeting is necessary to address matters that cannot be delayed until the next regular annual meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the special meeting shall be given by the director in the manner provided in subsection (2) of this section, provided however, that a special meeting notice shall be sent at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting date.
     </p>
     <p>
      (12) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to acquire, hold and dispose of such real and personal property, equipment and facilities in the name of the water district as necessary for the proper distribution of water, administration of the water district and enhancement of water supplies and shall provide that all such real and personal property shall remain in the custody of the watermaster and the watermaster’s successor.
     </p>
     <p>
      (13) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to develop, coordinate or provide, through contract or by other means, for weather modification projects involving cloud seeding that are designed to increase the water supplies of the water district by enhancing natural precipitation and which conform to state water planning objectives.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c06s42-605Aol11">
       Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the setting of annual water district assessments and the voting of permitted, licensed and decreed water rights administered by the watermaster solely for nonconsumptive purposes shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. For purposes of this chapter, a water right is nonconsumptive if so designated by provisions of the permit or license issued by the department of water resources, or otherwise so designated by the director, or by decree of the court allowing use of the right to continue when the diversion of earlier priority water rights from the same source has been reduced or stopped by action of the watermaster.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c06s42-605Aol12">
       A nonconsumptive water right is subject to the provisions of this section if water is taken into man-made facilities for beneficial use whether or not the water leaves the river or stream channel. Instream flow water rights held in the name of governmental entities or agencies for the protection of fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty, transportation and navigation values, and water quality shall be exempt from the payment of assessments and the rights shall not be voted. The procedure for collection and payment of the assessments shall be the same as used for consumptive water rights under this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c06s42-605Aol13">
       In preparing the next year’s budget, the watermaster shall determine an assessment for the ensuing year for each water right used solely for nonconsumptive purposes. The assessment shall be sufficient to pay the additional costs and expenses for watermaster services for data collection, water measurement, delivery of water, and record keeping directly attributable to delivery of the water right.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c06s42-605Aol14">
       The assessment shall not become final until adopted as part of the water district budget at the annual meeting of water users in accordance with section 42-612, Idaho Code. The assessment shall not exceed an amount necessary to pay for watermaster services associated with the nonconsumptive right. Nothing in this section shall affect the right, under section 42-612, Idaho Code, of the water users at the annual meeting to provide by resolution for a minimum charge for watermaster services, except as to those instream flow rights exempt from the payment of assessments under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c06s42-605Aol15">
       The holder of a water right assessed under the provisions of this section who desires to contest the amount of an assessment for a nonconsumptive water right shall file a written petition with the director of the department of water resources stating the grounds for contesting the assessment and requesting a hearing. The petition must be filed with the director within thirty (30) days after the billing is mailed to the holder of the water right as provided in section 42-613, Idaho Code. The hearing before the director and any judicial review thereof shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 42-1701A, Idaho Code. The filing of a petition under this section shall not relieve the holder of a nonconsumptive water right from the obligation to pay the assessment when due and payable. The amount of any excessive or deficient assessment determined by a final order of the director shall be credited or collected in the succeeding year in the manner provided under section 42-606, Idaho Code.
    (6) At water district meetings, each person present holding a water right used solely for nonconsumptive purposes shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the average dollar amount and any fraction thereof assessed in accordance with subsection (3) of this section for that person’s qualifying nonconsumptive water right for the previous five (5) years, or such lesser number of years as the right has been assessed in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. If a nonconsumptive right has not been assessed in previous years using subsection (3) of this section, a person present owning or having the use of the right for the ensuing season shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the dollar amount and any fraction thereof which the right is assessed under subsection (3) of this section for the ensuing season.

       <p>
        The right of priority to water in time of shortage, given under this section, may be abandoned. Graham v. Leek, 65 Idaho 279, 144 P.2d 475 (1944).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although this section does not provide for notice and hearing prior to the shutting off of unadjudicated water rights, it is not in violation of procedural due process, since the need to restrict the use of water in times of shortage constitutes an extraordinary circumstance where valid governmental interest justifies the postponement of notice and hearing. Nettleton v. Higginson, 98 Idaho 87, 558 P.2d 1048 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since private water rights cannot be adequately protected unless the watermaster has specific record of the users’ priority dates, use and points of diversion through adjudication of licensing, the preference granted to users with adjudicated or licensed rights by this section does not constitute an unconstitutional denial of equal protection to users with unadjudicated “constitutional use” water rights. Nettleton v. Higginson, 98 Idaho 87, 558 P.2d 1048 (1977).

        This section is intended to make the watermaster’s authority more certain, duties less difficult, and decisions less controversial; however, this section does not apply outside its own language to subordinate constitutional water rights for all purposes, it does not authorize one water user unilaterally to interfere with another’s superior rights, and it is not applicable to private disputes.

        Watermaster could not be required to go beyond provisions of decree to ascertain whether or not the same was supported by findings or whether there was a conflict between the findings and decree, but he could look only to the decree for his instructions as to the amount of water to be distributed to each claimant.

        Holders of water rights are entitled to presume that a watermaster, who is authorized to distribute water only in compliance with applicable decrees, is delivering water to them in compliance with the priorities expressed in the governing decree, and unless holder of water right was aware that he was not receiving water from the watermaster in accordance with his decreed right, that right could not be lost through estoppel, the element of knowing acquiescence being lacking.

        Preference During Scarcity.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where water rights of parties have been adjudicated, it is duty of watermaster during scarcity of water to treat unadjudicated rights as inferior and subordinate to decreed rights. Big Wood Canal Co. v. Chapman, 45 Idaho 380, 263 P. 45 (1927); State v. Hall, 90 Idaho 478, 413 P.2d 685 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the right of appropriation does not carry with it an unconditional guarantee of water regardless of the supply of water available, the fact that the diversion belonging to a holder of an appropriated constitutional use water right must be shut off to allow those with priority to receive water does not justify a contention that private property has been taken for public use without just compensation contrary to<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art. I, § 14.</cite> Nettleton v. Higginson, 98 Idaho 87, 558 P.2d 1048 (1977).

       </p>
       <p>
        The watermaster is not the agent of the water company or water user, but is a ministerial officer. Jones v. Big Lost River Irrigation Dist., 93 Idaho 227, 459 P.2d 1009 (1969).

       <p>
        The 1969 amendment to this section deleting the preference of adjudicated water rights over unadjudicated water rights in times of water scarcity divested the watermaster of control and jurisdiction over unadjudicated water rights, and state reclamation engineer (now the director of department of water resources) and watermaster were properly enjoined from interfering with water diversion by plaintiff who claimed water right by constitutional appropriation.

       The appropriators or users of any public waters of the state of Idaho shall maintain to the satisfaction of the director of the department of water resources suitable headgates and controlling works at the point where the water is diverted. Each device shall be of such construction that it can be locked and kept closed by the watermaster or other officer in charge, and shall also be of such construction as to regulate the flow of water at the diversion point. Each such appropriator shall construct and maintain, when required by the director of the department of water resources, a rating flume or other measuring device at such point as is most practical in such canal, ditch, wellhead or pipeline for the purpose of assisting the watermaster or department in determining the amount of water that may be diverted into said canal, ditch, wellhead or pipeline from the stream, well or other source of public water. Plans for such headgates, rating flumes or other measuring devices shall be approved by the department of water resources.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the owner of a reservoir shall desire to use the bed of a stream, or a natural water course, for the purpose of carrying stored water, he shall in writing notify the department of water resources, giving the date when it is proposed to discharge the water, its volume in acre feet, and in cubic feet per second at the point of discharge, and the persons and ditches entitled to its use. The department shall then appoint a special deputy, unless a state watermaster has already been appointed to deliver the waters from said stream, in which event the appointed watermaster and his assistants may be instructed to make the delivery of the stored water without further appointment, whose duty it shall be to adjust the headgates of all ditches not entitled to the stored water, and in such manner that those having the right to the use of such water shall secure the volume to which they are entitled. For the purpose of delivering such stored water the deputy appointed by the department of water resources may employ such number of assistants as, with the approval of the department, he may deem necessary. The owner of any reservoir proceeding under the provisions of this section shall pay to the special deputy and to each assistant a salary as determined by the director of the department of water resources, or a salary and expenses as negotiated with the owner of the said stored water and approved by the director of the department of water resources, or pay to the water district, if there is one, a sum based upon the cost of delivering a unit of water. Said charge by the water district will be determined and collected in the same manner as prescribed in chapter 6, title 42, Idaho Code, for compensating the watermaster for delivery of natural flow water.

        Idaho Const., Art. XV, § 3, providing that right to appropriate unappropriated waters of a natural stream to a beneficial use shall never be denied, applies to right to use of such stream as highway to carry storage water from a reservoir. Twin Falls Canal Co. v. American Falls Reservoir Dist. No. 2, 49 F.2d 632 (D. Idaho 1931), cert. denied, 287 U.S. 638, 53 S. Ct. 87, 77 L. Ed. 552 (1932). Dams.

        Where plaintiff constructed a dam which resulted in the backing up of water to height which others could utilize, he could not compel reservoir district, diverting storage water from such stream, to contribute to the initial cost of constructing dam.

        An easement which granted a power company the right to fluctuate the flow of a river would be construed as granting something in addition to the right of the power company to fill completely the natural channel of the river, since the power company had the latter right without the aid of an easement.

        Where defendant built a series of dams that increased the flow of a river to such extent that plaintiff’s access to his farm land was obstructed and plaintiff sought to recover damages on the theory that the dams constituted a nuisance, court held that, by statute, defendant and other appropriators of water for lawful purposes had right to use channel of natural streams for carrying stored water or water diverted from other streams. Johnson v. Utah Power & Light Co., 215 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1954).

        The current of a river cannot be appropriated by a riparian proprietor in Idaho, even assuming the possible persistence in that state of the doctrine of riparian rights, in view of statutes declaring the right of appropriators of water for irrigation or other lawful purpose to use the channel of natural streams for carrying stored water or water diverted from other streams.

      After the special deputy and his assistants shall have adjusted the headgates of all ditches, the owners of which are not entitled to the use of such stored water as provided in the preceding section and before such stored water shall have passed the headgates so adjusted, any person who shall raise or tamper with any such headgate in such manner as to misappropriate any portion of such water to his own use and benefit whether he be the owner of such headgate or not, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100 together with imprisonment in the county jail for ten (10) days; and not more than $2000 or by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any ditch, canal or reservoir delivering or distributing water to several users has one or more rights or priorities by reason of enlargements made from time to time, the right of the land being irrigated by such works shall be divided into classes; rights of the first class belonging to those lands reclaimed between the dates of the first and second priorities or rights of such works; rights of the second class belonging to those lands reclaimed between the dates of the second and third priorities of such works; rights of any other class being determined in like manner; but all the rights belonging to the same class shall be equal and subject alike to the regulations of their respective class.

      If two (2) or more parties taking water from any main ditch, canal or reservoir at the same point to be conveyed to their respective premises for any distance, through the same lateral or distributing ditch, do not select a manager for said lateral, as provided in section 42-907[, Idaho Code,] or section 42-908[, Idaho Code], the watermaster of the water district, shall on the written demand of any one or more of said parties, appoint a manager for said lateral, who shall have and exercise all the powers and perform all of the duties of a manager of the distributing lateral as provided in section 42-910[, Idaho Code]: provided, that if an irrigation district is owner of the main ditch, canal or reservoir, then the board of directors of such district shall, upon such demand, make such appointment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation of said manager shall be fixed by said watermaster, and shall be paid in the manner provided by section 42-910[, Idaho Code,] for the payment of expenses incurred by him. If not paid, it may be collected, with other damages in the action provided by said section: provided, that if an irrigation district is the owner of the main ditch, canal or reservoir, the board of directors of such district shall fix the compensation of said manager; and at the end of the irrigation season upon the request of such manager the secretary of such district shall prorate the amount of such compensation among the several parties taking water through such lateral, or distributing ditch upon the basis of the number of acres irrigated by each, and mail each a statement of the amount prorated to such party, requesting that remittance be made to such secretary for and on behalf of such manager. In the event such parties or either of them, not later than the date when irrigation district assessments are delinquent, remit to such secretary, he shall, upon receiving same, and without making any entry in his books of account, deliver it to such manager. Should such parties or either of them fail or refuse at such time to remit to said secretary, then such manager may collect as hereinbefore provided.

        By reading this section into a water contract, water user is entitled to receive amount of water specified in his contract to the extent necessary to irrigate the crop or crops which he cultivates in accordance with the usages of good husbandry, but he is not entitled to receive a greater amount than is necessary to irrigate his crops, nor, in any event, a greater amount than that specified in the contract. State v. Twin Falls Salmon River Land & Water Co., 30 Idaho 41, 166 P. 220 (1916).

        Provision that water user must not use more water than good husbandry requires is read into Carey Act contracts. Idaho Irrigation Co. v. Gooding, 265 U.S. 518, 44 S. Ct. 618, 68 L. Ed. 1157 (1924); Sallee v. Commonwealth Trust Co., 8 F.2d 227 (9th Cir. 1925).

        Duty of careful and economical use of water is one that by statute as well as public policy is imposed upon every water user. State v. Twin Falls Canal Co., 21 Idaho 410, 121 P. 1039 (1911), error dismissed, 235 U.S. 690, 35 S. Ct. 205, 59 L. Ed. 427 (1914).

        It is against the public policy of state, as well as against express enactments, for a water user to take more of the water to which he is entitled than is necessary for the beneficial use for which he has appropriated it. Glavin v. Salmon River Canal Co., 44 Idaho 583, 258 P. 532 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since it is the policy of the law of Idaho to prevent the wasting of water, at such times during the irrigation season as water is not being used and beneficially applied, other users are entitled to use and beneficially apply such water.

        In the dissenting opinion this section was cited in support of the application of the doctrine of riparian rights to the irrigation law, but the majority of the court, without citing this section, declared, in effect, that the doctrine of riparian rights has no place in the jurisprudence of this state.

      § 42-1102. Owners of land — Right to right-of-way.
     </h3>
     <p>
      When any such owners or claimants to land have not sufficient length of frontage on a stream to afford the requisite fall for a ditch, canal or other conduit on their own premises for the proper irrigation thereof, or where the land proposed to be irrigated is back from the banks of such stream, and convenient facilities otherwise for the watering of said lands cannot be had, such owners or claimants are entitled to a right-of-way through the lands of others, for the purposes of irrigation. The right-of-way shall include, but is not limited to, the right to enter the land across which the right-of-way extends for the purposes of cleaning, maintaining and repairing the ditch, canal or conduit, and to occupy such width of the land along the banks of the ditch, canal or conduit as is necessary to properly do the work of cleaning, maintaining and repairing the ditch, canal or conduit with personnel and with such equipment as is commonly used or is reasonably adapted to that work. The right-of-way also includes the right to remove from and to deposit on the banks of the ditch or canal the debris, vegetation, and other matter necessarily required to be taken from the ditch, canal, or right-of-way to properly access, clean, and maintain them, but no greater width of land along the banks of the canal or ditch than is absolutely necessary for such deposits shall be occupied by the removed debris, vegetation, or other matter. The right-of-way also includes the right to remove or control vegetation within the ditch or canal or along the banks of the ditch or canal to properly access, clean, and maintain them, but the owner or operator of the ditch, canal, or conduit is not obligated to maintain or control the right-of-way or vegetation for the benefit of the owners or claimants of lands of others. Provided that in the making, constructing, keeping up and maintenance of such ditch, canal or conduit, through the lands of others, the person, company or corporation, proceeding under this section, and those succeeding to the interests of such person, company or corporation must keep such ditch, canal or other conduit in good repair and are liable to the owners or claimants of the lands crossed by such work or aqueduct for all damages occasioned by the overflow thereof, or resulting from any neglect or accident (unless the same be unavoidable) to such ditch or aqueduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      The existence of a visible ditch, canal or conduit shall constitute notice to the owner, or any subsequent purchaser, of the underlying servient estate, that the owner of the ditch, canal or conduit has the right-of-way and incidental rights confirmed or granted by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rights-of-way provided by this section are essential for the operations of the ditches, canals and conduits. No person or entity shall cause or permit any encroachments onto the right-of-way, including public or private roads, utilities, fences, gates, pipelines, structures, landscaping, trees, vegetation, or other construction or placement of objects, without the written permission of the owner or operator of the right-of-way, in order to ensure that any such encroachments will not unreasonably or materially interfere with the use and enjoyment of the right-of-way. Encroachments of any kind placed in such right-of-way without express written permission of the owner or operator of the right-of-way shall be removed at the expense of the person or entity causing or permitting such encroachment, upon the request of the owner or operator of the right-of-way, in the event that any such encroachments unreasonably or materially interfere with the use and enjoyment of the right-of-way. Nothing in this section shall in any way affect the exercise of the right of eminent domain for the public purposes set forth in section 7-701, Idaho Code.
    This section shall apply to ditches, canals or other conduits existing on the effective date of this act, as well as to ditches, canals or other conduits constructed after such effective date.

       <p>
        Where an owner of land was denied access for irrigation water across the lands of an adjacent landowner, the owner could condemn a right of way to supply the water under the law of eminent domain. White v. Marty, 97 Idaho 85, 540 P.2d 270 (1975), overruled on other grounds, Carr v. Magistrate Court, 108 Idaho 546, 700 P.2d 949 (1985).

        Landlocked individuals may condemn a right of way through the lands of others for purposes of irrigation. Canyon View Irrigation Co. v. Twin Falls Canal Co., 101 Idaho 604, 619 P.2d 122 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 1983, 68 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1981).

        If the servient estate landowner’s use of irrigation ditch had increased the cost of repairs and maintenance, he would have been responsible for the additional costs; but since his use did not increase those costs, he had no obligation to pay for any portion of those costs.

       <p>
        Where irrigation district sought an injunction to prohibit servient owner from constructing a sidewalk and fence on property over which the district had an irrigation easement, it was determined that the irrigation district’s easement was not exclusive, and the district failed to produce evidence showing that construction of the sidewalk and fence along the side of the irrigation lateral would unreasonably interfere with its rights under the easement, regardless of whether those rights arose from the grant of the channel change easement or this section. Nampa & Meridian Irrigation Dist. v. Washington Fed. Sav., 135 Idaho 518, 20 P.3d 702 (2001), overruled on other grounds, Idaho Military Historical Soc’y, Inc. v. Maslen, 156 Idaho 624, 329 P.3d 1072 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Irrigation district does not enjoy exclusive rights in its primary easements and rights-of-way. Rather, this section only contemplates a right-of-way for cleaning, maintaining, and repairing canals. This section provides notice to owners of land that the owner of the ditch or canal has the right-of-way, and serves to clarify what the right-of-way includes. Pioneer Irrigation Dist. v. City of Caldwell, 153 Idaho 593, 288 P.3d 810 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by determining that an irrigation district owned a right-of-way along an irrigation canal that ran the entire length of an owners’ property and that the right-of-way commenced at the top of the bank before the bank began its descent to the water, where portions of the owner’s property stretched out flat from the top of the bank. The right-of-way commenced from the outside toe of the berm levy or bank, where the land began to level out where portions of the owner’s property abutting the canal were bermed or levied. Morgan v. New Swed. Irrigation Dist., 160 Idaho 47, 368 P.3d 990 (2016).

        Where there was conflicting evidence concerning the adequacy of water supply and the court might have inferred that the water shortage resulted from construction defects in new ditch, but also could have inferred that the shortage was attributable to such other causes as lack of maintenance, for which the defendant contractor was not responsible, the court’s determination, under Idaho R. Civ. P. 41(b) motion for involuntary dismissal, that the plaintiff landowners failed to prove a right to damages resulting from alteration of an irrigation ditch by a highway construction contractor, was proper.

      The owner, owners, and operators of any irrigating ditch, canal or conduit shall carefully keep and maintain the embankments thereof in good repair, in order to prevent the water from wasting during the irrigation season, and shall not at any time permit a greater quantity of water to be turned into said ditch, canal or conduit than the banks thereof will easily contain or than can be used for beneficial or useful purposes; it being the meaning of this section to prevent the wasting and useless discharge and running away of water.

      The owners, constructors, or operators of ditches, canals, works or other aqueducts, and their successors in interest, using and employing the same to convey the waters of any stream or spring, whether the said ditches, canals, works or aqueducts be upon the lands owned or claimed by them, or upon other lands, must carefully keep and maintain the same, and the embankments, flumes or other conduits, by which such waters are or may be conducted, in good repair and condition, so as not to damage or in any way injure the property or premises of others. The duties referenced in this section, whether statutory or common law, require reasonable care only and shall not be construed to impose strict liability or to otherwise enlarge the liability of the owner, owners, or operators of any irrigating ditch, canal, works or other aqueduct. The owners, constructors, or operators of such ditches, canals, works or other aqueducts, while responsible for their own acts or omissions, shall not be liable for damage or injury caused by: (1) The diversion or discharge of water into a ditch, canal, works or other aqueduct by a third party without the permission of the owner, owners, or operators of the ditch, canal, works or other aqueduct; (2) Any other act or omission of a third party, other than an employee or agent of the owner, owners, or operators of the ditch, canal, works or other aqueduct; or (3) An act of God, including fire, earthquake, storm or similar natural phenomenon. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to impair any defense that an owner, constructor, or operator of a ditch, canal, works or other aqueduct may assert in a civil action. The owners, constructors, or operators have the right to enter the land across which the right-of-way extends, for the purposes of cleaning, maintaining and repairing the ditch, canal or conduit, and to occupy such width of the land along the banks of the ditch, canal or conduit as is necessary to properly do the work of cleaning, maintaining and repairing the ditch, canal or conduit with personnel and with such equipment as is commonly used or is reasonably adapted to that work. The right-of-way also includes the right to remove from and to deposit on the banks of the ditch or canal the debris, vegetation, and other matter necessarily required to be taken from the ditch, canal, or from the right-of-way to properly clean and maintain them, but no greater width of land along the banks of the canal or ditch than is absolutely necessary for such deposits shall be occupied by the removed debris, vegetation, or other matter. The right-of-way also includes the right to remove or control vegetation within the ditch or canal or along the banks of the ditch or canal to properly access, clean, and maintain them, but the owner or operator of the ditch, canal, or conduit is not obligated to maintain or control the right-of-way or vegetation for the benefit of the owners or claimants of lands of others.

       </p>
       <p>
        In action brought to recover damages for injury to a crop of potatoes, a finding by the jury of negligence on the appellant’s part in maintaining the lateral was justified where either water in some considerable quantity, more than the lateral could safely carry, was emptied into the lateral while checked and backed up by flash boards, causing the banks of the lateral to overflow and break, or seepage through a gopher hole enlarged to a stream sufficient to break the bank of the lateral. Johnson v. Burley Irrigation Dist., 78 Idaho 392, 304 P.2d 912 (1956).
    The owner of an irrigation canal was liable for property damage resulting from water from the canal seeping into the residence basement of an abutting property owner. Harris v. Preston-Whitney Irrigation Co., 92 Idaho 398, 443 P.2d 482 (1968).

        In landowners’ action for damages for injury to property caused by flooding which resulted when irrigation district’s canal bank broke, an engineer’s testimony that the break was caused by a combination of factors including inadequate design, poor construction procedures, and gopher holes penetrating the embankment supported the trial court’s findings that the canal would not have broken in the absence of negligence and that the irrigation district was thereby liable.

      All owners of any ditch, canal or conduit, or any other means for conveying water, shall build substantial bridges not less than sixteen (16) feet wide, and with boards not less than two (2) inches in thickness (unless the same shall be on a county or state road, when such boards shall not be less than three (3) inches thick), at all places where any county or state road crosses the same, or any road kept open and used by any neighborhood of people for their benefit and convenience.

       <p>
        Where any ditch, canal, lateral or drain or buried irrigation conduit has heretofore been, or may hereafter be, constructed across or beneath the lands of another, the person or persons owning or controlling said land shall have the right at their own expense to change said ditch, canal, lateral or drain or buried irrigation conduit to any other part of said land, but such change must be made in such a manner as not to impede the flow of the water therein, or to otherwise injure any person or persons using or interested in such ditch, canal, lateral or drain or buried irrigation conduit. Any increased operation and maintenance shall be the responsibility of the landowner who makes the change, his heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
       </p>
       <p>
        A landowner shall also have the right to bury the ditch, canal, lateral or drain of another in pipe on the landowner’s property, provided that the pipe, installation and backfill reasonably meet standard specifications for such materials and construction, as set forth in the Idaho standards for public works construction or other standards recognized by the city or county in which the burying is to be done. The right and responsibility for operation and maintenance shall remain with the owner of the ditch, canal, lateral or drain, but the landowner, his heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns shall be responsible for any increased operation and maintenance costs, including rehabilitation and replacement, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the owner.
       </p>
       <p>
        The written permission of the owner or operator of a ditch, canal, lateral, drain or buried irrigation conduit must first be obtained before it is changed or placed in buried pipe by the landowner.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the owner or operator of a ditch, canal, lateral, drain or buried irrigation conduit shall have no right to relocate it on the property of another without permission, a ditch, canal, lateral or drain owner or operator shall have the right to place it in a buried conduit within the easement or right-of-way on the property of another in accordance with standard specifications for pipe, materials, installation and backfill, as set forth in the Idaho standards for public works construction or other standards recognized by the city or county in which the burying is to be done, and as long as the pipe and the construction is accomplished in a manner that the surface of the owner’s property and the owner’s use thereof is not disrupted and is restored to the condition of adjacent property as expeditiously as possible, but no longer than thirty (30) days after the completion of construction. A landowner shall have the right to direct that the conduit be relocated to a different route than the route of the ditch, canal, lateral or drain, provided that the landowner, his heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns shall be responsible for any increased construction or future maintenance costs necessitated by said relocation. Maintenance of the buried conduit shall be the responsibility of the conduit owner or operator.

        Where there was conflicting evidence concerning the adequacy of water supply and the court might have inferred that the water shortage resulted from construction defects in new ditch, but also could have inferred that the shortage was attributable to such other causes as lack of maintenance, for which the defendant contractor was not responsible, the court’s determination, under an Idaho R. Civ. P. 41(b) motion for involuntary dismissal, that the plaintiff landowners failed to prove a right to damages resulting from alteration of an irrigation ditch by a highway construction contractor, was proper.

        As the holder of the ditch right, the dominant estate owner may make changes to an irrigation ditch easement, so long as the changes do not increase the burden on the servient land, even if those changes remove an incidental benefit to the servient estate holder.

        This section grants a ditch owner the express right to pipe the ditch under the existing ditch easement or right-of-way. It also implicitly grants the ditch owner the right to pipe the ditch in a location off of the servient land without the servient landowner’s permission, because the statute states that written permission is only required if the ditch is relocated on the servient land. Further, piping the ditch in a location outside the servient land, and thus removing an incidental benefit along with it, is well within the rights of a dominant-estate holder. Zingiber Inv., LLC v. Hagerman Highway Dist., 150 Idaho 675, 249 P.3d 868 (2011), overruled on other grounds, City of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 277 P.3d 353 (2012).

        A decrease in the amount of water to which users of water from an irrigation ditch are entitled, measured in terms of miners’ inches or c.f.s., may be the best method of establishing that the flow has been impeded, but it is not the only method to prove this occurrence. Ditch rights are determined by the flow of water historically conveyed through the ditch and not necessarily by the amount of water to which its users are entitled under the water laws of this state.

        Where servient estate cut off side ditch used by defendant for part of his water supply, but constructed a new ditch for use of defendant, burden of proof in proceeding to enjoin prosecution for cutting off ditch was on plaintiff to show that new ditch would convey same amount of water as conveyed by old ditch without impeding the flow in the main ditch. Simonson v. Moon, 72 Idaho 39, 237 P.2d 93 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        If change in location of side ditch required rotation in use of water by users of main ditch, there was a substantial impediment in flow of water. Simonson v. Moon, 72 Idaho 39, 237 P.2d 93 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        The installation of the Jamerson pipeline and the diversion works would in nowise change or affect respondent’s easement in the East Ditch, to transmit therein to his land 60 miners inches of water when needed or desired, such installation only changing the location of such easement in an open surface ditch to an underground ditch, such being accomplished through the cooperation of both landowners and by agreement arrived at between them. Ramseyer v. Jamerson, 78 Idaho 504, 305 P.2d 1088 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court failed to recognize the application of this section although the parties themselves had applied the same in compromise and settlement of the controversy regarding appellant’s right to an easement sufficient to accommodate the diagonal lateral over respondent’s land or in lieu thereof, to a corresponding easement for a ditch over respondent’s lands changed to a location at respondent’s expense, different from that of the diagonal lateral. Aguirre v. Hamlin, 80 Idaho 176, 327 P.2d 349 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff did not become entitled to a ditch of greater size and capacity and to an easement therefor, than his original diagonal lateral destroyed by respondent and the easement over respondent’s lands should have been of similar construction as the diagonal lateral, over the route as designated by respondent to a point where the diagonal lateral formerly entered appellant’s property. Aguirre v. Hamlin, 80 Idaho 176, 327 P.2d 349 (1958).
    Where irrigation district entered into agreement with school district to place irrigation ditch in an underground pipe and to construct a cement inlet collar and safety/trash screen for such ditch to be located on the plaintiffs’ property, this section gave the school district the right to place the ditch underground on its property and gave plaintiffs the right to move the cement inlet collar and safety/trash screen to the back of their property where it would be less offensive to them, at their expense, if the requirements of the statute were met. Abbott v. Nampa Sch. Dist. No. 131, 119 Idaho 544, 808 P.2d 1289 (1991).

        Whether liability for diminished water flow was predicated upon negligence, or upon violation of this section, the plaintiff landowners were required to show that relocation of the ditch actually caused a diminished flow of water to their properties since proof of causation is essential to invoke the statute.

        Because a servient estate owner can neither decrease the water flow nor cause injury to the dominant estate, this section protects two distinct property rights — water rights and ditch rights; it protects a dominant estate owner from injuries relating to an impediment to water flow, as well as from any other injuries suffered by the dominant estate owner as a result of the servient estate owner’s interference with the ditch.

      Easements or rights-of-way operated, maintained, controlled or owned by irrigation districts, Carey act operating companies, nonprofit irrigation entities, lateral ditch associations, and drainage districts are essential for the operations of such irrigation and drainage entities. Accordingly, no person or entity shall cause or permit any encroachments onto the easements or rights-of-way, including any public or private roads, utilities, fences, gates, pipelines, structures, landscaping, trees, vegetation, or other construction or placement of objects, without the written permission of the irrigation district, Carey act operating company, nonprofit irrigation entity, lateral ditch association, or drainage district owning, operating, maintaining, or controlling the easement or right-of-way, in order to ensure that any such encroachments will not unreasonably or materially interfere with the use and enjoyment of the easement or right-of-way. Encroachments of any kind placed in such easement or right-of-way, without such express written permission, shall be removed at the expense of the person or entity causing or permitting such encroachments, upon the request of the persons operating, maintaining, or controlling the easement or right-of-way or the owner of the easement or right-of-way, in the event that any such encroachments unreasonably or materially interfere with the use and enjoyment of the easement or right-of-way.

        An irrigation ditch owner is vested with the discretion to determine whether a proposed encroachment would result in unreasonable or material interference with the easement or right-of-way and, based on that exercise of discretion, is vested with the authority to grant or deny a requested encroachment. The ditch owner may take into account the impact of the encroachment, or encroachments, upon the use and enjoyment of the easement or right-of-way. Pioneer Irrigation Dist. v.

        Four conditions must be satisfied before an encroachment “shall” be removed. First, the encroachment must have been constructed after the effective date of this section.

Fourth, the ditch owner must request that the party responsible for the encroachment remove it. Pioneer Irrigation Dist. v. City of Caldwell, 153 Idaho 593, 288 P.3d 810 (2012).

At such annual meetings each water user shall be entitled to one (1) vote in person, for each inch and a fractional vote for each fraction of an inch of water which such water user is entitled to receive from such laterals, and a corporation shall vote by one (1) of its officers designated by it. Such association shall organize by the election of a chairman, vice-chairman and a secretary-treasurer, which officers shall also constitute the board of directors of such association, and shall hold office for one (1) year and until their successors are elected. Such association at the annual meeting shall also elect a manager of said lateral or laterals to be known as “lateral manager” for the succeeding season and shall fix the compensation of said manager, and of all officers. Such association may adopt such rules and regulations for the management of said lateral or laterals or distributing ditch or ditches and the delivery of water therefrom as they deem best, and may, by majority vote, if it be deemed for the best interests of the association, combine one (1) or more laterals and abandon laterals not in use, and do any and all things not in conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the laws of this state wherein the best interests of the association will be furthered.

      In the event that a water users’ association of lateral or laterals has not been constituted on a particular lateral or distributing ditch pursuant to this chapter, any individual water user taking water from a canal or reservoir to be conveyed to their respective premises for any distance through such lateral or distributing ditch may authorize the irrigation delivery entity providing water to the lateral or ditch to perform any necessary repairs, improvements, or maintenance to the lateral or ditch. The irrigation delivery entity may agree to perform such work only if it has duly adopted a bylaw authorizing such work to be done for its individual water users, or adopts a resolution authorizing the work. In performing such work, the irrigation delivery entity shall have the same rights and privileges to enter the land across which the right-of-way extends, for the purposes of cleaning, maintaining and repairing the lateral or ditch, and to perform such work, as does the individual water user authorizing the work. By performing such work, the irrigation delivery entity does not assume ownership of the lateral or ditch, or responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to person or property caused by an act or omission of the individual water user authorizing the work, or of any other person. When such work has been authorized, the irrigation entity shall assess the individual water user for the annual cost of any necessary repairs, improvements, or maintenance performed on the lateral or ditch, in addition to the assessments that are levied for the delivery of water to the individual water user, and the same provisions shall apply with regard to delinquent assessments as in the case of assessments levied for the delivery of water. Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of a water users’ association of lateral or laterals from assessing its members for work authorized under this chapter.

        Section 1 of S.L. 2001, ch. 31, read: “A principal goal of the Legislature is the timely completion of the pending Snake River Basin Adjudication resulting in a judicial determination of all water rights within the Snake River basin in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 14, Title 42, Idaho Code. A recent judicial decision holding that the Snake River Basin Adjudication district court has exclusive jurisdiction to provide judicial review of administrative actions by the Department of Water Resources affecting rights to the use of water in the Snake River basin potentially frustrates this legislative goal.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It is and has been the intention of the Legislature that the district court presiding over a water rights adjudication proceeding under the provisions of Chapter 14, Title 42, Idaho Code, exercises unique jurisdiction over the ‘judicial determination’ of the elements of the water rights subject to the court’s jurisdiction. Further, it is and has been the intention of the Legislature that judicial review of an agency action by the Department of Water Resources under the provisions of Chapter 52, Title 67, Idaho Code, does not provide a judicial determination of the elements of a water right. Rather, a judicial review proceeding potentially results only in confirmation of an administrative determination of one (1) or more elements of a water right, which then shall constitute prima facie evidence of those elements consistent with the provisions of Section 42-220, Idaho Code. In order not to burden and delay the adjudication proceeding with actions for judicial review, the Legislature finds it necessary to enact the following statutory amendment, which is intended to apply to all actions for judicial review pending on the date of enactment as well as future actions.”

       Any claimant may file suit in the district court for the county in which the point of diversion or place of use of the claimed right is located for the purpose of adjudicating rights to the use of water from any water system for which a general adjudication has not been commenced or completed. The claimant shall set forth in his complaint the claimed water right in a notice of claim form furnished by the director. The claimant shall join all claimants of rights to the use of water from the water system whose joinder is necessary to resolve the dispute over rights to the use of water from the water system. The claimant shall also publish notice of the action in the manner specified in subsection (2)(b) of section<cite class="ocid"><a href="#t42c14s42-1408" target="_self">42-1408</a></cite>A [42-1408], Idaho Code.

       Any party who may be injured and who objects to the water right claimed by the claimant shall, within forty-five (45) days of the date of first publication of notice, file with the district court written notice of such objection stating the reasons for the objection. A copy of the objection shall be served upon the claimant, all other parties of record in the action, the watermasters, and the director.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c14s42-1404ol13">
       Any claimant of a right to the use of water from the water system being adjudicated shall be entitled to intervene and have the claimed right adjudicated. Any such claimant requesting intervention shall set forth the claimed water right in a notice of claim form furnished by the director. The court may request a director’s report of the director, as described in section 42-1411, Idaho Code, as to those rights to be determined. The director shall advise the district court as to whether the director will commence an examination of the water system in accordance with the provisions of section 42-1410, Idaho Code. If the director elects not to conduct an examination, the adjudication shall proceed based on the description of the water right in the notice of claim form. Each claimant shall have the burden of proof of establishing each element of a water right described in the claimants notice of claim form.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c14s42-1404ol14">
       The director shall provide to the court an estimate of the costs that will be incurred in conducting the examination and in preparing the director’s report and an approximate time when the director’s report will be completed. The court shall order the claimants of the rights to be determined to submit a notice of claim to the director in accordance with section 42-1409, Idaho Code, except that the fee as described in section 42-1414, Idaho Code, shall not apply. Upon the completion of claims-taking, the director shall bill each claimant for a claim fee equal to that claimant’s proportionate share of the total estimated cost to the state relative to that claimant’s share of the total amount of water claimed by all claimants or for an amount as determined by the court. Any notice of claim for a water right for which the fee is unpaid after thirty (30) days from billing by the director shall be incomplete and may be rejected. Prior to filing of the report with the court, the claimants shall pay the balance of the department’s verified costs or be refunded any unused estimated costs advanced to the department in the same proportion as described above. In the event that a claimant shall contest the department’s costs, the court shall then determine the reasonable costs to be paid by each claimant.

      <li id="t42c14s42-1404ol15">
       Notice of the filing of the director’s report shall be given and objections to the director’s report shall be made and heard as provided in sections 42-1411 and 42-1412, Idaho Code.
    (6) The decree, which shall be entered pursuant to section 42-1412, Idaho Code, shall contain or incorporate a statement of each element of a water right as stated in subsection (2) of section 42-1411, Idaho Code, as applicable. The decree shall also determine all other matters necessary for the efficient administration of the water rights. The decree shall be conclusive as to the rights determined in the proceeding only as to those persons party to the proceeding.

        Until all of the underlying issues of fraud and self-dealing were determined by the trial court there was no determination necessary of any essential element of a water right, and the Snake River adjudication court did not have jurisdiction until the underlying issues were decided.

        Although the parties filed claims to adjudicate their respective right to the real property comprising a water well, neither party filed an action for adjudication of any water rights in compliance with this section; therefore, district court’s order granting exclusive water rights to one party was vacated.

        The Snake River basin adjudication (SRBA) district court is, in effect, a separate division of the district courts and exercises the unique jurisdiction given it by the legislature. Thus, once SRBA has commenced, jurisdiction to resolve all of the water rights claims within the scope of the general adjudication is in the SRBA district court only. Walker v. Big Lost River Irrigation Dist., 124 Idaho 78, 856 P.2d 868 (1993).

        Trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant a writ of mandate and a permanent injunction compelling irrigation district to deliver stored water outside of irrigation district’s boundaries, where the case required the trial court to determine the right to the use of water, which could only be addressed as part of the Snake River Basin Adjudication (SRBA).

        The Snake River basin adjudication (SRBA) district court is, in effect, a separate division of the district courts and exercises the unique jurisdiction given it by the legislature. Thus, once SRBA has commenced, jurisdiction to resolve all of the water rights claims within the scope of the general adjudication is in the SRBA district court only. Walker v.

Separate petitions shall be filed for water rights adjudications for each of the following river basins, and related ground water sources whether or not hydraulically connected to a surface water source, within Idaho: the Coeur d’Alene-Spokane river basin, the Palouse river basin, and the Clark Fork-Pend Oreille river basins, which do not include basin 98. The filing of each petition shall be contingent on legislative funding approval. Each petition shall describe the boundaries of the water source or water sources to be adjudicated.

The clerk of the district court in which the petition is filed shall send to the supreme court a true and certified copy of the petition. The supreme court, by order, shall assign the judge to preside over the general adjudication. Venue of the general adjudication shall be determined by order or rule of the supreme court and venue of hearings under the general adjudication shall be determined by order of the presiding judge.

       Upon entry of a district court’s order commencing a general adjudication, the director shall prepare a notice of order, using plain and concise language, that contains the following information or enclosures:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol11a">

        </li>
        <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol11c">
         that section 42-1409, Idaho Code, requires in a general adjudication all claimants, except as specifically excluded by law, to file for each water right, a notice of claim on a form furnished by the director; failure to file a required notice of claim will result in a court determination that no water right exists for the use of water for which the required notice of claim was not filed;
        </li>
        <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol11d">
         a notice of claim is required for any water right license and for any water right permit on file for which the director requires a permit holder to file a notice of claim in accordance with section 42-1409, Idaho Code; a notice of claim may be filed for any other water right permit;

         a notice of claim, if the court order excludes any uses from an adjudication, may be filed for the excluded use prior to the filing of the director’s report with the district court and the right will be determined, even though a notice of claim is not required;
        </li>
        <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol11g">
         a notice of claim is not required for any person who receives water solely by virtue of ownership of shares of stock in, or by being located within the boundaries of, a water delivery organization, if the water delivery organization holds legal title to the water right and if the water delivery organization files a notice of claim;

         section 42-1414, Idaho Code, requires each claimant, other than those exempted by federal law, to pay a variable fee to the director with a notice of claim; failure to pay the fee will result in rejection of the notice of claim; failure to file a timely notice of claim will result in the assessment of a late fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) or fifteen per cent (15%) of the original filing fee, whichever is greater;
        </li>
        <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol11l">
         section 42-1409, Idaho Code, requires that all purchasers of a water right inquire of the director whether a notice of claim has been filed, and if not, to file a notice of claim, except as specifically excluded by law, and that all claimants and purchasers provide the director written notice of any change in ownership, along with some evidence of ownership or of any change in mailing address; and
        </li>
        <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol11m">

      <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol14">
       Upon expiration of the period for filing notices of claims, the director shall conduct a second round of service in conformance with this subsection. The director shall compare the notices of claims with department records and other information reasonably available to determine whether there are any rights to water from the water system for which no notice of claim was filed. In the event the director determines that not all claimants have filed claims, the director shall make a reasonably diligent effort in accordance with the court order to determine the land to which the possible claim is appurtenant, the last known owner of that land, and the last known address of that owner. The director shall prepare a second round notice of order. The director shall serve this notice on the last known owner in accordance with the court order. The notice shall contain the information specified in subsection (1) of this section, except that the notice shall state a final date for filing notices of claims. The final date shall be an additional period of time, in no case less than ninety (90) days from the date the notice is served, in which the notice of claim must be received by the director.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c14s42-1408ol15">
       The director shall file with the district court such proof of service as may be required to demonstrate compliance with the above requirements.

     <p>
      (b) the director shall serve the notice of order on claimants other than the persons in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section, initially by publication once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in each county in which any part of the water system, which is the subject of the general adjudication, is located. If there is no newspaper published within a county, then the copies shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in that county;
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) the director shall post the notice of order in each county courthouse, county recorder’s office, and county assessor’s office in which any part of the water system is located. The director shall complete the posting on or before the date of the last publication within each county;
     </p>
     <p>
      (d) the director shall serve the notice of order by ordinary mail on each person listed as owning real property on the real property assessment roll within the boundaries of the water system to be adjudicated at the address listed on the real property assessment roll; and
     </p>
     <p>
      (e) the director shall file a copy of the notice of order commencing a general adjudication in the office of the county recorder in each county in which any part of the water system is located; notwithstanding the provisions of section 5-505, Idaho Code, the notice, from the time it is filed with the recorder for record, is constructive notice of the contents thereof within the county in which the notice is recorded, to subsequent purchasers and mortgagees.

        Snake River Basin Adjudication (SRBA) court ruled properly in failing to apply the requirements of Idaho Civil Rule 55(b)(2) to a proceeding removing a water right from a parcel of land, because the default notice provisions of the rule did not apply. The SRBA court’s disallowal of an unclaimed water right was not entered pursuant to that rule, and was not a default judgment; rather, the disallowal was a statutory action that resulted in the water right being lost.

The examination shall continue in a manner and for such a period of time as the director determines is necessary to evaluate the extent and nature of each water right for which a notice of claim under state law has been filed.

If the well or diversion works are located in a building other than an unlocked structure used solely for housing the well or other diversion works in which there is no reasonable expectation of privacy, the employee shall only enter the building in the absence of a court order after requesting and receiving the permission of the claimant or other occupant.

Any party filing an objection to any portion of the director’s report shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence to rebut the director’s report as to all issues raised by the objection. Provided however, that a claimant objecting to the director’s recommended place of use described by a digital boundary or other similar technology shall not be required to produce digital boundary or other similar technology-generated evidence in order to meet the burden provided by this section. Places of use described using digital boundaries or other similar technology-based descriptions shall not be entitled to any greater weight than descriptions by metes and bounds, the number of irrigated acres within each forty (40) acre subdivision, or other method adequate for the description of water rights. Any other party to the proceeding may submit evidence in opposition to the objector’s position and in support of the director’s report. All such proceedings shall be governed by the Idaho rules of civil procedure and Idaho rules of evidence.

The director shall also serve on each claimant or the claimant’s attorney whose water right is listed in the director’s report a notice of filing of the director’s report. Notice shall be sent to the last known address of the claimant or the claimant’s attorney. The notice shall be prepared by the director using plain and concise language and shall include:

        This section makes it clear that the claimant bears both the burden of production as well as the burden of proof as to each element of a claimed water right. State v. Hagerman Water Right Owners, Inc., 130 Idaho 736, 947 P.2d 409 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a Snake river basin adjudication, the district court did not err in accepting a master’s findings of fact, concerning two priority dates, because the city had not met its burden of proof under subsections (4) and (5) to show when the water was first applied to a beneficial use and the amount so applied. City of Pocatello v. State (In re SRBA Case No. 39576), 152 Idaho 830, 275 P.3d 845 (2012).

       <p>
        The special master did not rely upon the prima facie status of the director’s report, rather, the record indicated that she based her conclusions of forfeiture and abandonment on the facts of the case as applied to both statutory and common law. McCray v. Rosenkrance, 135 Idaho 509, 20 P.3d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Property owners waived the right to challenge a special master’s findings, which were ordered in a partial decree, when they failed to file a motion to alter or amend the recommendations, pursuant to Snake River Basin Adjudication Administrative Order 1, § 13(a). Because there was no notice of challenge, the district court rightly deduced that both parties agreed with the priority date within the special master’s recommendation. Holden v. Weece (In re SRBA Case No. 39576), 163 Idaho 393, 414 P.3d 215 (2018).

        A general provision is an administrative provision that generally applies to water rights, but it need not apply to every water right. A & B Irrigation Dist. v. Idaho Conservation League, 131 Idaho 411, 958 P.2d 568 (1998).

       <p>
        While Idaho Const., Art. II prohibits the legislature from usurping powers properly belonging to the judicial department, it also prohibits the judiciary from improperly invading the province of the legislature; thus, the 1994 legislative revisions and amendments to the Snake River basin adjudication (SRBA) statutes, which redefined the role of the director of the Idaho department of water resources and the role of various state agencies in the SRBA, were a proper exercise of legislative authority to the extent that the statutes prescribe substantive law and do not conflict with rules of the court. State ex rel. Higginson v. United States, 128 Idaho 246, 912 P.2d 614 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was within the legislature’s power to enact subdivision (4) of this section, which directs that the contents of the director of the Idaho department of water resources report shall constitute prima facie evidence of some water rights claims; this direction is recognized in Idaho Evid. R. 301 to create an evidentiary presumption, and unless that evidentiary presumption is overcome by the evidence or the application of that presumption is clearly erroneous on its face, the facts set forth in the director’s report are established. State ex rel. Higginson v. United States, 128 Idaho 246, 912 P.2d 614 (1995).

       <p>
        While affidavits may dispel the presumed correctness of the facts contained in the report, the facts contained therein still exist as facts. Facts contained in the affidavits create triable issues to the extent they conflict with facts alleged in the report. Once the presumption is rebutted, it disappears and the facts upon which the presumption is based are weighed with all other facts may be relevant. State v.

       <p>
        A water right is defined, not in terms of metes and bounds as in other real property, but in terms of the priority, amount, season of use, purpose of use, point of diversion, and place of use; a compromise, in a stipulation to settle a water rights dispute, to change or exchange any of these definitional factors would be identical to a compromise to change or exchange a portion of the metes and bounds description of real property and, as such, would fall directly within the statute of frauds.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where oral stipulation to settle water rights dispute changed existing water rights by reshuffling priority dates and changing amounts of use, such stipulation was a contract falling within the statute of frauds and, if still executory, was unenforceable.

        While Idaho Const., Art. II prohibits the legislature from usurping powers properly belonging to the judicial department, it also prohibits the judiciary from improperly invading the province of the legislature; thus, the 1994 legislative revisions and amendments to the Snake River basin adjudication (SRBA) statutes, which redefined the role of the director of the Idaho department of water resources and the role of various state agencies in the SRBA, were a proper exercise of legislative authority to the extent that the statutes prescribe substantive law and do not conflict with rules of the court.

        The provision of former law that claimants shall file objections within 60 days requires the district courts to hear objections raised within that time period but leaves them with discretion to hear objections thereafter. Branson v. Miracle, 107 Idaho 221, 687 P.2d 1348 (1984).

        Since the provision of former law requiring affirmance where no objection has been filed does not require affirmance where the claimant has failed to object within 60 days, but only where the claimant has failed to raise any objections, the court did not err in exercising its discretion in allowing parties to present objections to the report after the 60-day period had elapsed.

       Within any critical ground water area designated pursuant to section 42-233a, Idaho Code, a claim to the expanded use of a ground water right, which use was expanded in violation of the mandatory permit requirements, may be decreed in a general water rights adjudication if the expansion occurred after the designation of the critical ground water area, before the commencement of the adjudication, and before the date of enactment of this section.

       If the director finds that an adequate management program to bring withdrawals into balance with recharge does not exist, the director shall order all holders of rights to expanded use of ground water within the area to cease or reduce withdrawal of water until such time as the director determines that withdrawals have been brought into balance with recharge and sufficient ground water is available to resume or increase withdrawals.

        Snake River Basin Adjudication (SRBA) court ruled properly in failing to apply the requirements of Idaho Civil Rule 55(b)(2) to a proceeding removing a water right from a parcel of land, because the default notice provisions of the rule did not apply. The SRBA court’s disallowal of an unclaimed water right was not entered pursuant to that rule, and was not a default judgment; rather, the disallowal was a statutory action that resulted in the water right being lost.

        Decrees entered in a general adjudication shall be conclusive as to the nature and extent of all water rights in the adjudicated water system. A private settlement agreement cannot define, add, or subtract from the elements of a validly adjudicated water right. It can only limit, condition, or clarify the administration of the right as between the private parties to the agreement. City of Blackfoot v. Spackman, 162 Idaho 302, 396 P.3d 1184 (2017).

        A petition for judicial review of an order by the director of the Idaho department of water resources affecting water use and rights was not an appropriate forum to reinterpret the scope of partial decrees entered in the Snake River Basin Adjudication (SRBA), because any interpretation inconsistent with the plain language of the decrees would impact the certainty and finality of the SRBA judgments. Requests for such interpretations must be made in the SRBA itself. Rangen, Inc. v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Res. (In re Distrib. of Water to Water Right Nos. 36-02551 &amp; 36-07694 (Rangen, Inc.)

        In action for adjudication of priorities in well waters tributary to lake, complaint was not demurrable because of failure to join all users of water from lake as defendants since users not party to action were not bound by provisions of statute authorizing action and could not be injured by judgment therein, while intervening users had an ample opportunity to protect their rights as if suit had been brought under statute requiring that all water users be made parties.

        The word “acquired” necessarily means more than acquisition from a previous water owner whose rights had been adjudicated because the purchaser would be bound by the decree as to his predecessor in interest. Owsley Canal Co. v. Henninger, 66 Idaho 485, 162 P.2d 389 (1945).

       Legislative findings regarding accomplished transfers and the public interest.

        <li id="t42c14s42-1425ol11a">
         The legislature finds and declares that, prior to the commencement of the Snake River basin adjudication, the northern Idaho adjudications, and the Bear River basin adjudication, many persons entitled to the use of water or owning land to which water has been made appurtenant either by decree of the court or under provisions of the constitution and statutes of this state changed the place of use, point of diversion, nature or purpose of use, or period of use of their water rights without compliance with the transfer provisions of sections 42-108 and 42-222, Idaho Code.

        <li id="t42c14s42-1425ol11b">
         The legislature finds that many of these changes occurred with the knowledge of other water users and that the water has been distributed to the right as changed. The legislature further finds and declares that the continuation of the historic water use patterns resulting from these changes is in the local public interest provided no other existing water right was injured at the time of the change. Denial of a claim based solely upon a failure to comply with sections 42-108 and 42-222, Idaho Code, where no injury or enlargement exists, would cause significant undue financial impact to a claimant and the local economy. Approval of the accomplished transfer through the procedure set forth in this section avoids the harsh economic impacts that would result from a denial of the claim.

        <li id="t42c14s42-1425ol11c">
         The legislature further finds and declares that examination of these changes by the director through the procedures of section 42-222, Idaho Code, would be impractical and unduly burdensome. The more limited examination of these changes provided for in this section constitutes a reasonable procedure for an expeditious review by the director while ensuring that the changes do not injure other existing water rights or constitute an enlargement of use of the original right.

Except for the consent requirements of section 42-108, Idaho Code, all requirements of sections 42-108 and 42-222, Idaho Code, are hereby waived in accordance with the following procedures:

After a hearing, the director shall submit a supplemental report to the district court setting forth his findings and conclusions. If the claimant or any person who filed an objection to the accomplished transfer is aggrieved by the director’s determination, they may seek review before the district court. If the change is disallowed, the claimant shall be entitled to resume use of the original water right, provided such resumption of use will not cause injury or can be mitigated to prevent injury to existing water rights. The unapproved change shall not be deemed a forfeiture or abandonment of the original water right.

         The legislature further finds that it is in the public interest to waive certain statutory provisions for the appropriation of water that has been diverted and applied to beneficial use to ensure the economic and agricultural base in the state of Idaho as it existed on the date of the commencement of an adjudication and to maintain historic water use patterns existing on that date.

       The mandatory permit requirements of sections 42-201 and 42-229, Idaho Code, are waived, and a new water right may be decreed for the enlarged use of the original water right based upon the diversion and application to beneficial use, with a priority date as of the date of completion of the enlargement of use for any enlargement occurring on or before the commencement date of an adjudication; provided however, that the rate of diversion of the original water right and the separate water right for the enlarged use, combined, shall not exceed the rate of diversion authorized for the original water right; and further provided, that the enlargement in use did not injure water rights existing on the date of the enlargement of use. An enlargement may be decreed if conditions directly related to the injury can be imposed on the original water right and the new water right that mitigate any injury to a water right existing on the date of enactment of this act. If injury to a water right later in time cannot be mitigated, then the new right for the enlarged use shall be advanced to a date one (1) day later than the priority date for the junior water right injured by the enlargement. It is further provided that any such enlargement of use allowed in a general adjudication shall not constitute an abandonment or forfeiture of the original water right to the extent of current use.
    (3) The director shall publish a notice of enlargement of water right for all water rights recommended under this section. The notice shall contain a summary of the notice of claim and shall be published in the same manner as notices for applications to appropriate water in section 42-203A, Idaho Code. Any person who has filed an application for a water right prior to the enactment of this act or who has been issued a permit for a water right prior to commencement of an adjudication but who has not filed a claim in an adjudication shall have thirty (30) days from the date of last publication of the notice of enlargement of a water right under this section to file a petition with the department of water resources to assert any claimed injury from the enlargement. No appeal of the determination of the department shall be allowed. If the applicant or permittee is dissatisfied with the determination of the department on any claim of injury, the sole remedy is to intervene in the general adjudication and assert their claim of injury in an objection to the water right.

     <p>
      Persons entitled to the use of water or owning any land to which water has been made appurtenant by decree, license or constitutional appropriation have, through water conservation and other means, enlarged the use of said water without increasing the rate of diversion and without complying with the mandatory permit system adopted by the legislature. Enlargements have been done with the knowledge of other water users, and water has been distributed based upon the right as enlarged. Junior water users made appropriations based upon a water system that reflected these enlarged uses. Thus, the legislature further finds and declares that it is in the public interest to waive the mandatory permit requirements for these enlargements in use prior to the commencement of a general adjudication, as long as such enlargements in use did not increase the rate of diversion of the original water right or exceed the rate of diversion for irrigation provided in section 42-202, Idaho Code, after the enlargement of use, and the enlargement of use did not reduce the quantity of water available to other water rights existing on the date of the enlargement in use.

        Because this section provides that only those enlargements which do not increase the rate of diversion, do not injure other water rights existing on the date of enlargement, and which fully mitigate any potential injury to junior water rights existing as of the date of enactment are permitted, this section is constitutional as written; it provides that an enlargement cannot be allowed that would injure a junior appropriator.

        Irrigation district’s request for an enlargement of water rights was properly denied under this section if the water in question was characterized as drain or waste water because amnesty was not allowed for water coming from an unappropriated source. If the water was treated as groundwater, relief was still not granted because this section required subordination to those priority rights established prior to April 12, 1994.

       Legislative findings:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t42c14s42-1427ol11a">
         The legislature finds that existing water rights are not uniformly described. Many old water rights were simply defined by source, priority date and diversion rate. Over time, the legislature and courts have made this original description of a water right more specific by the addition of other elements. Because of the increasing demand for water, it is important that the elements of a water right be standardized to allow for fair and efficient administration of the limited water supply. One (1) purpose of chapter 14, title 42, Idaho Code, is to establish, through an adjudication a uniform description for surface water rights, ground water rights and water rights which include storage.
        </li>
        <li id="t42c14s42-1427ol11b">
         Because of the passage of time it is not possible to establish with any degree of certainty the undefined elements of a decreed or licensed water right as they existed on the date the right was established, because water delivery has occurred based upon the historic water use patterns and custom, and because attempts to define elements of a water right based upon unknown conditions in existence on the date of the establishment of the water right could result in significant impacts upon the claimant, the local economy and tax base, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to provide a mechanism to decree previously undefined elements of existing water rights based upon conditions existing on the date of commencement of the adjudication provided the claimant is not exceeding any previously determined and recorded element of the decreed or licensed water right.

       If a licensed or decreed water right does not describe all of the elements of a water right required in section 42-1409, Idaho Code, the director shall include in his report recommendations for those elements not defined by the prior license or decree based upon the extent of beneficial use of the water right as of the date of the commencement of an adjudication.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby declares that the public health, safety and welfare require that the streams of this state and their environments be protected against loss of water supply to preserve the minimum stream flows required for the protection of fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty, transportation and navigation values, and water quality. The preservation of the water of the streams of this state for such purposes when made pursuant to this act is necessary and desirable for all the inhabitants of this state, is in the public interest and is hereby declared to be a beneficial use of such water. The legislature further declares that minimum stream flow is a beneficial use of water of the streams of this state for the purpose of protecting such waters from interstate diversion to other states or by the federal government for use outside the boundaries of the state of Idaho. Minimum stream flows as established hereunder shall be prior in right to any claims asserted by any other state, government agency, or person for out of state diversion. It is, therefore, necessary that authority be granted to receive, consider, approve or reject applications for permits to appropriate water of the streams of this state to such beneficial uses to preserve such water from subsequent appropriation to other beneficial uses under the provisions of chapter 2, title 42, Idaho Code.

        Where the Box Canyon area was designated by the bureau of land management as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), and where the values justifying the ACEC designation included the identification of four candidate threatened and endangered aquatic species and the scenic and unique natural qualities of the area, the protection of this habitat fell within the local public interest as defined in

     <p>
      Whenever the board desires to appropriate a minimum stream flow of the unappropriated waters of any stream, it shall submit an application to the director. Such application shall be made upon forms to be furnished by the director and shall include:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">

       Such other information as shall be required by the form furnished by the director.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Upon the receipt of an application filed under the provisions of this act, the director shall forward a copy thereof to the departments of fish and game, environmental quality, parks and recreation, and any other public entity likely to have an interest or knowledge in the matter. The director shall also prepare a notice describing the proposed appropriation of minimum stream flow and cause said notice to be published once each week in two (2) consecutive weekly issues of a newspaper published within the county where the appropriation of minimum stream flow is proposed, if there is such newspaper, otherwise in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. The director may also give other notice of the proposed appropriation in such manner and to such persons or organizations as he may determine. Such notice shall specify the time and place for a public hearing to be held concerning the proposed appropriation of minimum stream flow. Such hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of section 42-1701A(1) and (2), Idaho Code. The director shall have power to administer oaths and to require the attendance of such witnesses and the production of such books, records, and papers as he may desire at the hearing and for that purpose the director may apply to the district court for a subpoena for any witnesses or a subpoena duces tecum to compel the production of any books, records, or papers which shall be served and returned in the same manner as a subpoena in a civil case. In case of any disobedience or neglect to obey a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum it shall be the duty of the district court in any county of this state in which such disobedience, neglect, or refusal occurs, or any judge thereof, on application by the director, to compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of a subpoena issued by a regularly constituted court. Upon the conclusion of the hearings and completion of any investigation conducted by the director, he shall enter his findings in writing approving the application in whole, or in part, or upon conditions or rejecting said application. Approval of any such application must be based upon a finding that such appropriation of minimum stream flow:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) will not interfere with any vested water right, permit, or water right application with priority of right date earlier than the date of receipt in the office of the director of a complete application for appropriation of minimum stream flow filed under the provisions of this act;
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) is in the public, as opposed to private, interest;
     </p>
     <p>
      (c) is necessary for the preservation of fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty, navigation, transportation, or water quality of the stream;
     </p>
     <p>
      (d) is the minimum flow or lake level and not the ideal or most desirable flow or lake level; and
     </p>
     <p>
      (e) is capable of being maintained as evidenced by records of stream flows and water levels and the existing or future establishment of necessary gauging stations and bench marks.
     </p>
     <p>
      A copy of the director’s findings shall be mailed to the board and to each person or organization who gave testimony in support of or in opposition to the proposed appropriation. The board or any person testifying at a hearing who is aggrieved by a decision of the director shall have the right to have that decision reviewed by the courts pursuant to section 42-1701A(4), Idaho Code. Approved applications shall be submitted to each legislature by the fifth legislative day of each regular session, and: (i) shall not become finally effective until affirmatively acted upon by concurrent resolution of the Idaho legislature; or (ii) except that if the legislature fails to act prior to the end of the regular session to which the application was submitted, the application shall be considered approved.

The designated reach begins at water diversion L-6 located on the Lemhi river in the southeast quarter (¼) of section twenty-four (24), township twenty-one (21) north, range twenty-two (22) east of the Boise meridian, and ends at the confluence of the Lemhi river with the Salmon river near the southwest corner of section thirty-two (32), township twenty-two (22) north, range twenty-two (22) east of the Boise meridian, Lemhi county.

       Notice. When the director commences an administrative enforcement action the notice of violation shall be served upon the alleged violator in person or by certified mail. The notice of violation shall identify the alleged violation and shall specify each provision of the designated chapter, rule, permit, condition of approval or order which has been violated. The notice of violation shall state the remedy, including any demand to cease and desist, restoration and mitigation measures, and the amount of any civil penalty the director seeks for redress of the violation. Factors the director may consider in seeking the appropriate remedy include the impact of the violation and whether the violation was willful, a repeat violation for which the violator had been given a prior written warning, or the violator has otherwise refused to comply with the department’s lawful directives. The notice of violation shall inform the person to whom it is directed of an opportunity to confer with the director or the director’s designee in a compliance conference concerning the alleged violation.
      </li>

The conference shall be held within twenty-one (21) days of the receipt of the notice unless a later date is agreed upon between the parties. If a compliance conference is not requested, the director may proceed with a civil enforcement action as provided in this section.

       Compliance conference and consent order. The compliance conference shall provide an opportunity for the recipient of a notice of violation to explain the circumstance of the alleged violation and, where appropriate, to present a proposal for remedying the damage caused by the violation and assuring future compliance. If the recipient and the director agree on a plan to remedy damage caused by the alleged violation and to assure future compliance, they may enter into a consent order formalizing their agreement. The consent order may include a provision providing for payment of any agreed civil penalty. The consent order shall be effective immediately upon signing by both parties and shall preclude a civil enforcement action for the same alleged violation. If a party does not comply with the terms of the consent order, the director may seek and obtain in any appropriate district court, specific performance of the consent order and other relief as authorized by law. If the parties cannot agree to a consent order within fifty-six (56) days after the receipt of the notice of violation, or if the recipient does not request a compliance conference, the director may commence and prosecute a civil enforcement action in the district court in accordance with this section.

The director shall collect facts and make surveys to ascertain suitable locations for reservoirs upon streams where such reservoirs may be possible and beneficial, and shall, as far as possible, determine the cost of constructing such reservoirs, and all other facts possible in regard to quantity of water possible to be stored, the character and extent of land that may be reclaimed by the water from such reservoirs, together with all other information possible that may bear upon the subject. The director shall become familiar with the waterways and irrigable land in the state and the needs of the state as to irrigation matters, and all records of any such information shall be the property of the state and open to public inspection. The director shall keep full and complete records of all measurements of streams, surveys, examinations or other valuable information that may come into his possession concerning any of the duties of the department, and shall furnish reasonable information in regard to such measurements or surveys to the newspapers of the state upon proper request.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislature by this act to provide for the regulation of construction, maintenance and operation of all dams, reservoirs and mine tailings impoundment structures exclusively by the state to the extent required for the protection of public safety. All dams, reservoirs and mine tailings impoundment structures in the state are under jurisdiction of the department of water resources. The department of water resources, under the police power of the state, shall supervise the construction, enlargement, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation and removal of dams, reservoirs and mine tailings impoundment structures for the protection of life and property. The department of water resources may enter into agreements with other state agencies having jurisdiction over water storage structures to limit duplication of inspection, review and regulation of such structures.

     <p>
      Owners who shall desire to construct, or enlarge, or alter or repair, meaning only such alterations or repairs as may affect the safety of the dam or reservoir, any dam, for the purpose of storing or appropriating or diverting any of the waters of this state, when the same is to be ten (10) feet or more in height and having a storage capacity of fifty (50) acre-feet or more, except as otherwise in this chapter provided, shall submit duplicate plans, drawings and specifications of the proposed work to the director, and construction of a new dam or enlargement, or alteration or repairs shall not be commenced until the owner has applied for and obtained written approval of the plans, drawings and specifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Owners of dams under construction on the effective date of this legislation and for which plans, drawings and specifications are required but have not been approved on or before the effective date of this legislation shall submit such plans, drawings and specifications for approval, with the fee established hereinafter. The director shall give notice to owners to submit plans, drawings and specifications, and failure to submit plans, drawings and specifications for approval within thirty (30) days of the date of mailing the notice shall be punishable as provided in this act, and construction shall be stopped upon issuance of an order by the director unless for good cause shown as determined by the director further time is allowed. The notice and/or order provided for in this paragraph may be given by certified mail and a return receipt signed by the owner or responsible company shall constitute prima facie evidence of service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of the plans, drawings and specifications, the director shall give consideration thereto and shall approve or disapprove the same within the time provided in this section, and if he approves them, the director shall affix his approval thereto and return one (1) copy of each such plans, drawings and specifications, with his approval, to the party or parties proposing to construct the works.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plans, drawings and specifications submitted to the director complete with fees shall be approved or disapproved in no more than sixty (60) days and in no less than fourteen (14) days after receipt. Defective plans, drawings and specifications made in a bona fide attempt to conform to the law and rules of the water resource board shall not be rejected but notice of defect shall be sent to the owner by certified mail. If within thirty (30) days of the date of mailing the notice the owner does not file amended and perfected plans, drawings and specifications, the plans, drawings and specifications shall be rejected and canceled unless for good cause shown the director allows the owner further time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The construction of all dams under plans, drawings and specifications approved by the director shall be pursued with reasonable diligence to completion. In the event that an owner fails to commence actual construction and maintain reasonable construction progress of the dam under the plans, drawings and specifications approved by the director prior to or after the effective date of this act, such approval may be voided by the director one (1) year after such approval. Notice of the intent to void any such approval shall be sent by the director to the owner by certified mail and said owner shall be allowed thirty (30) days within which to show cause why such approval should not be voided. The director may grant additional time within which to commence the construction under plans, drawings and specifications approved by the director upon a showing of reasonable cause. Plans, drawings and specifications for which approval has become void must be resubmitted for approval, with the fee therefor as hereafter provided, prior to commencing construction of any such dam.

     <p>
      During the construction, enlargement, repair, alteration, or removal of any dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure, the director shall make or cause to have made continuous or periodical inspections at state expense for the purpose of securing conformity with the approved plans and specifications, but shall require the owner to perform at his expense such work or tests as necessary to disclose information sufficient to enable him to determine that conformity with the approved plans and specifications is being secured, which shall include adequate inspection, at owner’s expense to verify compliance with approved plans, drawings and specifications.

     <p>
      The work of construction, enlargement, repair, alteration or removal of a dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure, for which approved plans, drawings and specifications are required, shall be under the responsible charge of a professional engineer who shall certify that such construction, enlargement, repair, alteration or removal was done in accordance with approved plans, drawings and specifications. If, after any inspections, investigations or examinations, or at any time as the work progresses, or at any time prior to issuance of a certificate of approval, it is found by the director that amendments, modifications or changes are necessary to insure safety, the director may order the owner to revise the plans and specifications. If conditions are revealed which will not permit the construction of a safe dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure, the approval may be revoked. In the event that conditions imposed may be waived or made less burdensome without sacrificing a proper margin of safety, the director may authorize an owner to revise the plans and specifications accordingly. If at any time during construction, enlargement, repair or alterations [alteration] of any dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure the director finds that the work is not being done in accordance with the provision of the approval and the approved plans and specifications, he shall give a written notice and order by certified mail or by personal service to the owner. The notice and order shall state the particulars in which the approval and approved plans and specifications or the approval and approved plans and specifications as revised are not being or have not been complied with and shall order the immediate compliance with the approval and approved revised plans and specifications as the case may be. The director may order that no further work be done until such compliance has been effected and approved by him. A failure to comply with the approval and approved plans and specifications as originally approved or as revised shall render the approval subject to revocation by the director, if compliance is not made in accordance therewith after notice and order from him as provided in this chapter.

      Supervision over the maintenance and operation of dams, reservoirs and mine tailings impoundment structures insofar as necessary to safeguard life and property from injury by reason of the failure thereof is vested in the director of the department of water resources. The director shall at state expense inspect or cause to be inspected, as often as he thinks advisable, every dam used for holding water and mine tailings impoundment structure used for holding tailings slurry in this state; however, all dams or mine tailings impoundment structures regulated by the department shall be inspected at least once every five (5) years, and if after any such inspection such dam or mine tailings impoundment structure, in the opinion of the director, is unsafe, and life or property liable to be endangered by reason thereof, the director shall give written notice and order by certified mail or by personal service upon the owner or owners to remove or repair the same so as to make it safe. If such owner or owners shall neglect or refuse to remove or repair the same after notice to that effect has been given in writing by the director, the director may draw off all or part of such water from behind such dam, embankment or mine tailings slurry from behind mine tailings impoundment structure and keep said water or mine tailings slurry drawn off until such time as the orders shall be complied with. In determining whether or not a dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure or proposed dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure constitutes or would constitute a danger to life or property, the director shall take into consideration the possibility that the dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure might be endangered by overtopping, seepage, settlement, erosion, cracking, earth movement or other conditions which exist or might occur in any area in the vicinity of the dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      No action shall be brought against the state, the water resource board, the director, or the department of water resources or their respective agents or employees for the recovery of damages caused by the partial or total failure of any dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure or through the operation of any dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure upon the ground that such defendant is liable by virtue of any of the following:

     </p>
     <p>
      The director may require owners to keep records of, and to report on, maintenance, operation, staffing and engineering and geologic investigations, and the water resource board shall issue such rules as necessary to secure maintenance and operation and to require staffing and engineering and geologic investigations which will safeguard life and property. In addition, the owner of a dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure or his agent shall fully and promptly advise the department of any sudden or unprecedented flood or unusual or alarming circumstance or occurrence affecting the safety of the dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure. The director, from time to time, shall make inspections of dams, reservoirs and mine tailings impoundment structures at state expense for the purpose of determining their safety, but shall require owners to perform at their expense such work as necessary to disclose information sufficient to enable the director to determine conditions of dams, reservoirs, and mine tailings impoundment structures in regard to their safety and to perform at their expense other work necessary to secure maintenance and operation which will safeguard life and property.

        This section appears to grant absolute immunity to the state, the director of the department, and the department itself for any claim for damages arising out of the supervision, maintenance, operation and inspection of dams and reservoirs. Union Pac. R.R. v. Idaho, 654 F. Supp. 1236 (D. Idaho 1987), amended, 663 F. Supp. 75 (D. Idaho 1987).

       <p>
        In a suit brought by owners of flooded farmland, the state was immune from liability for any decision of the director of the department of water resources in taking measures to protect against failure of a dike; this immunity extended to the flood control district and the chairman, and also to the water district and its watermaster and chairman since there was no evidence they owned, controlled, operated or maintained or managed the dike. Marty v. State, 117 Idaho 133, 786 P.2d 524 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        By the terms of this section the state and the Idaho department of water resources and their agents or employees are given immunity from damages caused through measures taken to control and regulate a dam or to protect against failure of any dam during an emergency.

      § 42-1718. Remedial means for protection of life and property.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The director shall immediately employ any remedial means necessary to protect life and property if either:
     </p>
     <ol Class="alpha">
      <li id="t42c17s42-1718ol1a">
       The condition of any dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure is so dangerous to the safety of life or property as not to permit time for the issuance and enforcement of an order relative to maintenance or operation.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c17s42-1718ol1b">
       Passing or imminent floods threaten the safety of any dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c17s42-1718ol1c">
       Take such other steps as may be essential to safeguard life and property.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In applying the remedial means provided for in this act, the department may in emergency do any of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Lower the water level by releasing water from the reservoir or lower mine tailings slurry level by releasing slurry from the mine tailings impoundment structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) Completely empty the reservoir.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director shall continue in full charge and control of such dam or reservoir, or both, or mine tailings impoundment structure, or all, and its appurtenances, until they are rendered safe or the emergency occasioning the action has ceased.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the cost of the emergency remedial action by the director for the protection of life and property exceeds the amount of money appropriated from the general fund specifically for that purpose, the additional costs may be defrayed by the issuance of deficiency warrants as may be authorized by the board of examiners. When so authorized, the state controller shall draw deficiency warrants against the general fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cost and expenses of the remedial means provided in this act, including cost of any work done to render a dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure or its appurtenances safe, shall be recoverable by the state from the owner. If not paid within sixty (60) days of invoice, action may be brought by the director in the district court of the district wherein the dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure or any part thereof is situated. The funds recovered shall be returned to the general fund to offset the amount of the deficiency warrant.
     </p>
     <p>
      No action shall be brought by the state against the owner for pollution which may occur in the event that the director orders emergency dumping or bypassing.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A certificate of approval shall be issued for all dams and mine tailings impoundment structures, new or existing, upon a finding that the dam or reservoir is safe to impound water or the mine tailings impoundment structure is safe to impound mine tailings slurry within the limitations prescribed in the certificate. Upon written request by an owner for a certificate of approval, the director shall within fourteen (14) days inspect or cause to be inspected and issue a certificate if he finds that the dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure is safe to impound water or tailings slurry within the limitations prescribed in the certificate. Pending the issuance of a certificate of approval, the owner of a new dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure shall not, through action or inaction, cause the dam or reservoir to impound water or mine tailings impoundment structure to impound mine tailings slurry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each certificate of approval issued may contain such terms and conditions as the director may prescribe. The director may revoke any certificate of approval whenever he determines that the dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure constitutes a danger to life and property. Whenever he deems such action necessary to safeguard life and property, the director may also amend the terms and conditions of any such certificate by issuing a new certificate containing the revised terms and conditions. The owner of a dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure for which a certificate of approval has been issued shall not, through action or inaction, cause the dam or reservoir to impound water or mine tailings impoundment structure to impound mine tailings slurry after the certificate terminates unless a new certificate is issued for the dam, reservoir or mine tailings impoundment structure. Those inflows that cannot be diverted may still be allowed to enter the structure, but the lowest possible level must be maintained until safety of the structure is assured. A new certificate shall be issued upon a finding by the director that the dam or reservoir is safe to impound water or mine tailings impoundment structure is safe to impound tailings slurry within the limits prescribed in the certificate.
     </p>
     <p>
      No action shall be brought by the state against the owner for pollution which may occur in the event that the director orders emergency dumping or bypassing.

        “1. Pursuant to 2006 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 136 and Section 42-1734A, Idaho Code, the Idaho Water Resource Board has prepared and adopted the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer as a component of the Comprehensive State Water Plan. Pursuant to Section 42-1734B(6), Idaho Code, the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (‘ESPA CAMP’) is approved as a component of the Comprehensive State Water Plan. Pursuant to Section 42-1734B(4), Idaho Code, all state agencies shall exercise their duties in a manner consistent with the ESPA CAMP.
    “2. The Idaho Water Resource Board shall prepare and submit to the Legislature for approval, a funding mechanism for implementation of Phase I of the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. The funding mechanism shall be consistent with the funding participation targets set forth in the ESPA CAMP and shall be developed with the assistance of the ESPA CAMP Implementation Committee. The Idaho Water Resource Board shall, with the assistance of the Implementation Committee, prepare and submit to the Legislature for approval any subsequent proposed changes to the ESPA CAMP. Implementation plans should seek to optimize outcomes for fish and wildlife, recreation, hydropower, municipalities, irrigation, aquaculture and other uses.

        “3. Implementation of Phase I of the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer is subject to legislative approval of a funding mechanism, which shall be consistent with the funding participation targets set forth in the ESPA CAMP. The act does not constitute an obligation of state funds and any state funding shall be subject to the availability of funds. State agencies may use previously appropriated funds to begin implementation of Phase I.

        “4. The CAMP recognizes that incidental ground water recharge that occurs as a result of the exercise of surface and flood irrigation water rights is an important component of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer water supply. The CAMP implementation plan shall include measures that recognize the benefits of incidental recharge, and that will encourage water users and canal managers to continue their historic surface water diversion practices.

Construction of private river access facilities (i.e., boat docks) may be allowed with Idaho Water Resource Board and other regulatory agencies’ approval. New diversion works are limited to pump installations that do not create an obstruction in the river; are to supply water for domestic, commercial, or municipal uses; are visually blended with the surroundings so as to be less noticeable from the river; and are constructed to minimize harm to fish and wildlife.”

        “1. Pursuant to 2006 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 136 and Section 42-1734A, Idaho Code, the Idaho Water Resource Board has prepared and adopted the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer as a component of the Comprehensive State Water Plan. Pursuant to Section 42-1734B(6), Idaho Code, the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (‘ESPA CAMP’) is approved as a component of the Comprehensive State Water Plan. Pursuant to Section 42-1734B(4), Idaho Code, all state agencies shall exercise their duties in a manner consistent with the ESPA CAMP.

The Idaho Water Resource Board shall prepare and submit to the Legislature for approval, a funding mechanism for implementation of Phase I of the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. The funding mechanism shall be consistent with the funding participation targets set forth in the ESPA CAMP and shall be developed with the assistance of the ESPA CAMP Implementation Committee. The Idaho Water Resource Board shall, with the assistance of the Implementation Committee, prepare and submit to the Legislature for approval any subsequent proposed changes to the ESPA CAMP. Implementation plans should seek to optimize outcomes for fish and wildlife, recreation, hydropower, municipalities, irrigation, aquaculture and other uses.
    “3. Implementation of Phase I of the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer is subject to legislative approval of a funding mechanism, which shall be consistent with the funding participation targets set forth in the ESPA CAMP. The act does not constitute an obligation of state funds and any state funding shall be subject to the availability of funds. State agencies may use previously appropriated funds to begin implementation of Phase I.

        This section requiring legislative approval of the state water plan is unconstitutional since it purports to authorize the legislature to perform functions constitutionally assigned to the water resources board, but even if this section had authorized legislative action which was not in conflict with Idaho Const., Art. XV, § 7, it could still have no legal effect because it provides for legislative action on the state water plan by means of a concurrent resolution. To the extent that Idaho Const., Art. XV, § 7 authorizes the legislature to influence the operation of the water resources board, it does so only as to “such laws as may be prescribed by the legislature”; legislative action by resolution is not a “law” in that context.

       <p>
        “Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
       </p>
       <p>
        “WHEREAS, Section 7 of Article XV, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho empowers the Idaho Water Resource Board to formulate and implement a State Water Plan for optimum development of water resources in the public interest; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “WHEREAS, Section 42-1731 [42-1730], Idaho Code, provides that the optimum use of the water resources of Idaho, requires the formulation of a coordinated, integrated, multiple use water resource policy and the development of a plan to activate this policy as rapidly as possible; and
    “WHEREAS, the Idaho Water Resource Board, by the authority of Section 42-1734, Idaho Code, shall formulate a program for use of all unappropriated water resources of this State, based upon studies and after public hearings, in affected areas at which all interested parties shall be given the opportunity to appear; and

       </p>
       <p>
        “WHEREAS, Section 42-1736, Idaho Code, provides that the State Water Plan shall not become effective until approved by the Legislature; and

       <p>
        “WHEREAS, it is the finding of the Legislature that the State Water Plan as amended by this resolution complies with the intent of the Legislature.
       </p>
       <p>
        “NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the Second Regular Session of the Forty-fourth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that the State Water Plan as adopted by the Idaho Water Resource Board and submitted to the Legislature is hereby approved by the Legislature pursuant to Section 42-1736, Idaho Code, with the following changes:
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 1: PROTECTION OF EXISTING WATER RIGHTS
       </p>
       <p>
        The State Water Plan shall be a guide concerning the uses of water within the State of Idaho. Water rights and the administration of water rights shall be governed by statute. Section 42-203, Idaho Code, should be amended to provide the following: (1) protection for all existing water. Nothing in this plan shall adversely affect water rights established and vested under the Constitution and laws of Idaho; (2) all new water uses, both consumptive and non-consumptive such as irrigation, municipal, industrial, power, mining, fish and wildlife, recreation, aquatic life, and water quality will be judged beneficial uses subject to Article XV, Section 3, of the state Constitution; (3) if conflicts occur between meeting new water uses, the approval or denial of the application shall consider the local public interest as defined by statute.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 2: NATURE OF USE OF WATER RIGHTS
       </p>
       <p>
        Water users should be allowed to change the nature of use of their own water rights for use within the State of Idaho provided other water rights are not injured thereby. Section 42-222 should be amended to allow existing water right holders to make such changes provided the change is not in conflict with the state water plan adopted by the Idaho Water Resource Board as approved by the legislature.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 3: CONSOLIDATE STATE WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION
       </p>
       <p>
        The state programs of water quantity and water quality planning and administration should be consolidated in the Department of Water Resources. The Idaho Code should be amended to implement this policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 4: UNRECORDED WATER RIGHTS
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims except for domestic uses should be submitted on all existing unrecorded water rights within the State of Idaho by June 20, 1983. Legislation implementing this policy should provide that failure to file such a claim by the prescribed filing date shall be grounds for instituting an action for forfeiture of the claimed right.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 5: FLOOD PRONE AREA IDENTIFICATION
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Water Resources should identify flood prone areas throughout the state. The department shall utilize all previous and current flood prone area studies and shall make the information available for public use. The flood prone area identified shall be based on flooding from the 100 year flood history.
    POLICY NO. 6: INSTREAM FLOWS
       </p>
       <p>
        Water rights should be granted for instream flow purposes. The legislation authorizing this policy should recognize and protect existing water rights and priorities of all established rights and delegate responsibilities for determining flows and administrative authority to the Department of Water Resources. The legislation should also direct that the Idaho Water Resource Board shall be the only applicant for instream flow. All applications by the Water Resource Board shall be subject to the approval of the legislature.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 7: STATE NATURAL AND RECREATIONAL SYSTEM
       </p>
       <p>
        A State Natural and Recreational River System should be established and designed to fit the desires of the citizens of Idaho. Legislation implementing this policy should permit the protection of the unique features that exist on each of the various rivers bordered by public lands within the state and should provide the necessary authorization and adequate funding to state and local government to protect such rivers and related lands for recreational, scenic and natural values while still allowing the widest possible opportunity for use by private interests. Funds would be provided from the Water Management Fund created under Policy 31 for this purpose.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 10: PROTECTION OF LAKE AND RESERVOIR SHORELANDS
       </p>
       <p>
        Local units of government should prepare comprehensive plans and adopt zoning standards for the management of lake and reservoir shorelands to protect the water resources and its uses. Funds would be provided from the Water Management Fund created under Policy 31 for this purpose.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 11: WATER SUPPLY BANK
       </p>
       <p>
        A water supply bank should be established for the purpose of acquiring water rights or water entitlements, provided other water rights are not injured, from willing sellers for reallocation by sale or lease to other new or existing uses within the State of Idaho. Legislation authorizing the water supply bank should also provide for the bank to be self-financing in the long run with initial funding to be provided by creation of a Water Management Fund as provided for in Policy 31.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 12: CONSERVANCY DISTRICTS
       </p>
       <p>
        Water Conservancy Districts should be established where needed. Legislation implementing this policy should provide for an equitable funding procedure to spread costs among all beneficiaries.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 13: ENERGY PLAN
       </p>
       <p>
        A State energy plan should be prepared. The Department of Water Resources should contribute the water related components to such a plan. Legislation authorizing this policy should also provide funding through the Energy Development and Study Fund for this purpose as provided in Policy 31.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 14: WATER CLAIMS BY INDIAN TRIBES
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims to water by Idaho Indian tribes should be identified by June 30, 1983.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 15: FEDERAL WATER CLAIMS
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims to water by the federal government should be identified by June 30, 1983.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 16: FEDERAL RESERVOIRS WATER ALLOCATION
       </p>
       <p>
        An agreement should be established with federal agencies to allow review by the Idaho Water Resource Board of any proposed allocation of water in excess of 500 acre-feet annually from federal reservoirs.
    POLICY NO. 17: STATE ADMINISTRATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal programs dealing with water should be administered by the State when in the state’s interest to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 18: COMBINE APPLICATIONS FOR WATER RESOURCES
       </p>
       <p>
        Existing state statutes should be reviewed and amended so that applicants may complete a single application form to request approval from necessary state authorities to develop or utilize the state’s water and related land resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 19: LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE
       </p>
       <p>
        A Legislative Committee on Water Resources should continue to work with the Idaho Water Resource Board in implementing the State Water Plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 20: LAND DEVELOPMENT POLICY
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the supply of water from a particular water source is limited, it is preferable to develop new lands in Idaho of higher agricultural productivity over those of a lower productivity providing existing rights are protected and water is not transferred between water basins within the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        POLICY NO. 21: PROTECTION OF POTENTIAL RESERVOIR SITES
       </p>
       <p>
        Potential reservoir sites should be protected against significant land use change. The legislation implementing this policy should recognize rights of existing land owners and should direct the state to acquire lands for reservoir sites as they become available for sale. Reservoir sites given this protection should be re-evaluated on ten-year intervals. Funds would be provided from the Water Management Fund created under Policy 31 for this purpose.

        POLICY NO. 32: SNAKE RIVER BASIN
       </p>
       <p>
        The available and unappropriated waters of the Snake River Basin are allocated to satisfy existing uses, meet needs for future growth and development, and protect the environment. The allocations recognize and protect existing water uses and rights. The water allocations are made by large regions to allow the widest possible discretion in application and it is the policy of the State of Idaho to augment, maintain, enhance and increase available, usable water by additional upstream, off stream and aquifer storage.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is legislative intent that main stem Snake River flows will be protected against further depletions and preserved to provide the following average daily flows at the following U.S. Geological Survey stream gaging stations.

        Studies indicate that sufficient water exists in excess of those flows to provide for additional uses if water conserving and storage facilities are constructed.
    Water is allocated for electric energy. Additional hydro-electric power sites remain on streams within the Snake River Basin. Wherever feasible these should be developed as part of multi-purpose projects. Future electric energy requirements will be largely supplied from thermal plants. The plan provides for 170,000 acre-feet beyond August 1975 levels for consumptive use in cooling thermal power plants. The depletion is distributed as follows: Upper Snake — 75,000 acre-feet; Southwest Idaho — 30,000 acre-feet. In addition, flows in the Snake River will be stabilized for the hydro-power generating capability of the river.

       <p>
        The available and unappropriated waters of the Spokane, Pend Oreille-Clark Fork and Kootenai river basins are allocated to satisfy existing and potential needs for economic development and environmental quality. This allocation recognizes and protects all existing and potential water uses and private and public rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Water is allocated for electric energy. Additional hydro-electric power sites remain on streams within the Panhandle River Basins. Wherever feasible these should be developed as part of multi-purpose projects. Future electrical energy requirements will be largely supplied from thermal plants. The plan provides for 18,000 acre-feet of depletion from the Pend Oreille-Clark Fork River system in the Panhandle Basins for evaporative cooling of thermal power plants.

        Sections 1 and 2 of S.L. 2005, ch. 362 provided “Section 1. Legislative Findings. (1) Water users relying upon surface water and ground water supplies in many parts of Idaho, including the Snake River Basin, which encompasses a large portion of the state, are presently experiencing or may experience water shortages due to a combination of factors, including reduced aquifer recharge due to changes in surface water irrigation practices, increased ground water withdrawals, and prolonged drought conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) It is essential that the state provide a reasonable degree of certainty and assistance in water resource management, water project funding, and water rights administration for the benefit and safeguarding of its citizens and for the benefit and safeguarding of the state and local economies that rely upon the diversion and use of water for their viability.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The legislature is determined to assist in achieving long-term stability in water supplies for the well-being of our citizens by encouraging the Water Resource Board to utilize its constitutional and statutory authorities to finance water projects designed both to enhance available water supplies and reduce demands upon our water resources in a manner that is protective of individual rights and promotes the best interests of our citizens.

      When a project has been selected by the board to be constructed by the board with money made available from the revolving fund, the board shall cause plans and cost estimates of such project to be prepared and the board is authorized to enter into a contract or contracts for construction of such project after legislative approval. The board shall insure that water developed or conserved by any such project shall be utilized or benefits accrue within this state, and it shall enter into appropriate repayment contracts with the project water users. The board shall assess against any project water user such charge as, in the opinion of the board, is necessary and reasonable for the maintenance and operation of the project during the repayment period and for repayment to the revolving fund of the amount allocated therefrom for making the feasibility study and for construction of the project, including costs for engineering services, design, specifications, and other preparatory expenses. All money allocated to the project from the revolving fund shall be repaid as determined by the board, provided that the repayment period shall not exceed 60 years.

Its action shall be based upon such determination, and the board is specifically authorized to convey title to the project to those who use the water from such project if it finds this to be in the public interest.

      <li id="t42c17s42-1763Bol11">
       Legislative findings and intent regarding rental of water by the U.S. bureau of reclamation in the Snake River basin within Idaho to augment lower Snake River flows for anadromous fish listed under the endangered species act. The legislature finds that the U.S. bureau of reclamation proposes to release up to four hundred twenty-seven thousand (427,000) acre feet of leased or uncontracted water diverted from the Snake River basin to reservoir storage above Lewiston, and to lease or acquire up to sixty thousand (60,000) acre feet of consumptive natural flow water rights diverted and consumed below Milner dam and above Swan Falls dam from the mainstem [main stem] of the Snake River to augment flows downstream of Hells Canyon dam during 2005 and through December 31, 2034. The state of Idaho is experiencing serious drought conditions and it is therefore uncertain whether this water will be available for rental for flow augmentation purposes in all years. The legislature further finds that authorization of this legislation is necessary for approval and implementation of the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004 (Mediator’s Term Sheet dated April 20, 2004, and submitted on that date to the SRBA Court in SRBA Consolidated Subcase 03-10022 and SRBA Consolidated Subcase 67-13701, with all appendices to the document), as approved, ratified, and confirmed by the 108th Congress of the United States in the “Snake River Water Rights Act of 2004,” Pub. L. No. 108-447 (H.R. 4818), 118 Stat. 3431 to 3441 (December 8, 2004). Therefore, the legislature authorizes the U.S. bureau of reclamation to lease storage and natural flow water rights through the state water supply bank and local rental pools under the limited conditions of this section. Any rentals of water for flow augmentation under any other provision of law, including section 42-108A, Idaho Code, shall be subject to the limitations and conditions of this section and the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004.

        To the extent that the district court engaged in an “as applied” analysis of the rules for conjunctive management of surface and ground water resources (CM Rules), it was in error, as administrative remedies had not been exhausted.

       <p>
        As the rules for conjunctive management of surface and ground water resources (CM Rules) specifically incorporated Idaho law, the failure to recite certain burdens and evidentiary standards, set specific timelines and set objective standards did not make them facially unconstitutional. The CM Rules also survive a facial challenge in the recognition given to partial decrees and in the treatment of carryover water. Am. Falls Reservoir Dist. No. 2 v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Res., 143 Idaho 862, 154 P.3d 433 (2007). Decrees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nowhere in this title is the director obligated to accept a prior decree issued in a private adjudication as being conclusive proof of the nature of a water right. Although a decree evidences a legal right to the use of water, it does not obligate the director to make a recommendation contrary to his findings. State v. Hagerman Water Right Owners, Inc., 130 Idaho 736, 947 P.2d 409 (1997).

       <p>
        The fact that the department went out, after the conference on the company’s application for a water permit, and examined the premises to be irrigated did not constitute legal error, where the agreement that the director could decide the case based in part “upon the records of the department” contained no limitation on the director’s statutory authority to examine the premises.

        Although the board (department of water resources) was vested with very wide discretionary powers in the exercise of the duties imposed upon it with regard to Carey Act lands, when it had thrown open to entry land of Carey Act segregation, or portion thereof, and published its notice to that effect in compliance with the statute, it was not vested with discretionary power to refuse to allow entry on said land by person possessing the statutory qualification and who had complied with the statutory conditions precedent to a right to make an entry, and in case of such refusal, mandamus will lie to compel board to allow entry.

      § 42-2039. Restoration of lands authorized.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature hereby recognizes and acknowledges the need to assure replacement of the grazing and wildlife land uses displaced by Carey Act developments. In order to facilitate such replacements, any settlers having contracts with the state for reclamation of lands segregated under the Carey Act shall include grazing and wildlife restoration work in total or in part to the maximum expenditure of five dollars ($5.00) per acre for grazing restoration and one dollar ($1.00) per acre for wildlife restoration as a legitimate and necessary cost of the reclamation effort. The settlers are hereby authorized to subcontract with the bureau of land management, or any party designated by the bureau, for the purpose of accomplishing this restoration work. Payment by the Carey Act settlers for the restoration work shall be at the time the settler is granted patent to the lands developed. The director of the department of water resources is hereby authorized and directed to accept restoration expenditures as bona fide land development costs of the company up to an amount not to exceed five dollars ($5.00) per acre for grazing restoration and one dollar ($1.00) per acre for wildlife restoration.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that no suitable lands are available for restoration as grazing lands as provided herein, the director is authorized to so certify, and the payment in lieu of restoration shall be made directly to the person with previous grazing rights to the land under Carey Act development.
     </p>
     <p>
      In those instances where a Carey Act project application is filed for land on which any livestock watering improvements, established trail rights, or recent successful reseedings of less than five (5) years usage are in place and functional at the time of the filing, then these watering improvements, trail rights or reseedings shall be replaced in kind notwithstanding costs in excess of the limitation of five dollars ($5.00) imposed herein. The director of the department of water resources shall be responsible for the negotiation and determination of the values in excess of five dollars ($5.00) per acre which are involved in qualifying water improvements, trail rights or recent reseedings and to whom the payments for excess values shall be made.

Said project is known as the Indian Hills project, which is located in Owyhee county approximately two (2) miles southwest of Hammett, Idaho. The Idaho water resource board is authorized by this act to proceed with the project on the basis identified and approved by the Idaho water resource board in the proposal submitted, pursuant to section 42-1734(11), Idaho Code, to the governor of Idaho on November 25, 1974; and the Idaho water resource board is further authorized to proceed in accordance with and exercise the authority for issuance of revenue bonds as provided in section 42-1734(17), Idaho Code. The Idaho water resource board is further authorized to own, sell, convey, mortgage, pledge or incumber the lands for said project and do all things necessary for the construction and completion of said project including the acquisition of all necessary real and personal property in connection therewith, together with all necessary pumping and water distribution works and facilities at the site of such water project and all other necessary and related structures and equipment, and, in addition to the powers conferred elsewhere on the Idaho water resource board, to issue and sell revenue bonds under the provisions of sections 42-1739 through 42-1749, Idaho Code, pledging thereto the revenues which the board shall derive from such water project, and such other revenues as may come into the water resource board revolving development fund from any source whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any tax funds pledged or dedicated to the water resource board revolving development fund, in order to pay the costs of planning, financing, acquiring, construction, operation and maintenance of such water project. The water resource board is further authorized to charge and collect such fees and assessments necessary for payment and reimbursement for all the costs of said project and the water resource board shall have a first and prior lien upon all lands of the project and water rights now appurtenant or to become appurtenant to said lands and water distribution facilities; said lien shall be in all respects prior to any and all other liens no matter how created or attempted to be created by the owner or possessor of the project lands or by law, and shall remain in full force and effect until the last deferred payment for water rights and project facilities is fully paid and satisfied according to the terms of the contract under which water is acquired for said project by persons making entry upon said lands.

        Water right could not be severed from land to which it was appurtenant merely to allow owner to avoid his share of maintaining and operating irrigation works, where such water right was not capable of being transferred to and applied to other lands, and water not otherwise available was still used on the land.

        Where stockholders wished to use forfeiture only to avoid paying maintenance assessments, the adjudication court’s determination that no water rights were forfeited was affirmed; a finding of forfeiture by an appropriator who did nothing to cause the nonuse of the water would have done nothing to advance the policy behind the statute to secure the maximum use and benefit of the state’s water resources.

        Utility was not barred from attempting to collect 1992 assessments as the 1992 assessments were not ripe for adjudication at the time of an earlier trial involving the parties when the trial court had ruled that assessments for prior years were illegal and uncollectible, and therefore claim preclusion did not bar the present claim, and as the trial court had not been presented with the issues of the legality of the assessment under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.30.html#t30c30s30-308A" target="_blank">§ 30-308A</a></cite> (repealed), but had been reviewing whether the assessments violated this section in the earlier trial, issue of preclusion did not bar the present claim.

     <p>
      Any corporation of the character described in this chapter, in order to secure additional water for the irrigation of the lands of its stockholders to supplement their natural flow rights, by the construction of dams or other works and the storing or impounding of winter flow, or flood, or other waters, may contract with the United States bureau of reclamation, public works administration, reconstruction finance corporation, resettlement administration or any other federal agency or instrumentality, or with any person, agency or corporation, for the construction of necessary works, or the loan of moneys for such construction, and may provide in such contract that said corporation will annually levy an assessment against its stockholders sufficient in amount to pay all obligations created by such contract, as the same mature, and will collect the same as tolls, and may provide that no part of such supplementary water shall be delivered to any stockholder until his annual toll and assessment levied with respect to such supplemental water has been paid. Any corporation so contracting shall not deliver such supplemental water to any stockholder or user except upon payment in full of such annual toll and assessment; provided, however, that no such contract may be entered into by any corporation unless and until its board of directors shall have been authorized so to do by resolution of its stockholders adopted at a regular or special meeting thereof. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to in any way affect or impair any rights such corporation now has under the law to levy and collect assessments for corporate purposes.

      Upon the filing of the petition, and the making of the cash deposit, as herein provided, the board of county commissioners shall within thirty (30) days thereafter file a copy of said petition with the director of the department of water resources of the state of Idaho, and request him to examine into and report to said board, all matters necessary and essential to disclose the practicability, necessity or advisability of the construction of the proposed works or improvement, or the proposed contract for the use or benefit of the works constructed, and thereupon said director of the department of water resources shall, without delay, proceed and examine all matters named and referred to in said petition and make such survey of the territory likely to be affected by the proposed improvement as will enable him to fully determine whether the same is necessary or practicable, and report accordingly, and if some other or different plan than that described in the petition is found practicable, said director of the department of water resources shall so report giving such details and information as will be necessary to fully inform the board of county commissioners on all matters pertaining to the practicability or feasibility of the proposed plan, either as outlined in said petition, or according to some other or different plan that may be designated and recommended by said director of the department of water resources, but it shall be his duty to outline and designate all changes, whether by extension, enlargement, additions, or otherwise, that may be necessary to make the plan of the proposed improvement practicable and feasible, showing the probable size, character and cost of such proposed work, and if he finds the improvement petitioned for is feasible, he shall include in his report a map of the proposed improvement and also give the description of the tracts of land which he deems would be benefited thereby, and the probable area that is likely to be irrigated or drained or provided with a supplemental water supply, or otherwise affected by the proposed improvement, and such other information as the board may request. The director of the department of water resources is authorized to employ such assistance as the character of the work requested of him may require, but before incurring any expense he shall file with the county commissioners an estimate of the amount of money required to perform such work and upon the approval by the county commissioners of such estimate, said amount shall be required to be deposited with the county treasurer as other deposits are herein required, the same to be used in paying the expense incurred by said director of the department of water resources in the performance of said work. Upon the filing of the report of the director of the department of water resources as herein provided, and upon receipt of notice of approval of the project by the director of the department of water resources said board shall within ten (10) days proceed in like manner as provided by law for the procedure of the board of county commissioners in calling and conducting other county bond elections, and in like manner as provided in the laws governing county bond elections for other purposes, shall canvass the returns of said election, and if two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified electors, as in this chapter provided, voting at such election shall be found to have voted in favor of authorizing such indebtedness or bond issue, then the board of county commissioners shall make and file for record in the office of the county recorder an order establishing such county irrigation or drainage project; shall proceed to apportion and assess the benefits of such proposed irrigation or drainage works or such proposed contract, to the lands to be benefited thereby and in making such apportionment of benefits shall proceed in like manner as provided by law for the proceedings of the directors of irrigation districts in apportioning benefits in irrigation districts, and in like manner as in the case of similar proceedings in irrigation districts shall file a petition in the district court for the confirmation of the apportionment of benefits, and the validity of the bond issue or contract, and the proceedings in connection with the holding of the election, and the apportionment of benefits; whereupon the district court shall proceed to set such petition for hearing and to hear the evidence in connection therewith and to decide the same in like manner and with like effect as provided by statute in the case of similar proceedings in irrigation districts. The said petition and decree may be either for the confirmation of all of said proceedings in one (1) decree or there may be separate and successive petitions and decrees for confirmation of any part of said proceedings and if the court finds the apportionment as made by the board of county commissioners to be equitable and just the court shall confirm the same and if the court finds the said apportionment or any part thereof to be inequitable or unjust the court shall itself make an equitable and just apportionment and file a decree confirming the same. An appeal may be taken from such decision of the district court to the Supreme Court either by the board of county commissioners or any of protesting landowners who have appeared in said proceedings in the district court in like manner as in similar cases in irrigation districts. The said decree of the district court may not be collaterally attacked, and if not set aside or modified by the Supreme Court, shall be final and conclusive as to the validity of the bond issue and the apportionment of benefits so confirmed, and the regularity and validity of all proceedings in connection with or leading up to the same.

     <p>
      The board of county commissioners of each and every county wherein any irrigation or drainage projects are proposed to be wholly or partially located and established, or wherein lands are located which are assessed for benefits by reason of the construction thereof, is hereby authorized after the filing of the decree of the district court confirming the election and other proceedings authorizing a bond issue of said county, to issue the bonds of their respective counties, and to be designed as “. . . . county improvement bonds” in such amounts as may be necessary to fully meet and discharge the expenses authorized by this chapter. All such bonds shall be the direct and primary obligations of the county for the full principal and interest thereof. The faith, credit, and all taxable property within the limits of the county, as constituted at the time of such issue, are, and must continue, pledged to the payment of said bonds. All such bonds shall be in the form provided in section 3524 of the Idaho Compiled Statutes and shall be sold negotiated as provided in section 3525 of the Idaho Compiled Statutes, and the board of county commissioners shall provide for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon in like manner as in the case of other county bonds and as set out and provided in section 3522 of the Idaho Compiled Statutes, but shall reimburse the county by enforcing all liens and collecting all assessments from the lands against which benefits have been assessed or apportioned under the provisions of this chapter. The word “expenses” shall be construed to mean and cover every item of cost of said irrigation or drainage project from the filing of the petition to the completion of work and all fees and expenses to be incurred in pursuance thereof. Such bonds shall be payable at such time or times not to exceed twenty (20) years from their date and shall bear such rate of interest payable annually or semiannually as the board of county commissioners shall by resolution determine. Each bond shall contain a recital that it is issued by authority of and in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and such bond may otherwise be in such form as the board of county commissioners may determine, but not in conflict with the requirements of section 3524 of the Idaho Compiled Statutes. Said board of county commissioners shall have power to sell and negotiate said bonds as hereinbefore provided. The proceeds from the sale of all such bonds shall be placed in a general reclamation fund which is hereby created in the county treasury. The county auditor shall keep a separate account with each irrigation or drainage project so established in such county, which account shall be credited with all moneys arising from the sale of bonds, all moneys received as interest or penalties upon liens, charges, assessments, and all other sources on account of such irrigation or drainage system, and which account shall be debited with every item of expenditure made on account of such irrigation or drainage project. Such board of county commissioners shall provide moneys for the payment of principal and interest of said bonds as they severally mature, which money shall be placed in the general reclamation fund into which fund it may transfer any surplus moneys remaining in the general revenue fund, or other funds of the county, which can be properly used for the purpose of this chapter, into which fund shall be paid all moneys received from the payment of any liens created under the provisions of this chapter, and such board is hereby authorized to pay such bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter, or the interest thereon, out of any available funds in the county treasury when the moneys on hand in the general reclamation fund of the treasury are insufficient to meet the payment of the bonds issued in irrigation or drainage proceedings under this chapter when the same mature. But the fund from which such moneys have been taken or used for the payment of bonds after they mature, shall be replenished with interest from the collections of unpaid assessments for irrigation or drainage works constructed under any proceedings had hereunder, as authorized in this chapter.

In case bonds shall be issued by the county then the lien shall bear the same rate of interest as such bonds. On or before the first day of October next following such filing of the lien in the office of the county recorder, the county auditor shall for the purpose of enforcing payment of such lien, enter on a project lien record of said county the whole amount of such lien remaining unpaid against each respective tract of land subject thereto, and shall at the same time, or before tax lists or tax rolls are turned over to the county tax collector, compute interest as in this chapter provided on such unpaid amount to the first day of July following and shall enter such interest on the tax list and tax rolls for such year and the installments of such lien and interest thereon together with such amount as may be required for the sinking fund as herein provided shall be collected in the same manner as real estate taxes for that year on the tract in question are collected, and the county auditor shall in the same manner each year thereafter compute interest on the amount of such lien remaining unpaid and not previously entered on the tax rolls of prior year, or years, together with interest to the first of July and enter the same together with the installment, if any, together with such amount as may be required for the sinking fund as herein provided then due on the tax lists and tax rolls, said installment, interest and sinking fund to be collected in like manner as the first payment until the whole amount of any such lien and accumulated interest shall have been so entered on the tax rolls and tax lists of such county, and all of the provisions of law now or hereafter existing in relation to the collection of real estate taxes so far as applicable hereto are hereby adopted for the purpose of enforcing payment of such liens and installments thereof and of the interest thereon, and each of the same shall be subject to the same penalties for delinquency in payment as provided by law for other county taxes. When payment of the full amount of such liens with accumulated interest shall thus, or at any one time, be made, the auditor upon presentation of a receipt from the treasurer to that effect, shall issue under his hand and official seal a certificate of such payment and the same when recorded in the office of the county recorder shall release and discharge said lien of record. If any item of cost of an irrigation or drainage project established under this chapter from the inception of such project to its completion has been, or shall be omitted from the original tabular statement for assessments made and filed by the auditor with the county recorder, then a supplementary statement or assessment shall be made by said auditor in the same form and manner as the original statement so far as practicable showing such omitted costs, which supplementary statement or assessment shall be filed for record in the office of the county recorder and shall be due and payable and collectible in the same manner, time and form as if a part of the last annual installment of the original assessment.

      In all cases in which a lien has been established against any tract or tracts of land comprising more than one government lot or forty-acre subdivision by reason of benefits assessed thereon in any irrigation or drainage project established under this chapter, and no installment of such assessment or interest thereon shall be in default, any person or corporation having an interest in said land, or any part thereof, may petition the district court of the county wherein such land is situated to have such lien apportioned between or among specified portions of such tract or tracts.

At the time and place appointed by the court for hearing upon such petition, or at the time to which such hearing may have been adjourned, the court shall hear any and all evidence bearing upon the matters set out in said petition and as to what will be a proper and equitable apportionment of said lien between or among the portions of such original tract which it is desired shall be encumbered by separate liens, and shall thereafter by its order apportion such lien among such tracts, but in no case shall the aggregate of said separate liens be different from the amount of the unpaid portion of the original lien. A certified copy of the order apportioning said lien shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of such county and filed in the office of the clerk of the district court, which shall operate as a division and apportionment of such original lien between such various tracts of land originally covered thereby, and shall operate as a release of each of said tracts from said lien, except the amount so apportioned against it and thereafter the amount apportioned to each of such respective tracts shall be entered separately against such tract upon the tax list and tax roll and so reported to the proper county officer for collection and no reduction or abatement of the amount so apportioned shall be thereafter made.

       <p>
        Upon the day fixed for the hearing of said petition, any persons or corporation interested therein, may appear before said court and make objections to the organization and incorporation of said district, but such objections shall be limited to determining whether or not the organization of such drainage district is a proper and advantageous method of accomplishing the reclamation and protection of the swamped, bogged or water-logged lands, or lands subject to overflow therein, and whether or not there is a reasonable probability that the objects sought by the formation of the district may be accomplished, and whether or not said proposed drainage system will be conducive either to the public health, welfare or convenience or increase the public revenue; and at the hearing the court shall hear and consider such evidence only as may be presented for or against the petition or objections thereto. Thereupon the court shall make its findings upon the facts alleged in the petition and objections and any other facts necessary and proper for the determination of the propriety of the organization of such district, and if said district be organized, the judge of said court shall cause an order to be entered and recorded in the judgment record of each of the counties in which the lands within said district are situated, setting forth the facts found by the said judge upon the hearing of said petition, and said order shall define the temporary boundaries of said district and describe the lands included therein by township, range and section only, and shall have the effect of a lis pendens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any district may be established even if it is shown that the outlet for the drainage system is without the county or counties in which said district is located, or without the boundaries of the state of Idaho, or is in any other state or territory, or in a foreign country; the work for the drainage of said district may be contracted for and performed either entirely or partially within the limits of any other state, territory or foreign country.

      § 42-2914. Examination of lands — Report of commissioners — Apportionment and reapportionment of benefits and damages.
     </h3>
     <p>
      As soon as may be after their appointment, or within such time as the court may direct, the commissioners shall examine the lands described in the petition and proposed to be drained and protected, and the lands over and upon which the work is proposed to be constructed and shall determine and report:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2914ol11">
       Whether the starting point, route and terminus of the proposed work and the proposed location thereof, is or are in all respects proper and feasible, and if not, what is or are so.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2914ol12">
       The estimated cost of the proposed work, including all incidental expenses and the cost of proceedings therefor.

      <li id="t42c29s42-2914ol13">
       The probable cost of keeping the same in repair after the work is completed.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2914ol14">
       What lands will be injured thereby and the aggregate amount of such injuries; and they shall award to each tract or lot, by whomsoever held, the amount of damage so determined by them.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2914ol15">
       What lands will be benefited by the construction of the proposed work, whether the benefits will equal or exceed the aggregate cost of constructing such work, including all incidental expenses, costs of proceedings and damages; and they shall apportion and assess the estimated cost of the same on the lands so benefited by setting opposite the correct description of each tract, lot or easement, the portion of such cost assessed as benefits thereon. And if any particular part of the work so proposed to be done shall be assessed upon any particular tracts or lots of land or upon any municipality or corporation they shall so specify; and if any municipality or corporation should in their judgment bear a part of the expense or as such will derive a public or special benefit from the whole or any part of such proposed work, they shall so report and assess the amount of such benefits.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2914ol16">
       Whether the proposed district, as set out in the petition filed, will embrace all the lands that may be damaged or benefited by the proposed work, and if not, what additional lands will be benefited or damaged and the amount of the benefits or damages in the same manner as though such lands were included in such original petition.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2914ol17">
       If the commissioners determine the lands benefited or the amount of said benefits has either changed or is in error, the commissioners may petition the court to reapportion the benefits to part or all of the lands within the district. Upon receipt of a petition, the court shall make and enter an order fixing a time and place when and where all persons interested may appear and object to the reapportionment of benefits, and the clerk of the court shall cause publication of the order in three (3) consecutive weekly issues in a newspaper of general circulation within each county in which any of the lands for which reapportionment of benefits is sought are located. Any landowner affected by the reapportionment of benefits may object against the whole or any part of the reapportionment pursuant to the provisions of section 42-2920, Idaho Code. Upon a hearing pursuant to the provisions of section 42-2921, Idaho Code, the court shall issue an order setting forth the reapportionment of benefits, if any.

        Prior to this section, benefits were to be assessed upon the principles governing special assessment in local improvement districts, that is, on basis of benefits received but this section authorizes assessments also based on the responsibility for injuries inflicted. Burt v. Farmers Coop. Irrigation Co., 30 Idaho 752, 168 P. 1078 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Benefits to low lands are to be determined in accordance with the enhanced value thereof and benefits to high lands are to be determined in accordance with the extent to which lands are responsible for damages to low lands by reason of seepage of irrigation water which contributes to the water-logged condition of such low lands and the amount of such responsibility is the proportion which the amount of water contributed by such high lands bears to the combined contribution of water from all sources by irrigation. Drainage Dist. No. 2 v. Extension Ditch Co., 32 Idaho 314, 182 P. 847 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any portion of the benefits to low lands from construction of drainage works arising from enhancement of value of such lands if they were in their natural state, or by changing conditions other than the damage caused by seepage and saturation from irrigation water, could not be considered in determining the assessment to be charged to the high lands. Drainage Dist. No. 2 v. Extension Ditch Co., 32 Idaho 314, 182 P. 847 (1919).
       </p>

The district court of said county shall fix a time for the hearing of the objections giving such proceedings preference over other civil actions pending, and on demand of any person or corporation assessed for the cost of construction or awarded damages, may impanel a jury and take its verdict upon the trial of such issue, whether the amount of damages awarded by the commissioners is adequate, or whether the assessment of any remonstrant demanding the review is too high, and the court or jury may assess the same.

        While it is true that an order complained of, involving waters in an irrigation district, may be reversed on appeal after a final judgment is entered, when it is made to appear that the order in question would probably entail bringing in a couple of hundred defendants and requiring that many answers, and the subsequent calling of a multitude of witnesses to sustain the issues tendered, and the consequent delay and expense it becomes apparent that the remedy by appeal is not adequate, and in these circumstances, a writ of prohibition to prevent the further proceedings under the order will issue.

A brief general notice of the filing of the application for confirmation of such additional levy shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the counties in which such district is situate, at least once each week, for three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the date fixed for confirmation.

      In case of the establishment of a drainage district and system of drainage under the provisions of this chapter above any other district that may theretofore have been established, and above any other system of drainage that may have theretofore been constructed in said district, and in case said district to be established above may desire to connect its drainage system with the lower or servient district, the latter district shall be made a party to the proceedings for the establishment of such system, and the petition to be filed in the district court for the establishment of the system of drainage in said upper district shall in addition to the facts hereinbefore provided and required to be set forth therein, set forth the fact that said lower system in said lower district is necessary to be used as an outlet for the system of drainage of said upper district, and that the same will be sufficient outlet and will afford sufficient capacity to carry the drainage of both said upper and lower districts; and in case said system of said lower district will be required to be enlarged by widening or deepening the same, or both, in order to give sufficient outlet to said upper district and afford sufficient drainage for said upper and lower districts, then the plans and specifications for enlarging the system of said lower district shall be filed with said petition in addition to the other data hereinbefore provided for in this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the landowners in said lower district, or any person claiming interest therein as mortgagee or otherwise, shall be made parties defendant in said petition, and the proceedings therein as to the assessment of damages and compensation for land taken, if any be necessary to be taken in enlarging said lower system, shall be the same as in the establishment of systems of drainage in the lower or servient district as hereinbefore provided for; but the jury, in addition to the facts to be found by them as provided for in the establishment of a drainage system in the lower district, shall find and determine whether said lower system, when improved according to the plans and specifications filed with the said petition, will afford sufficient drainage for both said upper and lower districts, which finding shall be made by the jury before considering any other question at issue in said proceedings, and in case said jury should find that the system of said lower district when improved as proposed in said petition would not be sufficient, then in that case said findings shall terminate the proceedings, and no further proceedings in said case shall be had, and the costs of said proceedings shall be paid as costs in other proceedings, as hereinbefore provided for; but in such case the finding of said jury shall not terminate the objects of said upper district or operate to disorganize the same, but said upper district may begin new proceedings for the establishment of a system of drainage with some new outlet provided therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      All costs for the enlarging or improving of said lower system that may be required, shall be assessed to the landowners in the upper district according to the benefits to be derived from the construction of said entire system, and no additional cost shall be thrown upon the lower district, and all compensation for taking any right of way that may be necessary to be taken in enlarging said lower system and all damages occurring therefrom, if any, to the landowners of said lower district, shall be ascertained and paid in the same manner as hereinbefore provided for the adjustment of compensation and damages in the establishment of drainage systems in lower districts.
    Said lower district, by and through its board of commissioners, may appear in said cause and show therein any injury it may sustain as a district by reason of the additional cost of maintenance per annum which will be sustained by said lower district by reason of said enlarging or improving of the same, and judgment shall be rendered in favor of said lower district against said upper district for such an amount as found, and the same shall be paid each year as the cost of construction is paid as provided for in this chapter, and the amount so paid shall be held by said lower district as an additional fund for the maintenance of its said system as improved and enlarged by said upper district.

      Upon the establishment of any drainage district under the provisions of this chapter, and the establishment of a system of drainage therein as provided for in this chapter, the board of commissioners of such drainage district are hereby authorized to issue bonds to pay for the total cost of the work and improvements incurred or to be incurred, or of the part of the work and improvements assumed or contracted for, or to be assumed or contracted for, together with the cost of the organization of said district, and the establishment thereof, including damages assessed and compensation made or to be made to landowners for right of way, and the expense and cost of the entire proceedings, payable as provided by section 42-2954[, Idaho Code]: provided, that no bonds shall, under the provisions hereof, be sold for less than their par value; and, provided further, that the total amount of the foregoing bonds shall not exceed ninety per cent (90%) of the assessments levied against the lands of the district for the payment of the cost and expense of the foregoing items.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners of any such drainage district is also hereby authorized to issue additional bonds, in an amount equal to, and payable from, the additional assessments which may be levied pursuant to and under the authorization expressed in section 42-2930[, Idaho Code].
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners of any such drainage district is also authorized to issue additional bonds sufficient in amount to pay the total cost of the additional work and improvements and of the separate and additional works and improvements authorized by the foregoing section 42-2931[, Idaho Code,] including the cost and expense of the costs of collection of the assessments therein authorized and of all legal and other proceedings incident to or had in connection with the ordering, authorization and doing of all such works and improvements by said board of commissioners or in connection with the court proceedings which shall be had under the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners of any such drainage district is also authorized to issue additional bonds sufficient in amount to pay and redeem all or any part of the outstanding warrant or other indebtedness of said district, together with interest accrued thereon. The funding hereby authorized may be accomplished by the exchange of such funding bonds for the warrant indebtedness or other indebtedness thus to be funded, if consented to by the board of commissioners and by the owners of such outstanding warrants and other indebtedness; provided that such funding bonds shall not bear a higher rate of interest than the warrants and other indebtedness thereby funded and that such funding bonds shall be exchanged at not less than their par value and accrued interest; provided, however, that no warrant or other indebtedness shall be funded under the provisions of this paragraph, except such warrants and other indebtedness which have been issued and incurred prior to July 1, 1935.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that the owners of such outstanding warrants and other indebtedness shall not consent to such exchange, such funding bonds shall be sold as required by section 42-2953[, Idaho Code], and such warrants and other outstanding indebtedness and obligations shall be called and retired as provided in said section 42-2953[, Idaho Code]; provided, that all funds in the treasury of such district available for the payment or redemption of such warrants and other indebtedness shall be first applied to the payment and redemption of such warrants and other indebtedness together with the interest accrued thereon, and such funding bonds shall be issued for the retirement of the indebtedness remaining unpaid.
    The foregoing bonds may be issued jointly or separately, as a unit bond issue or as separate bond issues as determined by the board of commissioners. Any or all of the bond issues authorized by this section may also be issued, if deemed advisable by the board of commissioners, as a part of a joint bond issue with drainage district refunding bonds authorized by and issued under the provisions of chapter 30 or under any other enabling acts of this state. The foregoing bonds shall be payable solely out of and from the assessments for benefits levied upon and a lien upon the lands within such drainage district, as provided elsewhere in this chapter; and all said assessments (as to the determination, apportionment and assessment thereof, objections thereto and hearing thereon and confirmation thereof, as to their nature and existence as a lien upon the lands thus assessed, as to appeals therefrom and their incontestability, as to the certification and entry thereof of record and upon the tax rolls of the county, as to collection thereof and as to tax sale of delinquent lands and redemption thereof, as to the times when such assessments shall become due and payable and be called and in what amounts, as to annual levies thereof for the liquidation of bonds at maturity and for the payment of interest thereon; and as to the mode, manner and time of doing all the foregoing, and in all other respects), shall be governed by, and shall be provided in, sections 42-2914, 42-2915, 42-2919 to 42-2929[, Idaho Code], inclusive and section 42-2934[, Idaho Code,] to section 42-2936[, Idaho Code], both inclusive, and sections 42-2956 and 42-2958[, Idaho Code], and the other related provisions, of chapter 29[, title 42, Idaho Code,] and as provided in this act.

      If at any time twenty per cent (20%) or more of the entire issued, uncalled and outstanding bonds of such district shall be past due and unpaid, after the application of all funds available for the payment thereof, then the numerical order, or other provisions of law, of payment of all outstanding and uncalled bonds of such district shall immediately cease, and thereafter the county treasurer shall distribute all funds coming into his hands applicable to the payment of bonds pro rata on all outstanding and uncalled bonds, whether due or to become due, to the end that after such default in the percentage herein set out, there shall be paid on each outstanding and uncalled bond its equal and ratable proportion of all funds so collected for the payment of said bonds; provided further, that if at the time of such default there shall be matured and unpaid interest on any or all of such outstanding bonds, then all moneys thereafter available for the payment of interest shall be applied toward the payment of interest longest in default until all bonds shall have assumed the same relative position in regard to interest payment. When interest shall have been paid on all outstanding bonds to the same date, thereafter all moneys available for the payment of interest shall be paid equally and ratably to the holders of all outstanding and uncalled bonds.

      <li id="t42c29s42-2982ol11">
       If the boards of commissioners of any two (2) or more drainage districts formed under this chapter deem it in the best interest of their respective districts that they be consolidated into a single district, and if said districts are contiguous or lie at least in part within the same county, such boards may petition the district court of the county in which a greater portion of the lands of said proposed district are located for an order consolidating the same districts. For purposes of this section, districts may be considered to be contiguous even though they are separated by a body of water or other natural barrier so long as they are located in close proximity to each other. The petition shall be a joint petition signed by a majority of the commissioners of each respective board and attested to by the secretary of each board. The petition shall set forth a description of the lands and boundaries for the respective districts, a description of the proposed consolidated district and any facts showing that the consolidation is in the best interests of said districts. The petition shall also set forth and report the total outstanding obligation bonds of each consolidating district, the total value of the assets held by each consolidating district, the total levy assessed in each consolidating district in its most recent fiscal year, and the projected total levy to be assessed for the next complete fiscal year in the proposed newly consolidated district.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2982ol12">
       Evidence showing that the proposed consolidation is in the best interests of the districts may include, but is not limited to: that which shows that the proposed system of drainage will be conducive to providing the same benefits previously apportioned to the lands within the respective districts, enhance the functioning of the respective districts, the public health, convenience and welfare, or increase the public revenue, or that the consolidation of said districts and the said system of drainage and reclamation is a proper and an advantageous method of accomplishing the relief sought.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2982ol13">
       Upon receiving a petition brought under this section, the district court shall fix a time and place for the hearing of the petition, and the time and manner of filing any objections to the petition. Said hearing shall be held no sooner than sixty (60) days and no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the first publication of notice of hearing. The clerk of the court shall cause publication of such order in three (3) consecutive weekly issues in a newspaper of general circulation within each county in which any of the lands within the said proposed consolidated district are located; together with a notice of the time and place at which the district court will consider said petition for consolidation. The petitioners shall pay all costs of publication.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c29s42-2982ol14">
       Any person objecting to a petition for consolidation as described in this section shall provide for filing of written objection with the court. Only landowners within the proposed consolidated district, owners of land over which the drainage water from the proposed district would flow, and landowners served by any of the respective districts included in the petition shall have standing to file an objection to said petition. Written objections must be filed and served upon petitioners no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date of the hearing. The form of the objection shall be as provided in the Idaho rules of civil procedure. Each objection shall identify the name of the landowner entering the objection along with the objecting party’s address, location of the landowner’s land by township, range and section; identify the district or districts in which those lands lie; and state the nature or description of objection and basis or reasoning for the objection. Objections shall be limited to determining whether or not the proposed consolidation is in the best interests of the districts.
    (5) The judge of the court shall, at the hearing herein provided, hear and consider argument from the petitioners and decide whether the proposed consolidation is in the best interests of said districts. The court shall then consider evidence in objection only from landowners who have filed a written objection as described in subsection (4) of this section, and only such evidence as may be presented for or against the petition or objections thereto. The landowners who have filed written objections shall bear the burden of proving that the consolidation is not in the best interests of the districts. After any evidence offered in opposition to the petition, the petitioners may offer evidence regarding the consolidation or in opposition to any objections entered. Based on the agreement in the petition to consolidate by the boards of the respective districts, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the proposed consolidation of the districts is in the best interests of the petitioning districts and the landowners therein, unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed consolidation is not in the best interests of the districts. Consolidation shall not be permitted to either exclude from the consolidated district lands that are within the petitioning districts or to include lands within the consolidated district that are not within the petitioning districts. The court shall make its determination wholly in the affirmative or negative whether said petitioning districts shall be consolidated.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (6) If the petition is granted, the court shall cause an order to be entered and recorded in the judgment record of each of the counties in which the lands within the consolidated district are situated, setting forth the facts found upon the hearing of said petition, and said order shall define the boundaries of said district and describe the lands included therein by township, range and section only. The clerk of said district court shall cause a copy of the order declaring said consolidated district, duly certified, to be filed in the office of the secretary of state. From the date of said filing and thereafter, said district consolidation shall be deemed complete.
     </p>
     <p>
      (7) The court shall name the commissioners appointed by it for the consolidated district pursuant to the provisions of section 42-2910, Idaho Code. In appointing commissioners to the newly consolidated district, the court shall consider preference to appointment of at least one (1) commissioner from each of the districts petitioning for consolidation. The consolidated district shall be known and described by the name and number of the largest district of those consolidated.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) The provisions of this section shall apply exclusively to the consolidation of drainage districts which have been formed under this chapter.

      The director shall, at the hearing herein provided, permit any person or corporation interested in the formation of the proposed district, or any of its objects or purposes, to appear and make objections to the organization of the district. The petition shall be prima facie evidence of proponents of the formulation of the district, although such petitioners may withdraw their names at said hearings, or as is otherwise provided by law.

      If the director shall recommend that said district be organized, he shall make and enter an order and record the same in the office of the county recorder of each county wherein the lands of the said district thereof are located. The order shall set forth facts as found by him upon the hearing of the petition. Upon entering and recording the order, in the manner provided, the district shall be considered as organized.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the director shall recommend against the organization of the district at the hearing, but shall recommend the formulation of a district materially different from that prayed for in the petition filed with him, there shall be no further proceedings thereon, unless the director be requested so to do by one-third (1/3) of the qualified voters therein in the same manner as provided herein for the filing of the original petition, and upon the filing of such petition the director shall be required to comply with this act as if such petition had been filed with him in the first instance.

     <p>
      The order of the director organizing said district shall name the members of the board without regard to political affiliation. Each division of the district shall be represented by one (1) commissioner who shall be a qualified voter within the division which he represents, and a resident and qualified elector of the county in which he resides.
     </p>
     <p>
      The members of the board of the district, appointed as aforesaid, shall be entitled to enter upon the duties of their office upon qualification as county officers are required to qualify, and upon each commissioner giving a bond to the state for the benefit of said district for the faithful performance of his duties as such commissioner in the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) with one (1) or more sureties, or a surety bond, the premium for which shall be a lawful expenditure of the district, either of which shall be approved by the judge of the district court wherein the commissioner resides; provided, the judge of the district court, upon application and proper showing by the board may enter an order reducing the amount of the bond to such sum as may appear to him to be reasonable and adequate under the showing made. The commissioners shall take the oath of office and file their bonds within fifteen (15) days after they are appointed and they shall hold office until their successors are duly appointed and qualified as in this act provided. The bonds of the commissioners shall be filed with the clerk of the district court of the county in which the office of the district is located and kept in trust by said clerk of the district court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immediately after their appointment and the filing and approval of their bonds the commissioners shall organize themselves into a board, as in this act provided, and shall by lot determine the terms of their office, which shall be one (1), two (2) and three (3) years, respectively. Annually thereafter the director shall appoint the commissioner, or commissioners, to succeed those whose terms of office are expiring. Such appointments shall be for three (3) years, provided that each division of the district shall be represented by one (1) commissioner who shall be a qualified voter within the division which he represents, and a resident and qualified elector of the county in which he resides.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director may remove a commissioner for neglect of duty, misconduct or malfeasance or inability to perform the duties of a commissioner, or if the commissioner is no longer a resident of the division from which appointed. The director may appoint a successor for the unexpired term.

     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of such election must be given as provided in section 34-1406, Idaho Code. The notice must specify the date of the holding of the election, the qualification of the voters, the nature of the contract set forth in general terms, and by reference shall give notice as to where a copy of such contract, proposed to be entered into, may be viewed by the qualified voters, one (1) of which places shall be with each of the commissioners of the district and such other places as the board may determine by their order. Said notice shall further set forth the amount of the contract, the amount of the funds, if any, which will be received from the United States, and/or the state, the amount that the district will be obligating itself to pay, the duration of construction and obligation of such contract, the estimate of the mill levy required for operation, maintenance and administrative expenses of the district, whether such obligation may be met, within the limitations imposed by the levy authorized by this chapter, or whether, in addition to voting upon the contract it will be necessary to vote upon an increase in the authorized levy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice shall further state the hours between which the polls will be open, the definite place or places of holding the election, which shall be fixed by the board by its order, which order will require at least one (1) polling place in every division of the district, and the question to be voted upon.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ballot shall contain the question to be voted upon and shall contain the words “Contract-Yes” and “Contract-No,” or other words equivalent.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event such contract requires the district to call for a levy beyond the limitations imposed in section 42-3115, Idaho Code, then the ballot shall contain the question to be voted upon and shall contain the words “Contract and Levy-Yes” and “Contract and Levy-No” or other words equivalent.
     </p>

      § 42-3127. Exclusion of a division.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The qualified electors residing in a division of a flood control district may petition the director of the department of water resources requesting to be excluded from a district. Said petition must be signed by one-third (1/3) or more of the qualified electors residing within the territory of the division and the petition must:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c31s42-3127ol11">
       Show that the division either plans to join another existing district or form a new district.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c31s42-3127ol12">
       Describe the impacts on the remainder of the district after the division is excluded.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c31s42-3127ol13">
       Describe the benefits to the division that will result from its exclusion from the original district.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c31s42-3127ol14">
       Be in proper form as required by section 42-3105, Idaho Code, to proceed with the formation of a new district or be in proper form as required by section 42-3120, Idaho Code, to proceed with the addition of the division to an already existing district.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c31s42-3127ol15">
       Present an equitable division of assets and liabilities between the division and the remaining district.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Upon receipt, the director shall examine the petition, and if in proper form and if it appears that an equitable distribution of assets and liabilities can be made, the director shall proceed with the publication of notice, as described in section 42-3107, Idaho Code. The director shall, at the hearing, permit any person or corporation interested in the exclusion of the division to appear and present testimony and evidence in support of or against exclusion of the division. The director shall base his findings upon allegations in the petition, testimony and evidence presented at the hearing and any other facts necessary for the determination of the practicability and feasibility of exclusion of the division.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the director shall recommend that a division should be excluded, he shall make and enter his findings in the form of a petition to the district court for the county in which the largest portion of the division is located. The district court may then order the exclusion of a division.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the director shall determine that a division should not be excluded, nothing further shall be done, unless a new petition is filed in a similar manner as described above.
     </p>
     <p>
      At such time as the division is excluded by the district court, the new district or enlargement of an existing district shall be ordered by the director in accordance with section 42-3108, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director may redivide the district from which the division was excluded in order to meet the requirements of section 42-3106, Idaho Code.

      The actual or potential development anticipated for said district shall be predominantly recreational in character. The district or areas near the district shall meet one (1) or more of the following criteria: have unique scenic value; man-made or natural recreational facilities such as waterways, marinas, ski slopes, wilderness areas; provide open space; and be removed from large, densely populated urban areas. Recreational water and/or sewer districts shall provide services and/or facilities to landowners or state lessees or federal permittees. The proposed district shall be in the best interests of the state of Idaho in that the benefits derived by property owners shall effectuate the preservation and development of recreational opportunities within the state.

      The board of directors of a water and/or sewer district may, at any time after the formation of such district, determine that the district qualifies as a recreational water and/or sewer district as defined under section 42-3202A, Idaho Code, and that it is in the best interest of the district to petition the court to change the district’s status to a recreational water and/or sewer district. Said petition must be filed in the office of the clerk of the court vested with jurisdiction, in a county in which the major part of the real property in the existing district is situated. The petition must be signed by the chairman of the district’s board of directors and shall set forth the following:

Further, if it then shall appear that the petition for a change in status has been signed and presented as hereinabove provided and the allegations of the petition are true, the court shall by order duly entered of record, grant the prayed for change of status of the existing district.

      § 42-3207. Hearings on petitions — Election for organization and directors.
     </h3>
     <p>
      On the day fixed for such hearing or at any adjournment thereof the court shall ascertain from the tax rolls of the county or counties in which the district is located or into which it extends, the total number of taxpayers within the proposed district, who pay a general tax on real property owned by him or her within the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court finds that no petition has been signed and presented in conformity with this chapter, or that the material facts are not as set forth in the petition filed, it shall dismiss said proceedings and adjudge the costs against the signers of the petition in such proportion as it shall deem just and equitable. No appeal or writ of error shall lie from an order dismissing said proceedings; but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the filing of a subsequent petition or petitions for similar improvements or for a similar district, and the right so to renew such proceedings is hereby expressly granted and authorized.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any time after the filing of the petition for the organization of a district and before the day fixed for the hearing thereon, the owner or owners of any real property within the proposed district may file a petition with the court stating reasons why said property should not be included therein, why his land or any part thereof will not be benefited by the proposed district, or should not be embraced in said district and made liable to taxation therefor, and praying that said property be excluded therefrom. Such petition shall be duly verified and shall describe the property sought to be excluded. The court shall conduct a hearing on said petition and shall hear all objections to the inclusion in the district of any lands described in said petition. In case any owner of real estate included in said proposed district shall satisfy the court that his real estate, or any part thereof, has been wrongfully included therein or will not be benefited thereby then the court shall exclude such real estate as will not be benefited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon said hearing, if it shall appear that a petition for the organization of a district has been signed and presented as hereinabove provided, in conformity with this chapter, and the allegations of the petition are true, the court shall, by order duly entered of record, direct that the question of the organization of the district shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such election shall be held in conformity with the general election in this state, including chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code, except that the court shall establish as many election precincts within such proposed district as are deemed necessary, and shall define the boundaries thereof, which precincts and boundaries may thereafter be changed by the county commissioners if the district is organized.
     </p>
     <p>
      At any time after the filing of the petition herein referred to and before the day fixed for hearing, nominees for the board of directors of the district may be nominated by the filing of a petition designating the name or names of the nominee or nominees, signed by at least five (5) qualified electors of the district. If upon the hearing as herein provided the court shall order an election for the creation of the district, the court shall also ascertain the names of persons nominated by the board of directors, and shall order that the names of persons whom the court finds to have been properly nominated shall be listed upon a ballot submitted to the electors at such election. In the event the court makes its order providing for such election, it shall prescribe the form of the question and ballot relating to the creation of the district, and also the form of the ballot relating to the election of the directors; provided that all matters may be contained upon one (1) ballot to be submitted to the voters.
    At such election the voters shall vote for or against the organization of the district, and for five (5) qualified electors, who shall constitute the board of directors of the district, if organized, one (1) director to act until the first biennial election, two (2) until the second, and two (2) until the third biennial election.
     </p>
     <p>
      The judges of election shall certify the returns of the election to the district court having jurisdiction. If a majority of the votes cast at said election are in favor of the organization, the district court shall declare the district organized and give it a corporate name by which, in all proceedings, it shall thereafter be known, and designated the first board of directors elected, and thereupon the district shall be a governmental subdivision of the state of Idaho and a body corporate with all the powers of a public or quasi-municipal corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an order be entered establishing the district, such order shall be deemed final and no appeal or writ of error shall lie therefrom, and the entry of such order shall finally and conclusively establish the regular organization of the said district against all persons except the state of Idaho, in an action in the nature of a writ of quo warranto, commenced by the attorney general within thirty (30) days after said decree declaring such district organized as herein provided, and not otherwise. The organization of said district shall not be directly or collaterally questioned in any suit, action or proceeding except as herein expressly authorized.

        The provision of this section prior to 1957 amendment requiring residents and qualified electors to be taxpayers before voting at an organizational election was an unconstitutional requirement inasmuch as no qualifications are ever to be required for any person to vote or hold office except in school elections or in irrigation district elections.

(2) Upon filing with the board of a petition signed by registered voters owning real property residing in the territory to be annexed, who constitute at least twenty percent (20%) of the taxpayers in such territory, praying for an election to determine if annexation shall be made of property designated in such petition, together with payment of a reasonable filing fee in an amount to be determined by the board, the board shall cause notice of filing of such petition to be given and published in the county in which the property is situated, which notice shall state the filing of such petition, names of petitioners, descriptions of lands to be annexed and the prayer of such petition; giving notice to all persons interested, including the staff and employees of said district and anyone designated by said district to appear at the office of the board at the time named in said notice and show cause in writing, if any they have, why the petition shall not be granted. The board shall at the time and place mentioned or at such time or times to which the hearing may be adjourned, proceed to hear the petition and all objections thereto, presented, in writing, by any person showing cause why said petition shall not be granted. The board shall have full discretion to determine if the petition shall be granted, and if such petition is granted, the board shall direct that an election be held, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code. The election shall be conducted in the same manner as general elections in this state, except that the board shall establish as many voting places within such territory proposed to be annexed as are by the board deemed necessary and shall define the boundaries of such voting places. The board shall appoint three (3) judges of election for each voting place, one (1) of whom shall be designated by the board to be the clerk of such election precinct. Each elector shall be registered as required by the general election laws and shall have resided within the area to be annexed for thirty (30) days.
    The secretary of the board of directors shall publish notice of the time and place of such election, in accordance with the provisions of section 34-1406, Idaho Code. The notice shall particularly describe the property to be annexed, the name of the district to which the territory is proposed to be annexed, and the terms and conditions prescribed by the board under which the property may be annexed. The notice shall designate the places in the territory where the election will be held, and shall require the voters to cast ballots which shall contain the words:
      </li>
      <li id="t42c32s42-3218ol1c">
       In all proceedings for inclusion or annexation hereunder, the board shall have the power to prescribe terms and conditions under which said property may be included in the district, including the condition that such property may only be annexed or included within the district if the property is also established as a water or sewer subdistrict of the district, pursuant to sections 42-3218A through 42-3218D, Idaho Code, and may be required to pay the district its pro rata share of construction costs theretofore incurred by the district pursuant to any bond issue theretofore made or otherwise; provided, however, that such terms and conditions shall be announced by the board at or before the hearing to be held pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. Within ten (10) days of the announcement of the terms and conditions under which the property may be included the majority of the petitioners filing petitions under the provisions of subparagraphs (a) or (b) may withdraw their petitions, and no further proceedings shall thereafter be had by the board upon such petitions.
    (d) All public streets, roads, highways or alleys upon or within which is situated any part of the operative system or equipment of the district and all public streets, roads, highways and alleys which abut against or touch property annexed or to be annexed to the district, to the extent they abut against or touch such property and are not included in a different district, shall be deemed to be included in the district as a part of the annexation and shall be included in the legal description and map which the district must file in the offices of the county assessor, county recorder and the state tax commission as required by section 63-215, Idaho Code; provided, however, that upon application by the district to the state tax commission, if the commission finds after consultation with the county assessor and the county recorder that exemption from the requirements of this subparagraph (d) will not unduly burden state and local tax administration, the commission by order may exempt the district from the requirements of this subparagraph (d), but the district shall be required to comply with section 63-215, Idaho Code.

      The judges of the election shall make their return thereof to the board of directors of the district, which shall canvass the returns and render a statement of the results of the election on the records of the board. If the majority of the votes cast favor annexation, the board shall enter an order annexing the property described in the notice of election and the territory shall thereupon become annexed to the district and shall thenceforth be a part of the district.

      Upon rejection by the district electorate of substantially the same proposal in two (2) separate elections for the creation of indebtedness for the purpose of acquisition, construction, installation or completion of any works or other improvements or facilities or the making of any contract to carry out the purposes of the district, and after denial by the board of a petition for exclusion of property filed and heard, as provided under section 42-3219[, Idaho Code], the owners in fee, or their representatives, of real property located in the district may petition the district court of the judicial district in which the majority of the property subject of said petition is located for exclusion and removal of their lands from such water and sewer district. Such petition shall be signed by not less than fifty-one per cent (51%) of the qualified electors of the area to be excluded from the district, shall include a legal description of the real property, the subject of said petition, shall be acknowledged in the same manner and form as required in case of a conveyance of land and shall be accompanied by a deposit of money sufficient to pay all costs of the exclusion and removal proceedings.

Such notice shall state the date of filing of such petition and the names of the petitioners, shall include a legal description of the property mentioned in said petition, shall set forth the prayer of said petitioners, and shall notify all persons interested to appear at the deisgnated [designated] court at the time stated in said notice, showing cause in writing, if any they have, why said petition should not be granted.

      The court shall grant such petition upon finding that said proposals for the creation of indebtedness were twice rejected by the electors of the whole district, and upon the finding that said real property so designated by the petition for exclusion and removal forms a contiguous area and either has no need for water and sewage disposal services or reasonably constitutes a separate area for purposes of water and sewage disposal services.

     <p>
      The board of directors of the district may, upon rejection by the district electorate of substantially the same proposal in two (2) separate elections (whether held prior to or after enactment of this section) for the creation of indebtedness for the purpose of acquisition, construction, installation or completion of any works or other improvement or facilities or the making of any contract to carry out the purposes of the district, petition the district court of the judicial district in which the majority of the property subject of the petition is located for exclusion and removal of lands from such water and sewer district. Such petition shall include a general description of the boundaries of the area to be excluded from the district with such certainty as to enable a property owner to determine whether or not his property is within the area to be excluded and shall be verified. The board of directors of the district, as petitioners, shall cause notice of filing of such petition to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which said property, or the major portion thereof is located, once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks. Such notice shall state the date of filing of such petition, shall include a description of the boundaries of the area to be excluded from the district with such certainty as to enable a property owner to determine whether or not his property is within the area to be excluded, and shall notify all persons interested to appear at the designated court at the time stated in said notice, showing cause in writing, if any they have, why said petition should not be granted. At any time before the expiration of the time of publication, any person may file his objection to said petition. At the time and place designated in the notice, or at the time or times at which the hearing of said petition may be adjourned, the court shall proceed to hear the petition and all objections thereto presented in writing by any person showing cause as aforesaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court shall grant such petition upon finding that said proposals for the creation of indebtedness were twice rejected by the electors of the whole district, and upon the finding that said area so designated by the petition for exclusion and removal forms a contiguous area and either has no need for water or sewage disposal services or reasonably constitutes a separate area for purposes of water and sewage disposal services; or is of such location and character that water or sewage disposal services cannot be furnished to it by such water and sewer district at reasonable cost and that the withdrawal of such area will be conducive to the general welfare of the balance of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The granting of such petition by the court and such exclusion of said property from the district shall not relieve such property from paying any bond indebtedness of the district existing at the time of said exclusion order against any such property so excluded, nor shall the granting of such petition and exclusion of such property relieve such property of any levy for the support of said district for the year in which it is removed.
    The procedure for the exclusion and removal of lands from a water and sewer district as provided in this section shall be an alternative to the procedures provided in sections 42-3219 and 42-3219A, Idaho Code.

      Whenever any board shall, by resolution, determine that the interest of said district and the public interest or necessity demand the acquisition, construction, installation or completion of any works or other improvements or facilities, or the making of any contract with the United States or other persons or corporations, public or private, municipalities, or governmental subdivisions, to carry out the objects or purposes of said district, requiring the creation of an indebtedness that will exceed the income and revenue provided for the year, said board shall order the submission of the proposition of issuing such obligations or bonds, or creating other indebtedness to the qualified electors of the district at an election held, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, for that purpose. The declaration of public interest or necessity herein required and the provision for the holding of such election may be included within one and the same resolution, which resolution, in addition to such declaration of public interest or necessity, shall recite the objects and purposes for which the indebtedness is proposed to be incurred, the estimated cost of the works or improvements, as the case may be, the amount of principal of the indebtedness to be incurred therefor, and the maximum rate of interest to be paid on such indebtedness. Such resolution shall also fix the date upon which such election shall be held and the manner of holding the same and the method of voting for or against the incurring of the proposed indebtedness. Such resolution shall also fix the compensation to be paid the officers of the election and shall designate the polling place or places and shall appoint, for each polling place from the electors of the district, the officers of such election consisting of three (3) judges, one (1) of whom shall act as clerk.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Should congress by virtue of the authority vested in it under article 1, section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, providing for compacts and agreements between states, ratify the following as a definite compact and agreement between the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, then, and in that event, there shall exist between the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho a compact and agreement, the purport of which shall be substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact states acknowledge that they have a common interest in the conservation and management of anadromous fish stocks in the Columbia River drainage and they mutually agree to assume joint responsibility in developing sports and commercial fishery programs and regulations which will maintain and preserve the resource for the interest and benefit of all users.
     </p>
     <p>
      Membership from the compact states shall be the Idaho department of fish and game, the fish commission of the state of Oregon, Oregon wildlife commission, Washington department of fisheries and the Washington department of game or the successor agency to any of the above. The compact members may appoint advisors to serve as needed.
     </p>
     <p>
      All rules and regulations now existing or which may be necessary for the conservation and management of anadromous fish in the waters of the main stem of the Columbia River from its mouth to the mouth of the Snake River and the waters of the main stem of the Snake River from its mouth to the mouth of the Salmon River, shall be made, changed, altered and amended in whole or in part by a majority vote. In voting on rules and regulations, each state shall be entitled to one (1) vote. Idaho will vote only on those regulations which might have a substantial impact on fish destined for Idaho waters.
     </p>
     <p>
      The individual states shall be responsible for the management of anadromous fish stocks in pertinent tributary streams and shall be guided in such management by the intent and purpose of this compact.

      Upon the receipt of any application with accompanying plans, it shall be the duty of the director to examine same and to furnish copies of the application and plans to, and consult with, other state agencies having an interest in the stream channel to determine the likely effect of the proposed stream channel alteration upon the fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty, and water quality values of the stream. The director shall furnish a copy of each application and all accompanying materials to the department of lands. Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of copies of such application and plans from the director, such other state agencies shall notify the director whether the proposed stream channel alteration will have an unreasonably detrimental effect upon these stream values and shall include with such notification recommendations of alternate plans, if any, determined by such agency to be reasonable to accomplish the purpose of the proposed stream channel alteration without adversely affecting such stream values.

     <p>
      Based upon his own investigation and the recommendations and alternate plans of other state agencies, the director shall prepare and forward to the applicant his decision approving the application in whole or in part or upon conditions, or rejecting the application. With regard to applications which could, if issued, affect endowment lands, the director shall deny such applications upon the objection of the state department of lands, or modify the same as recommended by the department. Within fifteen (15) days of the date of mailing of the decision, the applicant shall notify the director if it refuses to modify its plans in accordance with such decision or that it requests a hearing before the board thereon. If requested, such hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and rules adopted by the board. The board shall have power to administer oaths and to require the attendance of such witnesses and the production of such books, records and papers as it may desire at the hearing, and for that purpose, the board may apply to the court for subpoena for any witnesses or a subpoena duces tecum to compel the production of any books, records or papers which shall be served and returned in the same manner as a subpoena in a civil case. In case of any disobedience or neglect to obey a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum, it shall be the duty of the district court in any county of this state in which disobedience, neglect or refusal occurs, or any judge thereof, on application by the board, to compel obedience by proceedings for contempt. Upon the conclusion of the hearing and completion of any investigation conducted by the director the board shall enter its findings in writing approving the decision of the director on the application and plans in whole or in part, or upon conditions, or rejecting the decision of the director on said application and plans for such proposed stream channel alteration.
     </p>
     <p>
      A copy of the board’s findings on the director’s decision shall be mailed to the applicant and to each person or organization who appeared at the hearing and gave testimony in support of or in opposition to the proposed stream channel alteration. Any applicant or other person appearing at a hearing shall have the right to have the proceedings of the board and the decision of the director reviewed by the district court in the county where the stream channel alteration is proposed. With the exception that the matter may be reviewed by the district court in the county where the stream channel alteration is proposed, judicial review shall be had pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.

      If the director of the department of water resources determines the use of the proposed or existing injection well will not affect the rights of others to use water for beneficial purposes shall issue a permit approving the construction, modification or continued operation of such well. Such permit shall contain conditions, if any, determined to be necessary to protect the public interest in the ground water resource including, but not limited to, the method and manner of operation of the injection well, the period during which the injection well may be operated, a date when such permit shall expire, and periodic reports to the department of water resources of the quality and quantity of the fluids injected. No deep injection well or shallow injection well, as may be required by rules and regulations adopted under this chapter, shall be used unless a valid permit is in effect in accordance with this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director shall require, as a condition of every class II injection well permit, that every person who engages in the construction, modification or operation of a well provides evidence of good and sufficient security in the form of a bond, letter of credit or other surety acceptable to the director that ensures that the applicant performs the duties required pursuant to this chapter and properly decommission any well covered by such permit. Good and sufficient security for each injection well shall be in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) plus one dollar ($1.00) per foot of depth. The security shall be conditioned upon the performance of the owner’s or operator’s duty to comply with the rules of the water resource board with respect to the construction, modification, operation, plugging and decommissioning of each well. The security shall remain in full force and effect until the plugging and decommissioning of the well is approved by the director or the security is released by the director. Well decommissioning shall include reclamation of the well site so that the site is left in a stable, noneroding condition with no impact to any ground water or surface water sources of the state. The director may require additional security of an owner or operator given sufficient reason, such as noncompliance, unusual conditions or other circumstances that suggest a particular well has potential risk or liability in excess of that normally expected.

      If the director of the department of water resources determines the use of the proposed or existing injection well will interfere or is interfering with the right of the public to withdraw water for beneficial uses, and the director finds there are no overriding needs existing to justify the use of the injection well, the director may reject the application and forward notice of such rejection to the owner or operator by certified mail.

For purposes of such hearing the water resource board shall have power to administer oaths, examine witnesses, and issue in the name of the board subpoenas requiring testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter in the hearing. A certified transcript of the proceedings and the evidence received at such hearing shall be maintained by the board. The board shall affirm, modify or reject the director’s decision, and make its decision in the form of an order to the director. Judicial review of a final determination by the board may be secured by the owner or operator by filing a petition for review as prescribed by chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, in the district court of the county wherein the injection well is situated. The petition for review shall be served upon the chairman of the water resource board and upon the attorney general as provided by the Idaho rules of civil procedure.

      § 42-3910. Cancellation of permit — Notice — Hearing — Review.
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the director of the department of water resources has reason to believe the operation and use of an injection well, for which a permit has been issued in accordance with this chapter, is interfering with the right of the public to withdraw water for beneficial uses, or is causing unreasonable contamination or deterioration of the quality of the ground water below the adopted water quality standards of the board of environmental quality, he may cancel such permit. Prior to the cancellation of such permit there shall be a hearing before the water resource board for the purpose of determining whether or not the permit should be cancelled. At such hearing the director of the department of water resources shall be the complaining party. For purposes of such hearing, the board shall have power to administer oaths, examine witnesses and issue subpoenas requiring testimony of witnesses and production of evidence relevant to any matter in the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and the board shall provide the owner or operator whose permit is proposed to be cancelled with reasonable notice and the opportunity to be heard in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. A certified transcript of the proceedings and the evidence received at such hearing shall be maintained by the board. The board shall affirm, modify or reject the director’s decision, and make its decision in the form of an order to the director. Review of a final determination by the board may be secured by the owner or operator by filing a petition for review as prescribed by chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, in the district court of the county wherein the injection well is situated. The petition for review shall be served upon the chairman of the water resource board and upon the attorney general as provided by the Idaho rules of civil procedure.

       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 1972, ch. 301 read: “It is hereby declared that the state of Idaho claims the right to regulate the development and use of all of the geothermal resources within this state and that geothermal resources are natural resources of limited quantity and of a unique value to all of the people of the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The legislature of the state of Idaho further declares that the geothermal resources of this state may provide an outstanding opportunity for enhancement of our economy and quality of life with a minimum of environmental degradation through a utilization of this energy source. It is also recognized that the process of utilization and development of our geothermal resources on a large scale may be associated with risks to the maximum sustained yield from these resources, risks to our valuable groundwater resources, and risks to the environment in the immediate locality of and around the installations at which such utilization is done.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The legislature further finds that there is presently substantial interest in the geothermal resources of this state, that regulation in the public interest is imperative, and that regulation must take effect at an early date.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The legislature does therefore declare that it is the policy and purpose of this state to maximize the benefits to the entire state which may be derived from the utilization of our geothermal resources, while minimizing the detriments and costs of all kinds which could result from their utilization. This policy and purpose is embodied in this act which provides for the immediate regulation of geothermal resource exploration and development in the public interest.”

All or part of any issue may be refunded and all or part of several issues may be refunded into a single issue of refunding bonds. There may be included with the refunding bonds, as part of a single issue, or in combination in one or more series, bonds for any other purpose or purposes for which bonds are authorized to be issued under the water and sewer district revenue bond act. Refunding bonds shall be issued and secured in such manner as may be provided in the proceedings authorizing their issuance and as otherwise provided in the water and sewer district revenue bond act, and such changes may be made in the security and revenue pledged to the payment of the bonds so refunded, as provided by the governing body in the proceedings authorizing such bonds. No election on the issuance of refunding bonds shall be required, but if by an increase in the amount of bonds or by changes in the security or pledged revenues, the requirements of the constitution for an election shall become applicable, or if refunding bonds are combined into a single issue with bonds authorized for nonrefunding purposes, then such bonds with changes in security or revenues, or such bonds in excess of the amount of bonds refunded, as the case may be, must have been approved at an election as otherwise provided in the water and sewer district revenue bond act and the constitution. Refunding bonds may be exchanged for not less than a like principal amount of bonds authorized to be refunded, may be sold, or may be exchanged in part and sold in part. If sold, the proceeds of the sale, not required for the payment of expenses, and in any event, in an amount sufficient to assure the retirement of the bonds refundable, when such bonds become available for retirement, if not applied to a simultaneous payment and cancelation of the bonds refunded shall be escrowed with a bank or trust company and may be invested in United States government obligations or in obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America in such manner as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings.

       The welfare of the people of the state of Idaho is dependent upon the conservation, development, augmentation and optimum use of the water resources of this state. The legislature deems it essential therefore that every effort be made to foster and encourage water projects designed to promote these objectives. The legislature hereby acknowledges that the proposed project to recharge ground water basins in Jerome, Lincoln and Gooding counties by means of the storage of unappropriated waters of the Snake River and its tributaries in underground lava beds within that vicinity represents a unique and innovative endeavor to further water conservation and increase the water available for beneficial use. The legislature approves this undertaking as a pilot effort to bring about maximum realization of our water resource potential and finds, in particular, that this project shall serve the interests of the public and advance the multiple use water policy of this state by:

      <li id="t42c42s42-4201ol12">
       In view of the public betterment to be achieved by the completion of this water project, the legislature hereby declares that the appropriation and underground storage of water by the aquifer recharge district hereinafter created for purposes of ground water recharge shall constitute a beneficial use and hereby authorizes the department of water resources to issue to the aquifer recharge district a permit, pursuant to section 42-203 [42-203A], Idaho Code, for the appropriation and underground storage of the unappropriated waters of the Snake River in Jerome, Lincoln and Gooding counties and its tributaries in Gooding and Lincoln counties. The department of water resources is further authorized to issue to the aquifer recharge district a license confirming the right to appropriate such waters for the beneficial use herein established upon compliance by the district with the requirements specified in chapter 2, title 42, Idaho Code. The rights acquired by the aquifer recharge district pursuant to any permit and license obtained as herein authorized shall be secondary to all prior perfected water rights, including those held by any privately-owned electrical generating company to appropriate waters in the reaches of the Snake River downstream from the Milner diversion for purposes of hydroelectric power generation.
    (3) The director of the department of water resources may regulate the amount of water which the aquifer recharge district may appropriate from the Snake River and may reduce such amount, even though there is sufficient water to supply the entire amount originally authorized, but only if the following conditions are met:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t42c42s42-4201ol12a">
         the amount of water available for appropriation by the district at the time the reduction is sought exceeds two hundred thousand (200,000) acre feet per year and the reduction, if granted, will not operate to deplete that amount to less than two hundred thousand (200,000) acre feet per year;
        </li>
        <li id="t42c42s42-4201ol12b">
         the persons or entities seeking the reduction propose to use the water for purposes of surface reservoir storage and appropriation by the district of the entire amount originally authorized will prevent or adversely affect accomplishment of those purposes;
        </li>
        <li id="t42c42s42-4201ol12c">
         the persons or entities seeking the reduction present substantial and compelling evidence to show that the accomplishment of such purposes will be prevented or adversely affected and the director finds on the basis of such evidence that sufficient justification for the reduction exists.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Even if the foregoing conditions are satisfied and a reduction is granted, such a reduction shall remain in effect only so long as the amount of water available for appropriation by the district exceeds two hundred thousand (200,000) acre feet per year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to appropriation of water by the district from the Big Wood River or the Little Wood River.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) To insure that other water rights are not injured by the operations of the aquifer recharge district, the director of the department of water resources shall have the authority to approve, disapprove, or require alterations in the methods employed by the district to achieve ground water recharge. In the event that the director determines that the district’s methods of operation are adversely affecting existing water rights or are creating conditions adverse to the beneficial use of water under existing water rights, the director shall order the cessation of operations until such alterations as may be ordered by the director have been accomplished or such adverse effects otherwise have been corrected.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) The fee required for an application for a permit to appropriate water as provided in section 42-221, Idaho Code, is hereby waived from the effective date of this act until July 1, 1997, for recharge projects for recharge districts formed under this section.

     <p>
      For purposes of formation of the aquifer recharge district, a petition shall be presented to the department of water resources which shall set forth the object of the organization of the district and the benefits to be provided by the district. The petition shall be accompanied by a map of the proposed district which shall indicate the proposed boundaries of the district, the nature and location of the proposed diversion works and other facilities by means of which water is to be diverted into the recharge area, shall delineate the underground water basin or basins to be affected by the recharge, and shall designate the location of any streams or springs which shall be affected by the recharge. The petition and map shall be accompanied by a statement describing the details of the contemplated diversion works and facilities and an estimate of the cost of constructing such works and facilities, which statement and estimates shall be certified to by an engineer licensed by the state of Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall be signed by no less than fifty (50) percent of the water users located within the proposed boundaries of the district. For purposes of this act, “water users” shall include the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c42s42-4202ol11">
       Individuals, or entities, exclusive of privately owned electrical generating companies, who are the holders of title or evidence of title to property, but without the boundaries of a municipality, who are the current holders of a right, acquired in accordance with the provisions of chapter 2, title 42, Idaho Code, to appropriate water in an amount equal to or in excess of one (1) cubic foot per second, and who divert water from underground basins within the area of recharge by means of a well or wells, or who divert water from springs or other water courses emerging from such underground basins, or both.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c42s42-4202ol12">
       Municipalities which obtain water from underground basins in the area of recharge. A municipality may elect to be included within the proposed district by a majority vote of the members of its city council. The mayor of any municipality so electing may sign the petition on behalf of the municipality, and such municipality shall constitute one water user for purposes of securing the minimum number of signatures required for the petition.

      Within ninety (90) days after the hearing has been concluded, the director after due consideration of all relevant data and testimony, shall determine whether the proposed district will provide the benefits described, whether the boundaries proposed are proper with respect to the benefits to be provided, and whether the formation of the district will serve the interests of the water users proposed to be benefited. On the basis of his determination, the director shall enter an order either establishing the aquifer recharge district and defining the boundaries thereof to reflect the area to be benefited, or denying the formation of the district. If the director orders formation of the district, he shall cause copies of the order, duly certified, to be filed with the secretary of state and board of county commissioners, county recorder, county assessor and county treasurer of each county in which any part of the district is situated.

     <p>
      At a regular meeting of the board between August 1 and November 1 of each year, the board of directors shall determine the amount necessary to be raised for the maintenance and operation of the works and facilities of the district and the payment of such fees as may be charged to the district for the use of canals or other diversion works owned or operated by a canal company or companies or other entity or entities, and shall levy assessments against the water users in the district sufficient to raise such amount. Moneys received in payment of such assessments shall be deposited in a separate fund to be known as the maintenance and operation fund. The board also may levy assessments against the water users in the district for the repayment of indebtedness incurred by the board on behalf of the district, as provided in section 42-4216, Idaho Code. Money received in payment of such assessments shall be deposited in a separate fund to be known as the debt retirement fund. The board of directors may, in addition, determine the amount necessary to pay the expenses of making the assessment book, giving notice of assessments and making collections thereof and may levy assessments against the water users in the district sufficient to raise such amount. Moneys received in payment of such assessments shall be deposited in a separate fund to be known as the assessment expense fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each water user shall pay a proportionate share of the total of all amounts to be raised for the purposes aforementioned, which share shall be based on the ratio which the quantity of water such water user is authorized to appropriate under his water right or rights bears to the total quantity of water authorized for appropriation under the water rights of all water users in the district; provided, however, that the combined annual assessment against each water user shall not exceed ten dollars ($10.00) per second foot of water the water user is entitled to appropriate under his water right or rights.

      If in any year the board of directors fails to levy assessments for the repayment of indebtedness in amounts sufficient to meet a payment or payments falling due, the lender may bring an action in the district court of any county in which the district is situated to compel the board to levy assessments in amounts sufficient to insure the payment thereof; provided, however, that the board may not be compelled to increase assessments for the repayment of indebtedness if the maximum annual assessment limitation specified in section 42-4215, Idaho Code, will be exceeded thereby. In the event that the maximum annual assessment limitation has been reached and the assessments for repayment of indebtedness nevertheless will be insufficient to meet a payment of [or] payments falling due, the lender may, in the alternative, seek an order requiring that moneys received by the district in payment of assessments for all purposes be first expended for the repayment of that portion of the indebtedness falling due.

     <p>
      After the formation of the district, any water user included within the district may file with the board of directors a petition in writing praying for exclusion from the district. All water users seeking exclusion as are united in interest or to which the same state of facts apply may unite in the same petition. The grounds for exclusion and the time limitations for filing any petition hereunder shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c42s42-4225ol11">
       The water user will not be benefited by the functioning of the district. A petition alleging this ground for exclusion must be filed within ninety (90) days after the formal appointment of the first board of directors by the department of water resources. Any such petition filed after the ninety (90) day period has elapsed shall not be accepted or considered.
      </li>

     </ol>
     <p>
      A petition alleging either of the foregoing grounds for exclusion shall be acknowledged by all the petitioners and shall state in detail the reasons why it is claimed that the petitioners should be excluded from the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immediately after their formal appointment, the board of directors shall cause notice of the deadline for filing petitions under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and a copy of the order of formation of the district and a map indicating the boundaries of the district to be posted in three (3) public places in each county in which a part of the district is situated. In addition, the board shall publish notice of the deadline and the locations at which the order of formation and map of the district may be inspected for at least four (4) successive weeks in a newspaper published or having general circulation in each of the counties in which any part of the district is situated.

       Any time after the filing of the petition for the organization of a district and before the day fixed for the hearing thereon, the owner or owners of any real property within the proposed district may file an objection with the court stating reasons why said property should not be included therein, why his land or any part thereof will not be benefited by the proposed district, and praying that said property be excluded therefrom. Such objection shall be duly verified and shall describe the property sought to be excluded. The court shall, at the hearing, examine and take testimony and evidence on all objections to inclusion in the district.

The clerk of the court having jurisdiction shall publish notice of the time and place of an election to be held in the district.

       Such election shall be held and conducted in the same manner as general elections in this state, except that the court shall establish as many election precincts within such proposed district as are deemed necessary, shall define the boundaries thereof, which precincts and boundaries may thereafter be changed by the board of commissioners of such district if so organized.

       The legislature hereby declares that the welfare of the people of Idaho is dependent upon the effective management of the ground water resources of this state. The legislature further declares that a need exists for the creation of special districts to provide for financing of repair or abandonment of wells in aquifers which have experienced or are experiencing declines in water level or water pressures because of flow, leakage, and waste from improper construction, maintenance and operation of wells drilled into the aquifer. Creation of these special districts may be initiated upon petition submitted by those owning the rights to use the ground water from any aquifers or parts of an aquifer that has been designated as a critical ground water area pursuant to section 42-233a, Idaho Code, or as a ground water management area pursuant to section 42-233b, Idaho Code.

On the basis of his determination, the director shall enter an order either establishing the ground water management district and defining the boundaries thereof to reflect the area to be benefited or denying the formation of the district. If the director orders formation of the district, he shall cause copies of the order, duly certified, to be filed with the secretary of the state and board of county commissioners, county recorder, county assessor and county treasurer of each county in which any part of the district is situated.

       Prior to the incurring of indebtedness, the board shall file a petition in the district court of the county in which the office of the board is located, pursuant to the provisions of sections 43-406 to 43-408, inclusive, Idaho Code, as if the district were an irrigation district. Whenever any district which is required to file a petition hereunder has or proposes to enter into a contract or contracts with one or more districts pursuant to law, and such other district or districts is authorized or required to bring a confirmation proceeding or proceedings pursuant to the provisions of section 43-406 or of section 43-1808, Idaho Code, with respect to such contracts or the levy of assessments or the apportionment of costs, the boards of each of such other districts shall join in the filing of such petition, and the district court in which such petition is filed shall have jurisdiction to hear the petition and to grant the relief prayed for therein. Each such petition shall pray for a judicial examination and determination of any power conferred hereby or by any amendment hereto or of any assessment levied or of any apportionment of costs or of any act, proceeding or contract of the district or districts, whether or not said contracts shall have been executed, including proposed contracts for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, replacement and improvement of any such well and other related structures and works and appurtenances, falling water contracts, contracts with other districts and contracts with other public and private persons, firms, corporations and associations. Such petition shall set forth the facts whereon the validity of such powers, assessments, apportionments, acts, proceedings or contracts is founded. Notice of the filing of said petition shall be given by the clerk of the court by mailing, and by publication in at least one (1) newspaper published and of general circulation within the boundaries of each district joining in the petition, or if no newspaper is so published within any district, then in a newspaper published in the same county in which any part of such district is located which is of general circulation in such district, pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of section 43-407, Idaho Code, as if the district were an irrigation district under the seal thereof, stating in brief outline the contents of the petition and showing where a full copy of any contract or contracts, therein mentioned, may be examined.

       If in any year the board of directors fails to levy assessments for the repayment of indebtedness in amounts sufficient to meet a payment or payments falling due, the lender may bring an action in the district court of any county in which the district is situated to compel the board to levy assessments in amounts sufficient to insure the payment thereof; provided, however, that the board may not be compelled to increase assessments for the repayment of indebtedness if the maximum annual assessment limitation specified in section 42-5113, Idaho Code, will be exceeded thereby.

       <li id="t42c51s42-5129ol11">
        Such excluded water user shall remain liable for payment of assessments previously levied and unpaid at the time of the entry of the order of exclusion, or in case of appeal, the effective date of exclusion.

      If the ground water district board determines to issue assessments through the respective counties, the treasurer of the ground water district first shall prepare a list containing the legal description, the assessor’s parcel number, the name and last known address of the owner of record, and the amount of the assessment for each parcel. The sum assessed and charged against each parcel shall be entered by the ground water district as the operation and maintenance assessment of the (name of district) ground water district. On or before the third Tuesday of July of each year, the list shall be certified by the treasurer of the ground water district to the county auditor of the county in which the lands are located, and the county treasurer shall enter the same upon the tax rolls, as provided by law for the entry of taxes, against the land of each of the persons named in the list, together with the amounts thereof; and the same shall be subject to the same interest and penalties in case of delinquency as in the case of property taxes and shall be collected in the same manner as taxes and subject to the same right of redemption, and the lands sold for the collection of delinquency shall be subject to the same right of redemption as the sale of land for property taxes.

If the legal description of any parcel on any such list differs from the legal description as shown by the assessor’s records, the assessor shall notify the district treasurer of the discrepancy and the district treasurer shall submit to the county assessor an addendum changing the description to conform with the assessor’s records; provided, that where the discrepancy between the descriptions occurs because a portion of the parcel lies outside the district, no change in description shall be required and the district assessments shall be effective only as to the portions of any parcel that are within district boundaries.

      Assessments shall be due and payable on the date specified in the county’s tax notice, shall be collected and accounted for by the county treasurer in the same manner as property taxes, and shall be paid over to the ground water district treasurer together with any penalties or interest collected. The county shall enforce the collection of assessments in the same manner as it enforces the collection of taxes of the county, and failure to pay the assessment shall be subject to the same penalties. The collection of a ground water district’s assessments by the county treasurer shall not make the district’s obligations respecting any bond, contract, debt, or interest the obligation of the county.

      A water user who is delinquent in the payment of any assessment under this chapter, or who has failed to comply with any apportionment of mitigation obligations imposed by the board under this chapter, shall not be entitled to divert ground water until such delinquent assessment is paid in full and noncompliance is remedied in full. To commence enforcement, the district shall submit to the director a report documenting the delinquent assessment or noncompliance with the apportionment of mitigation plan obligations. For delinquent assessments, the report shall contain an accounting of the basis for the assessment, the apportionment of those assessments among district members, and the ground water user’s delinquency in the payment of those assessments. For noncompliance with the apportionment of mitigation plan obligations, the report shall identify the mitigation plan under which the mitigation plan obligations were apportioned, explain the basis for the apportionment of those obligations among district members, and document the water user’s noncompliance with the apportioned mitigation obligations. If, after the director analyzes information in the report, the director concludes that the district has reasonably apportioned those assessments based on the factors set forth in section 42-5232(7), Idaho Code, or has reasonably apportioned those mitigation plan obligations based on the factors set forth in section 42-5244A, Idaho Code, the director shall instruct the water master to curtail all ground water diversions by the water user for which assessments are delinquent or for which the user has not complied with the mitigation obligations apportioned to the user. Any person aggrieved by the action of the director and who has not previously been afforded an opportunity for a hearing on the matter shall be entitled to a hearing before the director to contest the action pursuant to section 42-1701A(3), Idaho Code. No district shall commence enforcement under the provisions of this section prior to January 1, 2020. The director shall not curtail ground water diversions based on delinquent assessments levied prior to April 1, 2019, or based on mitigation plan noncompliance that occurred prior to April 1, 2019.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon written request from any ground water user who is not a member of a district, a district board of directors may enter a contract with such nonmember pursuant to which the nonmember shall be allowed to participate fully in, and obtain all benefits of, any mitigation plan, purpose or activity the district currently has in force or is developing, pursuant to terms and conditions acceptable to both parties, provided that:

       The board finds that the plan is likely to be effective in mitigating the effects of such nonmember’s ground water use, and that including the nonmember within the mitigation plan’s coverage will not impair the plan’s effectiveness as to district members;

      <li id="t42c52s42-5259ol12">

      <li id="t42c52s42-5259ol13">
       Before the contract may be effective, the board may collect from the nonmember a payment adequate to compensate the district for the nonmember’s proportional share of the costs the district already has incurred in developing and implementing the mitigation plan;
      </li>
      <li id="t42c52s42-5259ol14">
       The board may include in the contract a provision requiring the nonmember to pay a reasonable surcharge, either annually or on some other basis, to reimburse the district for such nonmember’s proportional share of those past or future costs of operating the district attributable to formulating or implementing the mitigation plan or plans in which the nonmember is participating;

       The boards of directors shall canvass the returns of the election as provided in case of usual ground water district elections, and shall immediately thereafter transmit, by messenger or registered mail, certified abstracts of the result of said election in their respective districts to the clerk of the county commission. Within ten (10) days after such returns are received by the clerk, the county commission shall meet and canvass the same.

       If it appears that a majority of all the votes cast in each of said districts is “Consolidation—Yes.” said board shall make an order, and enter the same of record in its minutes, establishing said consolidated district, giving its boundaries and designation, and in detail the terms under which the consolidation has been effected, and dividing said consolidated districts into three (3) divisions, and shall appoint some person qualified under this title, to act as director for each of said divisions of said district until the next general election for the election of officers, when a board of directors shall be elected as provided in section 42-5218, Idaho Code; provided however, that the organization of such district shall not take effect until the first Tuesday of the January following said order of its establishment. If the date provided by law for the election of directors shall come between the date of said order of the county commission and the first Tuesday of January, then in making such order the board shall designate the board of directors of one (1) of the consolidated districts as a board to take charge of such election, and in that case a director shall be elected for each such division of the consolidated district, and no appointment of directors shall be made by the county commission.
    (6) If, however, upon such canvass by the county commission, it appears that a majority of the votes cast in any district thus proposed to be consolidated is “Consolidation—No,” then a record of that fact shall be entered in the same minutes of the county commission, and all the proceedings had under the preceding sections of this chapter shall be void.

      § 42-5274. Procedure for consolidating one ground water district within another having substantially larger ground water diversions.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In those cases where the cumulative total ground water diversions (excluding diversions under domestic and stockwater rights) in one (1) district are less than one-tenth (1/10) of such diversions in the larger district, and the boards of directors deem it for the best interests of the respective districts that the two (2) districts be consolidated into a single district, such boards may seek to consolidate according to the following procedure as an alternative to that described in section 42-5273, Idaho Code:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t42c52s42-5274ol11">
       The boards may propose a contract between them setting forth the terms and conditions of consolidating the district having the smaller ground water diversions into the other district, with the name and officers of the district having the larger ground water diversions still retained.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c52s42-5274ol12">
       Once both boards have approved the contract, it shall be submitted for approval by the members of the district having the smaller ground water diversions, together with the question of whether the two (2) districts shall be consolidated under the contract’s terms, at a special election held for that purpose in such district. Notice of the election shall be published as required for notices of election for indebtedness. At the election should two-thirds (2/3) of the electors voting, vote in favor of the contract and the consolidation of the districts, the board of directors of the district having the smaller ground water diversions shall petition the board of directors of the district having the larger ground water diversions, which notice shall be published in a newspaper published within the county wherein the office of the board of directors of the district having the larger ground water diversions is situated, for such length of time and covering the same matters as required by a petition to annex land and/or facilities into a district.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c52s42-5274ol13">
       The law applicable to the annexation of land into a district after the petition is filed and notice given, shall apply to the consolidation, including an annexation of a smaller district into a larger district.
      </li>
      <li id="t42c52s42-5274ol14">
       After the board of directors of the district having the larger ground water diversions has approved the resolution or other decision including within its boundaries the district having the smaller ground water diversions, the board shall file a petition in the district court within the county wherein the principal office of its district is situated, asking for an approval and confirmation of the proceedings thereunder, and the same procedure shall be followed as provided in sections 43-406 through 43-408, Idaho Code, with reference to the confirmation of the proceedings within irrigation districts. In such petition the prayer shall be that the proceedings, together with the contract, may be examined and approved by the court; that after the confirmation of said proceedings the order of the board of directors admitting the smaller district into the district having the larger ground water diversions, containing a description of all the land properly certified by the secretary of the district, shall be filed for record in the office of the recorder of both counties with which the petition was filed.
